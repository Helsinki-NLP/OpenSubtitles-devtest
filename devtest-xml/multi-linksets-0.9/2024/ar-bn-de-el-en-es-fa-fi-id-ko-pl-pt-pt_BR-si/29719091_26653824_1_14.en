Mi-ja ... 
There was a time when our lives were consumed by sadness . 
Honey ! Where are you going ? 
Honey , this isn 't the time . Not now ... Mom . 
Let go of me . 
Sang-tae ... 
Sang-tae . 
Please let me go inside . 
Please let me say good-bye to Mi-ja . 
Sang-tae ... 
Sang-tae . 
Just once . 
Please give me one chance to say goodbye to her . 
I want to see her one last time ! 
Please let me say goodbye to her , Sang-tae . 
You should 've died by yourself ! 
Why did you kill my daughter ? You should 've died by yourself ! 
Why did you take my daughter ? Why ? 
Get out ! I said get out ! 
- Ms . Yang . - Why ? 
- Get out ! - Ms . Yang . 
- I 'm sorry , Ms. Yang . - Get out ! 
- Ms . Yang . - Oh , God ! I don 't want to see you ! Get out ! 
FUNERAL 
I can 't go on without you ! 
I can 't go on , Mi-ja ! 
Enduring this sadness in our own ways was difficult , and we didn 't have the strength to embrace each other 's pain . 
Our sadness simply left too much pain back then . 
Unbelievable . 
He 's still acting like that ? 
He let out all that anger on Mom back then . 
She kneeled and begged him for forgiveness for years . 
That 's right . 
I was young at the time , but I still remember . 
She felt so guilty she couldn 't leave the house for years . 
And he 's been like this ever since . 
That 's not true . 
He acted this way eight years ago so Yong-pil and Sam-dal would break up . 
Then , he 'd been quiet for some time , but now he 's started again . 
Dad , what did you say ? Eight years ago ? 
Does that mean they didn 't want to break up with each other ? 
It was because of Mr. Cho ? 
Seriously ? Holy cow . 
So is he angry again now because of those two ? 
Because they still clearly like each other ? 
Can you two also tell they like each other again ? 
It 's not " again . " 
It looks like they never stopped liking each other . 
I knew it was strange that Sam-dal could never meet a decent guy after breaking up with Yong-pil . 
I heard Yong-pil 's been single all this time . 
So isn 't it obvious , Dad ? 
They weren 't an ordinary couple . They 've always been together since birth . 
It must 've been too hard to move on . 
I feel terrible for Mom . 
That no-good ... 
- Hold on . - Where are you going ? 
I 'll end this matter with him once and for all . 
Dad , please . Just stay put for now . 
Mom 's already tried once . 
Didn 't you see her ? She 's right . 
I 've never seen her confront Mr. Cho like that before . 
She 'd felt so bad she couldn 't even talk to him . 
Mr. Cho seemed pretty surprised too . 
Of course , he was . 
It was the first time in 20 years I heard Mom mention Ms. Bu . 
It wasn 't her choice to not mention her for 20 years . 
She just couldn 't . 
She couldn 't dare to . 
You think you 're the only one in pain and the only one who 's grieving her ? 
I 'm in just as much pain as you are . 
And I miss her just as much as you do . 
I do too ! 
I miss Mi-ja too ! 
If the tide had been slightly higher , you would 've been in huge trouble . 
What possessed you to go there during high tide ? 
Didn 't you see the warning sign ? 
Yong-pil , we need to talk . 
Yong-pil . 
Yeah ? 
When we were kids , remember how I 'd always cut my tongue eating candy because I forgot to chew it ? 
Of course , I do . 
That 's why I always told you when to chew it . 
Right . 
We always did that ever since we were kids . 
But after we broke up , I realized I still hadn 't learned to chew . 
I guess I thought you 'd always be around to tell me . 
So did you keep cutting your tongue ? 
No . 
I stopped eating candy after that . 
Because every time I cut my tongue ... it would remind me of you . 
And then , it would hurt again . 
So I just stopped eating candy . 
I worked like a dog and avoided anything that was related to you . 
Well , it didn 't really work out . 
But you were different . 
What do you mean ? 
It seems you didn 't try to avoid ... or forget about me . 
The theme for Magazine X 's summer photoshoot this year is mirrors . 
It feels like there was never a moment ... 
CHO YONG-PIL when you weren 't a part of my life . 
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER OF 2023 , CHO EUN-HYE 
Weren 't you in pain ? 
I was . 
It hurt . 
But ... What if I tried so hard to forget you ... that I really did forget you ? 
What if I missed you and wanted to see you so much 
that I tried to remember your face ... but couldn 't remember it ? 
You mean so much to me . 
Sam-dal , you see , I didn 't want to be without you for a single moment in my life . 
That 's why ... I didn 't forget about you . 
Yong-pil ... I don 't want a one-sided love . 
No , I won 't do it . 
We tried to move on for eight years , but it didn 't work . So what can we do ? 
Isn 't a one-sided love so unfair for us ? 
So let 's just ... Let 's do it . 
Let 's just be together . 
Let 's just be in love , okay ? 
Okay . 
Let 's do that . 
Love . 
Let 's be in love . 
- Sam-dal . - Yes ? 
Even if my dad keeps refusing to accept us , 
you can 't let me go like eight years ago . 
I won 't . 
I won 't let you go now . 
I 'll never let you go again . 
By the way ... 
Even if your dad never gives us his blessing , let 's always hold onto each other even if it hurts . 
- Okay ? - Okay . 
Okay . 
I 'll get going now . 
What 's this pity party you 're throwing by yourself ? 
Pour me a drink too . 
Sang-do . 
How about just confessing your feelings to Sam-dal ? 
I know everything . I 've always known . 
You 're so persistent too . How many years has it been ? 
Jeez . 
Gyeong-tae thinks Yong-pil and Sam-dal are trying to get back together . 
So tell her before it 's too late . 
Tell her ? 
- What happens if I do ? 
- If she says no , then that 's that . 
It 'll be at least better than suffering alone for a decade . 
I 'll feel better , but Sam-dal will feel terrible . 
That 's ... 
That 's something she 'll have to deal with . 
You know what ? 
When I said I liked someone , she was so eager to help me . 
She 's never had feelings for me . 
If I tell her I 've had feelings for her , she 'll be the one who has to deal with feeling sorry and uncomfortable . 
That 'd be so selfish of me . 
Come on , Sang-do . 
I never had a chance . 
I mean , after around 30 years , even the most well-built buildings are bound to form cracks too . 
So how is it possible ... that I still ... don 't have even the slightest opening 
AS Group ... I 'm the one who hates them the most ! 
Just the thought of them sends chills down my spine ! 
I see ... 
Okay , I understand . 
What is it ? 
Isn 't it a system error ? 
My credit cards were working just fine this morning . 
Sir ... I think things have tipped over the edge . 
What ? 
What do you mean ? 
You 're making me nervous . 
What 's wrong , Secretary Ko ? 
What ? 
Are you talking about Mom ? 
Yeah . 
We were shocked too . I 've never seen her act that way towards him . 
Where 's Mom ? Outside ? 
And what exactly is your plan ? To console her ? 
Look , just play dumb . 
Don 't be ridiculous . 
For crying out loud . 
Then what ? Are you going to break up with Yong-pil again ? 
- What ? - Just play dumb and get back together with him . 
I see . 
Think about it . 
She spoke her mind to Mr. Cho for the first time in 20 years . 
She faced him head-on . 
Don 't you know why she did that ? 
It 's obvious to me . 
If you guys break up again , Mom will feel eternally guilty about it . 
Do you understand ? 
Yes . 
I know it worries you , but leave this matter to the elders . 
And don 't blame them later on . 
Look at you acting like a big sister . 
I was always the big sister . 
If you understood , go tell Yong-pil now that you want to get back together . 
What are you talking about ... 
Hey ! If you want to persuade Mr. Cho , you need to be in a relationship first . 
Are you going to get back together only after he gives you his blessing ? 
Go now . Go and say you want to get back together . 
- If you can 't , I 'll do it . 
- Are you crazy ? Why would you do that ? 
- Yong-pil ! - We 're already back together ! 
What did you say ? 
We already got back together . 
What ? You 're back together ? Why ? 
I mean , since when ? 
- Yesterday . - Yesterday ? 
God , I feel so betrayed . 
Were you two being all lovey-dovey while we were in chaos yesterday ? 
My goodness , look at her smile . 
Tell us . 
Unbelievable . 
Come on ! 
About what ? 
Does it feel good ? 
Yeah . 
What is it ? 
Yong-pil and I are back together . 
I won 't force myself to hold back anymore . 
We 'll never be apart again . 
So Mom , don 't feel guilty about us . 
Don 't be sorry . 
Good job . 
You did well . 
- Quick . - Are you sleeping outside ? 
You said these were useless and heavy . 
Hey , when did I say that ? I like items that make things cozy like these too . 
You 're going with Sam-dal , aren 't you ? 
Just how many collars are you wearing ? Look at this fool . 
Two . 
See you . 
Look at him skipping away . Jeez . 
I 'm so jealous . 
So jealous ! 
By the way , why did you go to Sagyemul ? 
Was it because you could see the Tyndall effect well ? 
Yeah . 
How did you know ? 
There 's nothing I don 't know . I know everything . 
But the Tyndall effect is best seen during sunrise on oreum volcanic cones . 
Really ? 
Should we go see it the day after tomorrow ? 
The clouds will be low , so you 'll see it well . 
We 'll have to go up early in the morning for the sunrise . 
Right , since the sun 's rising . 
Or how about this ? Why don 't we go camping tomorrow ? 
- Camping ? 
- Yeah . 
You want to spend the night there ? 
Yeah . 
Just the two of us ? 
Should we invite Gyeong-tae ? 
Hey , why would you bring him along when it 'll be us two ? 
Let 's go . 
What else do I need ? 
It 'll be cold , so I should bring hand warmers . Let 's see ... 
I think they were here . Where are they ? 
Here they are . 
But would I really need them ? 
It 's still warm . 
And they 're really heavy . 
What in the world are you doing ? 
What are you doing in my house ? What ? 
Mom ? 
Sit down and eat , Yong-pil . 
- It 's sea urchin and seaweed soup . - What ? 
Why are you standing there ? 
Aren 't you going to eat ? 
Have you gone insane ? 
Why would I eat this ? 
Leave while I 'm asking nicely . 
If not , then go to your room . 
I 'm here to feed him . 
Sit down , Yong-pil . 
What ? 
Okay . 
You little ... 
Why are you making food for my son ? 
Sang-tae , he 's my son as well . 
Just like how my three daughters are also Bu Mi-ja 's daughters , Yong-pil 's my son too . 
Mi-ja and I made a promise . 
Can 't a mother feed her own son ? 
You 're his mother ? 
You killed his mother ! 
I never killed her ! 
If so , then why am I still here ? 
I would 've been locked up ages ago ! 
Have you lost your mind ? 
Have you decided to forget everything you 've done and act out ? 
I 've been begging you for forgiveness for 20 years . 
After that long , how could I possibly be sane ? 
Since I lived like a sinner , it turned my children into sinners too . 
I won 't live like that anymore . 
For Mi-ja 's sake and for our children 's sakes , I 'm not going to do that anymore . 
My goodness , you really have gone crazy . 
Goodness . 
I 'll put soup in the fridge . Heat it up and have it for dinner ! 
It 's been bottled up for 20 years . 
Yong-pil , don 't resent your father , no matter what he does . 
I won 't be able to face your mother if you do . You got that ? 
Goodness . Like mother , like daughter . Sam-dal said the same thing . 
I got it , so don 't worry . 
Eat up . 
- Put the rest in the fridge . - Okay . 
- I 'm going . - Okay . 
Thank you for the food . 
Dad . 
What is it ? 
Are you happy that she cooked for you ? 
Yes , I 'm pretty happy . 
You should come out and take a look . See who she made the food for . 
Who likes top shells without cucumbers , sea urchin and seaweed soup , and bracken ? 
They 're your favorites , not mine . 
It 's obvious that she made all of it for you . 
Dad , don 't throw out the food anymore . 
Okay ? 
Sam-dal ! 
- Cho Sam-dal ! - Coming ! 
- Ms . Cho ! - Ms . Cho ! 
What in the world ? 
How are you here ? 
Wait , what happened ? 
We said we 'd come join you after helping you . 
No matter how small the exhibition is , you still need ADs . 
That 's right . 
But there 's not much to do right now . I 've only been taking photos . 
I 'm glad we came . I knew this would happen . 
You 're taking the photos all by yourself without any help . 
That 's right . 
I 'm not exactly alone . 
They did provide someone who 's a sort of helper . 
It would 've been so much better if I 'd known you were coming today ! 
So this is your house . 
I 've never seen you like this before . 
You looked so sophisticated and cool back in Seoul ... 
What ? Do I look uncool now ? 
No , now you just seem like a neighborhood friend . 
Then , treat me like one . 
- No , I can 't do that . - Right . 
Oh , right ! 
For just in case , I brought filming equipment and props just in case you needed them . 
What should we do first ? 
Hey , you just got here . Why are you so eager to work ? 
You have nothing to do today . First , just rest . And then - - 
Sam-dal , we have to go work ! 
He said , " We have to go work . " 
Well ... 
Give me a minute . 
- Just rest . And eat this . - Okay . 
I 'll be back . 
I won 't be long . 
Let 's go work . 
Hey , they 're here to work with me , so you can 't mention that . 
But we agreed to go - - 
I 'll try to slip out after telling them to rest . 
- Just wait a bit , okay ? 
- But - - 
- Timing 's - - - Ms . Cho , we 're ready to work . 
Girls , you can 't go camping on your first day . It 'll be exhausting . 
She 's right . You won 't be able to sleep well . 
And there 's no place to wash up , so it 's a bit uncomfortable . 
Exactly . 
The two of us will handle it today . 
There 's a lot of pretty coffee shops along the beach . 
- Go there and - - - Ms . Cho , that 's enough . 
We came to Jeju to work , not do a tour of coffee shops . 
You 're the one who said , " Hey , Eun-bi . Let 's go to work . " 
Right . 
Why did I do that ? 
And it 's normal not to shower or sleep . It 's a on-location shoot . 
By the way , this KMA exhibition is amazing . 
They even paired you with an employee . 
The weather 's so nice . 
Look how well-behaved she is . 
Is she really the same ferocious Ms. Yang from yesterday ? 
She seems to calm down quick after throwing a fit . 
- Right . - Right . Goodness . 
I don 't know if it 's her dementia messing with her memory or if it 's because of how much she misses her daughter . 
- Goodness . - Probably both . 
Goodness . By the way , I wonder how Ms. Ko is doing . 
Ms. Yang pulled a fistful of her hair out yesterday . 
The good news is she 's always had a lot of hair . 
Fortunately , she didn 't lose all her hair . 
- Is she okay ? 
- Hey , Sang-tae . 
Wasn 't she shaken up yesterday ? 
She wasn 't , but I was . 
Has she been taking her medication ? 
Maybe I have dementia too . 
I keep forgetting to give it to her . 
Mother , make sure to take your medication . 
- I 'll head to work . - Okay . 
Sang-tae . 
Mi-ja ... 
Don 't resent her too much . 
Why would I resent my wife ? 
Don 't worry . 
Yes , I sent it through express mail . 
Are you sure there 's a vacancy ? 
Yes , they 're only hiring those with experience . 
So you have a shot as long as AS doesn 't get in the way . 
You had a high performance rating too . 
Of course , I did . I was at the top . 
But I 'm not sure . 
I know you want to return to work , Jin-dal . 
Yeah , I do . 
Anyway , thanks . I 'll treat you once I 'm back . 
Wait . Why is he coming out of that place ? 
Secretary Ko . 
Yes , sir ? 
I 'm paying you three times more than what my brother used to pay you . 
That 's right . 
So how could you make me spend the night here ? 
My back is killing me . 
I said I 'd pay you back in Seoul . 
Still , I 'm not rich enough to spend 500,000 won on a hotel room . 
This was the best I could do . 
You have a credit card . 
As soon as the words " motel " or " hotel " appear on my credit statement , my wife will kill me . 
But if just you tell her the truth - - 
If I told her the truth about how my boss was caught trying to secretly move the theme park from Namdal-ri to Samdal-ri and was abandoned by the chairman , then I 'll probably be looking for a new job . 
The chairman didn 't abandon me . 
How did my father find out so quickly ? 
Hey . I 'm glad you 're here , Jin-dal . 
- Hello , sir . - Everyone left this morning . 
Where did they go ? 
- Back to Namdal-ri . - What ? 
All the townspeople are upset . 
They feel betrayed . 
How could he ask busy people to take time out to meet and then just leave like that ? 
I 'll look into it . 
Gosh . 
There he is . 
Secretary Ko . 
Keep driving . Don 't stop . Don 't stop the car . 
What ? 
Hey , what in the world ? 
- Hey , Jeon Dae-yeong ! - Okay . 
Sir , you can 't run away like this forever . 
Ms. Cho deserves an explanation . 
How can I explain after I boasted about how she could trust me ? 
Then , going back to Seoul and persuading the chairman ... 
He even froze my corporate card . Don 't you know what that means ? 
He wants me off this project . 
What 's your plan then ? 
What do you think ? 
I have to bring the project back to Samdal-ri at all costs . 
- I love it here ! 
- It 's so pretty ! - This is so nice ! 
Your friends over there from the mainland ... are so innocent . 
- So pretty ! 
- Does it look good ? 
I want to take one too . 
I guess they 're not the considerate type who think about how others feel . 
Yeah ... 
By the way , how many tents did you bring ? 
I brought two of them . 
But we have to split into pairs . 
Three people can 't fit into one . 
Ms. Cho , come here quick ! 
Hurry up ! 
Let 's do it . 
- Cheers . - Cheers . 
This is my first time drinking wine outdoors . 
Tell me about it . 
I can 't believe you brought wine . 
Well , the idea was to have a cozy time - - 
It 's totally cozy and the mood 's amazing . 
All of this must 've been very heavy to carry . 
That 's right . It was really heavy when I was carrying all this . 
I also carried the tents , so my shoulders are - - 
- Really ? 
- Yeah , right here . 
Want me to massage them ? 
- Yeah , right there . - Here ? 
Here . 
Ms. Cho , you seem to have changed a lot after moving back to your hometown . 
Me ? 
She 's right . You 've definitely changed . 
You even speak differently . 
Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm still the same . 
No . Back in Seoul , you always looked tense and focused because you didn 't want to make a mistake . 
But you look so much at ease here . 
We 're drinking , and you 're not even recording . 
You even recorded yourself out of caution when you drank alone . 
Come to think of it , I 've never recorded myself in Jeju . 
Maybe it 's because you 're with someone you 're comfortable with . 
Hey , I was comfortable with you too . 
- Really ? 
- Of course . 
- It 's true , right ? 
- Cheers to that . 
It 's cold though , isn 't it ? 
- I think so . - You 're cold ? Hold on . 
You can use this . 
- Thank you . - Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Here 's your blanket . 
What is it ? 
What ? 
Nothing . 
By the way , I 'm guessing you two didn 't get new jobs at other studios . 
We did receive all kinds of offers . 
If you 've worked under Ms. Cho , you gain a lot of respect in our industry . 
I see . 
So why are you waiting for me ? 
Who knows when I 'll go back to Seoul ? 
Find another job already . 
We don 't want to . 
We 're only going work for you . 
Your house seemed pretty spacious earlier . 
We could clean it . 
- I 'm in . - Are you insane ? 
Why would you give up on your careers ? Don 't quit ! 
We won 't , and we 'll always stick with you . 
Me too . 
Jeez . 
Who told you to come here and say such moving things ? 
Cheers . 
Cheers . 
Hey , Sang-tae . 
Dae-seong , where are you headed ? 
To the restaurant . 
- They need some change . - I see . 
Are you drinking by yourself again ? 
Let 's drink together . I 'll come back after I give them the money . 
Sit here and drink , okay ? 
- Okay . - Okay . 
All right . 
Get lost before I beat you up . 
Yong-pil and Sam-dal didn 't see each other for eight years . Not even once . 
Don 't provoke me . 
But they still liked each other that whole time . 
Like father , like son . 
What did you say ? 
Have you lost your mind and want to die ? 
I have ! 
You only thought about your late wife , and you ignored your son 's suffering for the past eight years . 
What ? 
How dare you be so brazen ? 
What more do you want ? 
After your wife passed , every night for ten years , my wife cried by herself under a blanket ! 
- Okay ? 
- You little ... 
She couldn 't tell anyone because of her guilt . 
And she cried under a blanket ! 
How dare you , Pan-sik ? 
Do you really want to die tonight ? 
- Damn it . - You bastard . Pan-sik , you little ... 
What do you know ? 
How about you ? What do you know ? 
How dare you , Pan-sik ? 
Why are you guys fighting ? 
You know nothing . 
My vision keeps getting blurrier , and my memory falters . 
Some days , 
I can 't remember what she looks like , so I stare at her photo all day . 
So what do you know ? 
You don 't know anything ! 
All done . 
Enjoy . The tangerines should be good . 
Everything 's set . Excuse yourself from the uninvited guests . 
It 's him , right ? 
The Paris Magazine Gallery 's sole visitor , Cho Yong-pil . 
You 're childhood friends ? And you 're doing the exhibition together ? 
Are you two dating by any chance ? 
Hey ! 
She came here after what Cheon Chung-gi did to her . 
You think she 'd want to start dating ? 
- Right . - Right ? 
I 'm sorry . 
Should we call it a night ? 
It 's late . Just leave this here and go in . 
- Is that okay ? 
- Of course . 
Okay . 
It 's cold , so make sure to wrap your sleeping bags around you , okay ? 
Good night . 
Ms. Cho , wait ! 
- What ? 
- Isn 't Forecaster Cho in there ? 
Yeah , but this tent is for two people . So I 'll just sleep here . 
What ? 
We 've known each other for 38 years . It 's okay . 
You can relax and go to sleep , okay ? 
But still , that 's not right . 
We 're both slim , so just squeeze in . 
I sleep on my side anyway . 
Squeeze in for what ? Just relax and sleep . It 's okay . 
Don 't make it uncomfortable on yourself . 
- Let 's just sleep together . Really . I 'm okay . 
- We 're okay too . - But I 'm - - - No . - I said I 'm fine ! 
- It 's okay ! - Girls ! 
We 're dating . 
We 're dating . 
So it 's okay . 
I 'm sorry . 
I had no idea they 'd suddenly come here . 
I 'm sorry , okay ? 
What 's their problem , anyway ? 
We said we 're dating , but why did they stop us ? 
Just why would they do that ? 
I told them we 'd only been a couple for two days , so they - - 
It doesn 't matter how many days it 's been . 
I bought wine and hung up lights for the first time in my life . 
I pulled out all the stops . 
Come on , I said I was sorry ! 
I was excited too . I didn 't even bring hand warmers on purpose . 
Why not ? 
Because I have you to keep me warm . 
Let 's go again another day , okay ? 
All right . 
But are they going to tag along again ? 
No , we 'll leave them behind no matter what . 
Really ? 
Yeah , let 's leave them behind . 
Let 's dispose them on Hallasan Mountain so deer can use them . 
I know they seem a bit clueless , but they 're really special to me . 
I could tell . 
They really like you . 
They do . 
They 're great , and yet I left them behind . 
Get on Bus 7780 headed for Bongsan and get off at Samdal-ri . 
Hello , Mr. Cho . 
Even though I said how against it I was ... do you have to keep seeing her ? 
Yes . 
Why ? 
Because ... Sam-dal 's the only one for me . 
Just like how Mom was the only one for you . 
I ... can 't live without Sam-dal . 
Bu Mi-ja is the woman you 'll forever love and remember . And for me , that 's Sam-dal . 
So , even if it 's not as much as Mom ... could you think about me too now ? 
What ... What 's up with your head ? 
Cho Yong-pil 's hair . 
Doesn 't it look the same as his hair ? 
My dear friend ... 
It makes me want to crush your head . Are you crazy ? 
Don 't look anything like him . 
Really ? 
Too bad , I spent a lot of money so you like it . 
Hey , Cho Sang-tae 
Why do you like me so much ? 
I don 't know . I just love everything about you . 
I like you from head to toe . Everything . 
There 's no reason for liking someone . 
My heart belongs to Cho Yong-pil . 
There 's no place for you in my heart . 
I 'm fine with that , because you are in my heart . 
Even though your heart is full of Cho Yong-pil for now , I might eventually have some chance to get into your heart . 
What if you never get the chance ? 
Well ... 
I can 't help it . 
Let 's go , Ha-yul ... 
What ? Where did she go ? 
Cha Ha-yul ! 
Why are you coming from there ? 
Wear this . 
This is Aunt Jin-dal 's . 
Why would I wear it ? 
You need a necklace around your neck . 
Really ? 
Then I 'll wear mine . I have one too . 
Just wear it . 
It 's pretty . 
What is she so focused on drawing ? 
I told you she 'd have fun . 
Thanks . 
Hey , that 's a pretty necklace . 
This ? 
It 's ... 
Thanks . 
What 's that ? 
This ? 
A gift for Ha-yul . 
The placards Ha-yul made for us last time were a total hit . 
Everyone wanted to hold them . 
I think she has a talent for art . 
Really ? 
She donated her talents to a good cause then . 
- So this is for her ? - Yeah . 
I was going to make placards to protest against the theme park . But did they move it back to Namdal-ri ? 
Yeah . 
Why are you sighing ? 
Isn 't that a good thing ? 
I heard all the haenyeos voted " No . " 
The theme park needs to be built here to stop my mom from diving . 
Well ... 
My mom has a heart condition , so she shouldn 't be diving . But she still insists on doing it . 
At least the theme park would prevent her from diving . 
I see . 
I didn 't know she had a heart condition . 
Yeah . 
What about you ? 
Were you against it because of the dolphins ? 
That 's right . 
Loud noises can be dangerous for them . 
Construction would be so noisy . 
My mom is extremely stubborn . 
She could put herself in danger while diving . She doesn 't even think about her concerned daughters . 
You can just dive with her then . 
What ? 
You can just dive with her if you 're worried . 
You were a swimmer . 
Well , that is true . 
No , that 's ridiculous . I 'm not a haenyeo . 
Then , become one . What 's stopping you ? You said you 're worried about her . 
That 's true . 
Mom . 
Hey , Ha-yul . 
Come , sit down . 
All right . 
Here , this is for you . 
This is for drawing the placards so nicely . 
I see . Thank you . 
You wanted to grow up fast , right ? Then , drink that so you can grow tall . 
Okay . 
Ha-yul , I want to keep you small like this . 
I don 't want you to grow up fast . 
Mom , it would be terrifying if I remained this size forever . 
Gosh . You 're dying to go , aren 't you ? 
Hurry and sign up . 
Forget it . I 'm not going . 
Don 't you think it 's a waste of your skills to be stuck here in Jeju ? 
Soon , you 'll be too old to go . 
I said forget it . I 'm not going . 
What do you have to lose ? Just sign up . 
Hello ? 
Hi , how are you ? 
Mr. Cho suddenly requested leave and didn 't come to work . 
Is something going on ? 
What ? 
My dad ? 
Dad . 
Dad . 
What ? 
What are you doing here then ? 
Do you have any idea where he could have gone ? 
Yong-pil . 
I know where he went . 
I think he went to my mom . 
Then , that means he 's at the temple ? 
Yeah . 
I just called them . 
They said he was there . 
I think he packed up and went this morning . 
You know what ? 
I had gotten my hopes up . I thought maybe he 'd finally care about my feelings . 
But I was wrong . 
I don 't know what to do . 
He 's built this big wall around himself . And it just won 't break down . 
Now , I don 't know what to do anymore . 
Yong-pil . 
What is it ? 
Did you come here by yourself to get an earful from me ? 
You can give me an earful if you want . 
Don 't you resent me ? 
Aren 't you afraid of me ? 
No . 
I 've never resented or been afraid of you . 
How come ? 
Because I know you don 't actually hate me . 
You just ... loved Ms. Bu very much . 
I remember how much you adored me . 
When I was young , you 'd always say , " Be my daughter , Sam-dal . " 
You used to say that . 
What made me sad was the same man who adored me so much ... became someone who resent me overnight . 
You just changed . 
It really broke my heart . 
Didn 't you come here to persuade me ? 
I just came here to whine . 
It 's just something I 've always wanted to say . 
You can resent me all you like , but I 'd never do the same to you . 
Because I know why you feel that way . 
I 'm going to wait . 
I 'll hold Yong-pil 's hand tight and wait . 
I 'll wait for you , Mr. Cho . 
Sam-dal . 
Yes ? 
You really can 't live without Yong-pil ? 
You know the answer . 
I 've always had feelings for only Yong-pil . 
And I 'll probably only love him forever , until the day I die . 
You see this hackberry tree ? 
Think of me as this tree . 
What are you talking about ? 
Even if none of the townspeople care about it , it still shields us from the wind and gives us shade . 
Just like this hackberry tree , even if you don 't love me back , I 'll love you forever . 
You mean it ? 
Of course . 
I 'll love you forever until the day I die . 
I 'll only cherish you and ... only love you . 
Oh , dear . 
My goodness . 
Sam-dal . 
What are you doing here ? 
Did you meet my dad ? 
Yes . 
Sam-dal ! 
Mr. Cho . 
You two have my blessing . 
Sorry ? 
You can be together ! 
Go ahead . 
Cho Sam-dal ...
