( Queen of Divorce ) 
Kim Young A likes you so much . 
It 's not your business . 
Are you joining her camp ? 
- Why are you curious ? 
- Seo Yun is coming back soon . 
- Can I meet him ? - Of course . 
But we should be a family first . 
Let 's ... get married again . 
( Hanjoo Party ) 
- Have you gone mad ? - Remember what I told you ? 
You would always be my first for everything . 
Be my first again , if you will . 
I even hate the idea of being the last woman for you . 
Then think only about Seo Yun . 
Imagine how badly Seo Yun must want to live with his mother . 
You 're not asking me for his sake . It 's because of Ms. Kim Young A. 
What 's so bad about that ? 
Just think about winning her over to our side ... and building Chayul Town . 
Seo Yun 's life will be on a whole new level . 
His life will be more than just comfortable . 
Nothing will ever stop him . 
Stop using him to get your way . 
Gosh . You 're driving me crazy . 
How could you be angry about this ? 
You 'll be happy because you 'll have Seo Yun in your life . 
I 'll be happy because I 'll have connections to Ms. Kim Young A. 
Then Seo Yun will be happy to have his mother in his life . 
This will be a huge win for everyone . 
Can 't you put two and two together ? 
No , you 're wrong . It will be a huge win for a greedy rat . 
Gosh . Come on . 
Seo Yun . 
- It 's me . - Hi , Mom . 
Did you have a nice day at school ? 
You 'll go on a school break soon . 
Yes . That 's why I 'm coming to Seoul next month . 
When I come back , will I be able to see you ? 
Of course . We 'll definitely meet . 
I 'll make sure of that . 
Okay . I miss you so much , Mom . 
Seo Yun . I 'm sorry that we 're apart , so you ended up missing me . 
I 'll call you again . 
- I love you . - I love you too . 
Gosh . That 's a load of nonsense ! 
Hey , this is absurd ! 
Sa Ra . Should I go out and buy you a doll ? 
We can put it up here and stab it with a bamboo needle . Yes ? 
What 's up with that gaze of yours ? 
Don 't tell me you 're considering it . 
No , right ? 
Is it because of your son ? 
Come on , Sa Ra . 
Whenever I think about Seo Yun , I feel like an awful mother who only cares about herself . 
Then I feel like a crazy woman ... for getting tempted by his offer like this . 
Seriously . I 'm such a mess . 
Hey . 
( Episode 9 ) 
Okay . Tell him not to be late . 
Mom , I 'm going into a meeting . 
It 's not just a regular date . It 's a blind date for marriage ? 
Aren 't you a bit too young to think about marriage ? 
Well , my mom kept pestering me about these dates . 
I envy you ... that you have a pestering mom . 
Ms. Kim Sa Ra ? 
Yes . 
Sir , I got it . I 'll give it to her . 
Okay . 
- Thank you . - Have a good day . 
Is there a special occasion ? 
No . But even if there was a special occasion , who would send me stuff like that ? 
What is it ? 
How beautiful . 
( From Noh Yul Seong ) 
Gosh . That was random . 
Wait . Is something going on with you and Mr. Noh Yul Seong ? 
No . 
- Return this . - Yes , ma 'am . 
No . I 'll do it . 
( Mom ) 
Hello ? 
Who is this ? 
I see . I 'm sorry . 
Oh , right . You can make a phone call first . 
No . I can 't do it anyway . 
I was calling Mom . 
I see . 
The machine always said the number didn 't exist . But someone has taken her number already . 
I used to make a lot of those calls to my parents too ... when my parents passed away . 
Well , are you all right ? 
Yes . 
What is it ? 
It 's fine as long as you 're all right . 
Well , you know , these flowers ... 
What do they mean ? 
Well , this must be a delivery mistake . 
I see . Okay . Have a good day . 
Thanks . 
Did you want to see me ? 
Did you think this kind of move would work on her ? 
( Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers . ) 
Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers . 
From Kim Sa Ra . 
Gosh . This is embarrassing . 
Are you naive or foolish ? 
You 're the perfect prey for that audacious witch . 
Mom . 
Is there anything more important to us than getting the law ... passed about law schools to build Chayul Town ? 
( Successful Strategy for Law School Law and Chayul Town ) 
( Current Status ) 
( Expected votes with Kim Young A 's support ) 
The person Kim Young A trusts and wants the most ... is Kim Sa Ra . 
Why do you want to use Kim Sa Ra to get Kim Young A 's support ? 
You must get her on board by finding dirt on her to put pressure . 
I tried to take that path , but it didn 't work . 
Then I must take a different path . 
And that path is Kim Sa Ra ? 
You know what ? Don 't even try to do anything . I 'll get it done . 
Do you think I 'm doing this just to get her support ? 
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun. These two ... started to investigate Na Yu Mi 's case again . 
That 's good . 
You don 't have anything to do with Na Yu Mi 's case anyway . 
This is good ? 
Do you truly mean that ? 
What are you getting at ? 
Anyway , I 'm the one who started the Chayul Town project . So I 'll see it through . 
Let me handle it . 
Hey , as for the things I told you to prepare for today , bring the most luxurious and expensive ones . 
Yes , sir . 
Bom . What are all these ? 
They 're for the first memorial service for Ms. Kim 's mother . 
She said she was going to do it alone . 
Wait . You 're going to load them into the car , right ? 
Gosh . Lawyer Dong . 
- What brings you here ? - I 'm coming in . 
Where should I put this box ? 
That box ? Put it on the chair . 
Thank you . 
Lawyer Dong said he had 15 years of holding memorial services . 
Oh , right . That 's the path her mother would enter from . We must leave the door open . 
I doubt that she knows the passcode . 
I see . 
First of all ... Red food goes on the east side , and white food , on the west side . 
What about the order of dates , chestnuts , pears , and persimmons ? 
( Table setting for memorial service ) 
What ? The order ? 
What was the order ? 
Are you taking an exam on the table setting ? 
When I do something , I tend to do my best . 
As for the placement of the food ... and the order of the nuts and fruits , they aren 't even recorded in documents . 
What was your mother 's favorite food ? 
It was mung bean jeon . 
Give me that then . 
Here . 
- All right . - What else ? 
After that , 
- give me the seasoned vegetables . - The seasoned vegetables . 
The seasoned vegetables . 
Put the vegetables on the ceremonial plate . 
When you 're able to free up your mind , come back whenever you want . 
I 'll be right here . 
Okay . 
Ms. Kim . 
Let 's get to work . 
- What should I do ? - You can get to work . 
Hurry up . Come on . 
Go on . 
You got the expensive ones , right ? 
Yes , sir . I bought the highest-quality ones . 
Did Dae Gi get off work ? 
He 's probably investigating Na Yu Mi 's case . 
Yes . I asked him for his help . 
I asked him to go over Na Yu Mi 's whereabouts ... on the day of her death from start to finish . 
If Noh Yul Seong isn 't the culprit , who could it be then ? 
We must find the witness , but it won 't be easy . 
Gosh . It 's so heavy . 
I 'm not late . 
It 's your mother 's memorial service today . 
I brought something for the service too . 
What are you doing ? 
Isn 't it obvious ? 
She 's Seo Yun 's grandmother . 
Who 's going to take care of her memorial service if not me ? 
Do you think my mother will want to eat the food you brought ? 
Take it back as you leave . 
Sa Ra . 
Can 't we ... act like adults now ? 
Didn 't you hear what she said ? 
- She told you to leave . - What are you doing here ? 
Can you help me ? I want to throw all of them out . 
This is awkward . 
Okay , fine . 
I 'll bring Seo Yun next time we meet . 
See you then . I 'll get going now . 
Bye . 
Bye . 
The flowers and the food for the memorial service . 
What are you getting at ? 
Oh , you ... I guess she hasn 't told you yet . 
Go upstairs , and hear it from her . It will be fun news . 
Let 's go . 
The witness ... 
What happened to the girl you mentioned before ? 
On the day of Na Yu Mi 's death , a part-timer came into the room . Remember her ? 
Oh , her . I 've been watching her . She 's been quiet so far . 
She might not have anything to do with that . 
Keep checking . So they don 't get their hands on her . 
Yes , sir . 
You won 't tell me what 's going on ? 
He must want to use me to be on good terms with Ms. Kim Young A. 
He 's suddenly acting friendly . 
Gosh . Seriously . 
I wonder how any facial hair comes out through his skin , given his skin is thick like iron . 
Don 't mind him . 
I 'm reminded of the bean soup your mother used to make . 
- It was the best . - It was really good . 
I had only heard about her . 
I had never met her in person either . 
Thank you . 
This is my mother . 
I see . 
Have I met your mother before ? 
No , I doubt it . 
But why does she look so familiar ? 
Wait . 
Can you watch this with us , Bom ? 
This lady right here . Doesn 't she look like her mother ? 
Mom ! 
Isn 't that my mom ? 
She does look like your mom . 
Right . Then listen to this . 
Can you repeat that ? What did you watch ? 
But my daughter was sent to prison ... 
- for something she didn 't do . - Mom . If I tell you about the video , can you help my daughter ? 
Is this your mother 's voice ? 
Yes . Why don 't we talk in person ? 
- It 's her voice . - I 'll go to your office . 
I can just go to the Southwestern District ... 
- Prosecutors ' Office , right ? - What 's all this ? 
She was an informant for Na Yu Mi 's case . 
But before that , can you give me your number ? 
My mother was the informant for Na Yu Mi 's case ? 
Then her daughter who went to prison ... 
Hold on . 
The date ... 
It was exactly a year ago from today . 
Keep watching this video . 
Right here . 
Can you recognize this man here ? 
No . 
Your mother came to the prosecutors ' office to make a report . 
All of a sudden , she followed an unidentified man . 
- That 's the day ... - I don 't believe this . 
I mean ... This makes no sense . 
Does this mean my mother didn 't commit suicide ? 
Wait . It 's too soon to say so . We don 't have any proof that she was murdered . 
He 's right . She was too kind for anyone ... to hold grudges against her . But my mother saw something . 
My mother was the witness for Na Yu Mi 's case . 
No . Don 't jump to conclusions . 
If you do , you 'll get farther away from the truth . 
Thank you for today . 
Get home safely . 
Stay strong . 
This is just the beginning . 
Noh Yul Seong . 
The anonymous man . 
Are the two of them related ... or not ? 
Are they ? 
This must be it . 
This one . 
( The best tteokbokki in Seoul ! ) 
( Danmuji and kimchi self-served ) 
Coming right up . 
They 're here . We 're over here . 
Here . 
What were you up to ? 
We 'll have one set here . 
Got it . 
Here 's the set . 
- Here . - Thank you . It looks great . 
It looks good . 
- Let 's eat . - Thank you . 
- Let 's eat . - It looks so good . 
( The best tteokbokki in Seoul ! ) 
The prison officer 's daughter , right ? 
Yes . Hello . 
It doesn 't seem like someone from this area . 
Has she said she was going to report someone ? 
No . 
When was the last time you saw my mother ? 
It was two days before she passed away . 
I scolded her for grilling meat for the part-timer . 
I told her taking too much care of the part-timer ... would make the other restaurants look bad . 
Was there a part-timer ? 
She always called her , " So Hee , " and took great care of her . 
She said the girl reminded her of her daughter . 
Do you have her number ? 
No . I only knew she was a student of the school in front . 
Oh , right . 
Here she is . 
She brought her when we were eating together . 
Right . Her last name was Bae . Bae So Hee . 
- Bae So Hee ? - Bae So Hee ? 
Open up , So Hee . 
Did you think I would not know about you meeting another guy ? 
Open up ! 
Open up , Bae So Hee ! 
Hello ? 
Please stop . 
Don 't you know how much I love you ? 
You 're all I have . 
I 'll call the cops . Leave now . 
One , two ... 
Darn it ! If you call the cops again , 
- it won 't end with just your ribs . - I want to report a stalker . 
Gosh ! 
Hey , be ready for me . 
Ms. Bae So Hee . 
Is Ms. Bae So Hee here ? 
Ms. Bae So Hee ? 
Please open the door , Ms. Bae So Hee . 
Ms. Bae So Hee ? 
Ms. Bae So Hee ! Just a moment ! 
Who are you to come out from there ? 
Hold on ! 
I apologize , sir . 
Are you still going to say that part-timer isn 't related ? 
You said she got away as soon as she saw you . 
She might have run away because of that stalker . 
I apologize , sir . 
But if he 's a stalker , he must be an expert at finding girls . 
Well , yes . 
Call that guy . 
We have to use everything we can . 
Understood . 
I told you I lost contact with all of my exes . 
The reason I reached out a friend 's friend of my ex ... was because of you . 
I 'm sure there will be at least one . 
Someone who is still in touch with the disappeared Bae So Hee . 
Did you think I wouldn 't find you ... if you move and switch jobs ? 
Excuse me . 
What are you doing ? 
Ms. Bae So Hee ? 
Is it you ? You crazy lawyer punk . 
What are you doing ? 
- Ms. Bae So Hee ! - Bae So Hee ! 
Ms. Bae So Hee ? 
So the prison officer 's daughter is ... 
Yes , it 's me . 
But why did you run away ? 
Who did you think I was ? 
Are you being chased ? 
I 'm sorry . I don 't want to be involved in more . 
What is that ? 
What don 't you want to be involved in ? 
You know what my mom had gone through ... before she died , right ? 
Ms. Bae So Hee ! 
Ms. Bae So Hee ! 
Ms. Bae So Hee ! 
Darn it ! 
Who 's that guy ? 
Bae So Hee 's stalker . 
He went mad even during the investigation . 
He went half mad . 
He looks like a dangerous one . 
Then So Hee should have asked for our help . 
Why ? What did she say ? 
She didn 't want to get involved . 
It seemed like she knew about my mother 's case . 
Will you give me your phone for just a moment ? 
- My phone ? - Yes . 
Why ? 
All right . 
- What are you doing ? - Just a moment . 
Whenever you miss your mom ... 
Just a moment . 
( Mom , Daughter ) 
It 's your mom 's new phone . 
Whenever you miss your mom , dial number one ... and tell her everything you want . 
Whenever you feel steam coming up from your head , call you mom and cool down . 
I 'll wait for Kim Sa Ra 's head to cool down . 
( Mom ) ( Daughter ) 
The call cannot be connected . Please leave a message after the tone . 
You will be charged . 
Mom . 
What happened that day ? 
I will make sure ... to find out . 
Thanks . 
My head has cooled down a bit , thanks to you . 
Call me when you feel down . 
( Dong Gi Jun ) 
I will go to you any time . 
The stalker boyfriend feels more suspicion . 
It has to be conviction more than suspicion . 
That will make him go wilder . 
Understood . 
( We won 't let you get involved . Please contact us . ) ( That stalker is dangerous . Please get our help . ) 
( Bae So Hee ) 
( Please help my mom . ) Please help my mom . 
Please . 
( Please ) 
I will meet you in an hour . Send me your address . 
Bae So Hee will come to us . 
Is she done with her hiding ? 
( Divorce Specialist SOLUTION ) 
She was ... very good to me . 
But why did you run away that day ? 
I was afraid . 
What were you afraid of ? 
( Noh Yul Seong and Han Ji In ) 
( The day of Na Yu Mi 's death ) 
After getting off work at the tteokbokki place , I went to my next part-time job . 
That was the start . 
I went to set up the room for the guests . 
That was when I saw a suite room for the first time . 
I got a bit excited . 
A family member of the deceased Ms. Na ... continued to request for a reinvestigation through a protest . 
I got so surprised after hearing the news . 
Investigation continues ... 
What 's wrong ? 
Do you know that person ? 
The woman that died ... didn 't commit suicide . 
Stop the party before I reveal these photos ... to your fiance . 
When did you take these ? 
Gosh . It 's a nice photo . 
Yu Mi . 
My marriage isn 't the world you think it is . 
And these won 't be enough to stop it . 
- Is that so ? - Yes . 
Then how about the story with you and the five-member society ... offering bribes here and there . 
Will that stop the marriage ? 
Are you insane ? 
Hey . 
The important part is in the back . 
Get all of the photos and recordings ... from Na Yu Mi . 
If she gets into nonsense , take care of her . 
How far shall I take things ? 
Hey , there are so many ways to get rid of her . 
Why would you ask me that ? 
So she came to see me after that . 
My mom went to prosecution . 
Did you know about this ? 
Yes . 
Did she go on her own ? 
No . She went with me . 
Mrs. Park , I 'll go to the restroom real quick . 
Sure . 
( The day of Sa Ra 's mother , Park Jeong Suk 's death ) 
After coming back from the restroom , she wasn 't there . 
I looked around for her , and I saw her . 
( Prosecution Service ) 
Whose car was it ? 
Well ... 
It was the secretary of the son-in-law . 
- Right . - The guy in the hotel footage . 
Noh Yul Seong ... 
Was the son-in-law not around ? 
Someone was next to her . But I couldn 't see the face clearly . 
So the hotel footage was all deleted , right ? 
Yes . 
Please testify to the police everything you just said . 
Will that make a difference ? 
You 're the only hope I have . 
First of all , leave the place you 're staying right now ... before the stalker comes for you again . 
Right . Let 's do that . 
We 'll find a safe place . 
Here . 
Great work . 
I thought I would get an apology . But it 's an envelope instead . 
I guess this isn 't too bad . 
You can stop now . 
So it ends as a termination of contract ? 
If that 's so , I 'll choose the gift for resignation . 
Put me in as a candidate too . 
- A candidate for what ? - As a daughter-in-law . 
I heard the chairwoman was really looking for one . 
My gosh . 
Don 't say that elsewhere . 
Someone might think it 's true . 
Do I sound like I 'm joking ? 
- Are you getting off work ? 
- Yes . - Let 's go . - Hello , Chairwoman Cha . 
Who is this ? 
She 's a client . 
I 'll see you again . 
I 'm dating CEO Noh . 
Was it Jang Hui Jin ? 
Yes . That 's right . 
Enjoy dating him . 
He can date whoever he wants . 
( Gositel ) ( 3-da-gil 6 , Tongin-ro ) 
Darn it . 
So Hee decided to go to the police . Let 's go . 
This will do . 
Let 's go and get Noh Yul Seong now . 
Am I a ghost ? Why are you scared ? 
Were you calling someone you were not supposed to ? 
What 's wrong with you ? 
You 're caught . 
A lawyer . 
I 'm calling because of work . 
Did he buy you this ? 
Yes ? 
I had it before . 
What did you do for those shoes ? 
You two have gone mad . 
( Lawyer ) 
I 'll explain everything . 
I 'll explain everything . 
Let me go . 
Hey , did you sleep with him ? 
Let it go . 
They said she just went out , but she 's not answering the phone . 
Where did she go ? 
I 'll try to call her again . 
The phone is turned off . 
Please leave ... a message after the tone . 
For goodness ' sake . 
Hey , So Hee . 
( Lawyer ) 
( Lawyer ) 
Is there no other data left by the part-timer ? 
I checked everything . 
Good . It 's clear . 
But she returned your flowers again . 
Don 't report something like that . 
Kim Young A got selected as the party representative now . 
For goodness ' sake . This is annoying . 
Deliver the flowers . 
To SOLUTION ? 
Send it to the presidential candidate for the next election ... under both my name and Sa Ra 's . 
Send new flower boxes to SOLUTION . 
Okay . 
Don 't think about anything today ... and just sleep well . 
Goodbye . 
Her birthday ? 
Phone number ? 
Sa Ra ! 
Sa Ra ! Kim Sa Ra ! 
Sa Ra , are you okay ? 
You 're fine . Relax . 
Breathe . Breathe slowly . 
Breathe out . 
Breathe in . You 're fine . 
Did you get to your senses ? 
How 's your breathing ? 
How much did you cry to experience hyperventilation ? 
What would we do without Bae So Hee ? 
We should look for another way . 
It 's so unfair for my mom . 
Stay strong . 
To prove whether So Hee 's words are true , it could become a messy fight . 
Oh , wait . 
Here . 
Thank you . 
But how did you come in ? 
Well , I keyed in my birthday , 1214 . It 's something I used before . 
It 's safe since no one will know . 
Yes , only one person can think of it . 
There 's no meaning to it . 
Of course . 
I 'll see you leave . 
I have a bad headache . 
Never mind . I 'll leave . 
The chess piece , which is our memory , is still here because it 's too much trouble to throw away , and the fact that the entrance passcode is my birthday ... doesn 't mean anything either . 
We held hands in the hospital room , but you didn 't fall for me . 
I 'm fine with everything , so I 'll wait . 
But it 's too hard for you ... to suffer alone during this time . 
Oh , you 're here . 
Why didn 't you rest more ? 
I 'm okay . 
Thanks for yesterday . 
Sure . 
I 'm going to meet Na Yu Mi 's taxi driver . 
We need to solve that case ... in order to find clues related to your mother 's case . 
I seem ... to be a star sign that constantly feels sorry toward you . 
Don 't be sorry to me . 
Then I 'd need to understand you again . 
Wait . 
Yesterday , I was ... too emotional . 
Are you not today ? 
I liked you being emotional . 
Yes , I liked it . 
I 'll go to see him . 
So I won 't feel sorry anymore . 
Oh , hello . 
- Hey . - Among the drivers , is there anyone named Gong Deukgu ? 
Oh . Mr. Gong ? He resigned a long time ago . 
Where will he be working now ? 
I think he 's hired as a driver for a company . 
Thank you . 
Is anyone home ? 
Is anyone there ? 
Mr. Gong Deukgu . 
A driver who wears designer shoes that are worth 9,000 dollars . 
( Gong Deukgu ) 
Get in . I have something to tell you . 
What are you doing ? Go to the passenger 's seat . 
( Prime Minister ) 
( Congratulations on your election ) It 's difficult for me to resign from SOLUTION . 
But if you can appoint me as a freelance Advisory Committee , I 'll do my best to assist you . 
It 's nice of you not to harshly refuse my offer . 
I 'm sorry , but I have one condition . 
Right in my face ? 
Let 's hear what the scenario is this time . 
Oh , Mr. Noh sent me a flower with your names on it . 
( Noh Yul Seong and Kim Sa Ra ) 
( Hanjoo Party ) 
I 'll tell you my scenario . 
( Messenger Service ) 
- Here you go . - Yes . 
- Have a nice day . - Thanks . 
It 's him again . 
Maybe it 's not a mistake . 
I 'll take care of it . 
It 's okay . 
Put it on the table . 
It 's nice to have some flowers in the office . 
Since I 'm a bit distracted with my mom , please make sure the client list is organized by the two of you . 
Okay . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
I 'll just take them . 
Noh Yul Seong sent them . 
He wants to marry me again . 
Who ? Noh Yul Seong ? 
So ? 
I 'm going to ... go back to his house . 
( Queen of Divorce ) 
Stop it now . Don 't mess with Sa Ra . 
I don 't think about anything impossible . 
I only think about something possible . 
What 's the end of this remarriage ? 
I 'm creating a solution for me this time . 
The solution code is Kim Sa Ra . 
You 're such an idiot . 
I told you many times not to trust anyone . 
That 's why you 're a failure . 
Then why do you trust Gong Deukgu ? 
Is he the right person ? 
Was he Na Yu Mi 's taxi driver ? 
Is he the one who took my mom too ? 
I think I saw those shoes before . 
I 've kept my secret until now . 
I 'm looking for this man . 
Isn 't he Gong Deukgu ?
