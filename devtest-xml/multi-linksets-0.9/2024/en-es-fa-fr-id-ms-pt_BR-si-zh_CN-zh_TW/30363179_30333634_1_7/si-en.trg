( Queen of Divorce ) 
Don 't you really know ... why I joined SOLUTION ? 
Don 't get distracted , Sa Ra . 
Fine . 
Then you shouldn 't get distracted too . 
Let 's just go . 
( Divorce Specialist SOLUTION ) 
You ... used me first . 
What did you want to show to Noh Yul Seong ? 
I must make him more anxious ... if I want to find out why he 's so bothered by us . 
I never used you . 
You could have had your pick of the job . 
But I was curious why you chose this place of all the offers . 
That 's true . 
Despite that , I chose to join SOLUTION . 
- I didn 't know ... that reason was Noh Yul Seong . 
You found out about the five-member society while working here . 
So working here paid off , did it not ? 
Kim Sa Ra . 
Is that ... all I amount to in your eyes ? 
I need you to take a break from the team . 
I finally understand why you wanted me to give you ... three months . 
Kim Sa Ra ! 
Hey , get a grip . 
Let me tell you something . That jerk is a total nutcase . 
Remember the case where a professor jumped off ? He 's using you , so he can find evidence to avoid taking responsibility for it . 
What 's so awful about being used ? 
I wouldn 't mind being used by him . 
How 's Chayul Town going ? 
I get that you 're curious about how much we know . But don 't make it so obvious . 
It makes you look small . 
I never used you . 
( Episode 7 ) 
Noh Yul Seong 's weak spot ... ( Noh Yul Seong , Seo Woong Jin ) Professor Seo . 
Come in . 
It 's about the law-school-related law . 
The Legislation and Judiciary Committee passed it . 
Could they have bribed the committee ? 
Only the plenary session remains now . 
- How likely is it to get passed ? - Assemblymen 's opinions are split . 
That must be why Noh Yul Seong is trying badly to grease ... the leaders of Hanjoo Party . 
So he 'll use the votes of the majority party ? 
Kim Young A , the party representative of Hanjoo Party ? 
Didn 't you say you guys have the same spa membership ? 
We do . Why do you ask ? 
I must stop Noh Yul Seong from turning into a dinosaur . 
I still can 't see my son when he 's only an elephant now . 
Should I find out when she comes for spa ? 
Only the members are allowed inside , right ? 
First of all , I need to cross paths with her at least once . 
You know , let 's fix your makeup , so you look a bit older . 
Pretend you 're me , and go in . Here you go . 
Thank you . 
It 's a VIP card . 
Hello . 
I 'm a fan . 
Thank you . 
Please run for President in the next election . 
- Sure . - By the way , aren 't you from the divorce ... 
Gosh , what an honour . You know who I am . 
My name is Kim Sa Ra . 
You destroyed Candidate Noh Yul Seong to pieces . 
Of course , I remember you . 
I always wanted to meet you someday . 
I got my wish , I guess . 
I 'll let you rest now . 
Do you also assist people ... in preventing a divorce ? 
Sang Hee . Is your campaign for class president going well ? 
Yes . 
How come you 're not even touching the tofu ? 
She activated her eyes on the back of her head again . 
I know you 're trying to lose weight . But if you don 't consume enough protein , your bones will break . Here . 
If I keep consuming protein like this , I 'll be a muscular pig . 
Sang Hoon . Have a good day at school . 
- Have a good day . - Thanks . 
Hey . 
- I need a moment . - I 'm running late . 
Just a moment . 
( Uncontested Divorce Agreement ) 
Must you do this now when you know I have a busy morning ? 
How many times must I tell you ? 
I was told that our family and politics don 't mix . 
It will bring a flood of misfortunes . 
Honey . How could you ... 
Are you doing this because you actually believe that ? 
What 's the harm in taking the advice ? 
Seriously . How come you can 't see it ? 
Get a grip . 
If that 's the reason , that 's all the more reason I cannot agree to this divorce . 
Honey . 
That 's the situation I am in . 
I was looking into setting up a meeting with you . 
I guess telepathy could be real . 
( The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation ) Thank you . 
Let 's hear it . 
Tell me why you came to see me at the spa . 
Where do you stand on increasing the number of law schools ? 
You really hate Mr. Noh Yul Seong , don 't you ? 
I can pay you the bonus after everything , right ? 
Yes . Of course . 
Let me say this again . 
My husband is asking me for a divorce . 
You wouldn 't want to go through a divorce , since getting reelected ... as the party representative would become harder then , right ? 
No . It 's because of my children . 
Sang Hee and Sang Hoon . 
They are from my husband 's previous marriage . 
I see . 
They may not be my biological children , but I can proudly say ... that I am their mother . 
In a divorce , it 'd be difficult for me to get custody , wouldn 't it ? 
Legally , yes . 
That 's why ... I cannot divorce him . 
You all read the message , right ? 
Isn 't this the first case where we have to stop a divorce ? 
I 'm all for this kind of case . 
We just kill at what we do . 
It doesn 't mean our job is to kill every divorce . 
Let 's gather all the materials and talk at the conference table . 
- Okay . - Okay . 
Hello . You 're here . Let 's start the briefing then . 
He 's going to sit this one out . 
What ? Why ? 
Is something wrong ? 
- Well ... - He has a lot of his own cases too . 
Let 's work on this one without him . 
But I still need to be in the loop regarding the overall outline . 
I 'll attend the briefing . 
Kim Young A , the party representative of Hanjoo Party . 
As an IT specialist , she was the CEO of a search engine in her 30s . 
Seven years ago , she married ... the CEO of Yerim Distribution , Yoo Min Chul , at a late age . 
Their conflict has gotten serious lately ... regarding her political career . 
As her husband 's company is about to get listed , he 's pushing for a divorce now . 
If he were to get a divorce after the company gets listed , there would be more assets to divide during the divorce . 
So he must want to get it done before that . 
When they got married , if she adopted his children , that would be grounds to demand child custody . 
Did she do that ? She must have missed that . 
Then they would be strangers if the divorce gets processed . 
Let 's meet with the husband first . 
- Security is our priority on this . - Yes , ma 'am . 
Are the bottoms of your feet okay ? 
You had crossed a desert . But there 's no water in your fortune . 
So what do you think ? The bottoms of your feet must be on fire . 
Life must have been tough on you . 
If you gather the energy of the universe together , the desert may turn into a meadow . 
Hallelujah . 
The pupils and whites of your eyes are clear . So you are bright . 
Your nose is straight like a riverbank where water flows . 
But your philtrum is deep . So you will drink up all the water . 
You and the energy of the universe ... are bound to be in conflict by nature . 
Hallelujah . 
Amen . 
Sir . Did you ask for a divorce ... based on the pastor 's fortune reading ? 
It 's not fortune reading . It 's the energy of the universe . 
I understand why this may seem a bit odd ... from the eyes of worldly beings . But do not be rude to him . 
Excuse me . We just met , but judging her based on her facial features is also bad manners . 
Why don 't you show them your psychokinesis ? 
They will need a reason to back out of the case too . 
Young lady . 
These coins are engraved with the 12 zodiac animals . Choose one . 
Then the pastor will make the coin of your choice fly in the air . 
You must experience his superpower to believe it . 
Why must I experience it ? 
It says so on your face . 
" How could you ask for a divorce based on what he said ? " 
Let 's stop here . 
There are people who doubt the truth of the universe . 
Please forgive their sin . Hallelujah . 
Amen . 
Anyway , Ms. Kim will not agree to a divorce ... unless you give her child custody . 
I will divorce her . 
Tell her to sign the paper quietly before this turns into a big deal . 
Hallelujah . 
Is this called the Magnet Religion ? 
How could he fall for a cult like that ? 
It will be harder for Ms. Kim to leave the children with him . 
It feels like we have two targets with this case . 
The husband and the pastor he is influenced by . 
Let 's dig into that pastor ... and find out about what kind of man he is . 
It will be a holiday soon . 
Hang in there , ma 'am . 
You didn 't get the cell phone back from Chayul Law Firm , right ? 
No . Not yet . 
You knew Chayul Law Firm had it . 
Professor Seo ... was in the five-member society Noh Yul Seong established . 
What 's that ? 
On the surface , they were working to found a law school . But they were a private group , looking to score future profits from real estate development . 
It is my opinion that ... the five-member society had something to do with why he jumped . 
Haven 't you done enough , putting him in this condition ? 
Are you going to accuse him of being a criminal now ? 
Please leave . 
Okay . 
Fine . 
You can curse me out and call me a prosecutor ... who only cared about making my case . 
Sometimes , it makes me wonder if that 's who I had been . 
That does cross my mind . 
But let me check Professor Seo 's cell phone . 
I will find the real reason behind his decision to jump . 
Well , you had me scared for some time now . 
I requested to meet with you for a while . 
But our meeting kept getting delayed . 
Once the law regarding law schools get amended , there would be three new law schools . 
I heard that your law firm played ... a huge role when it was presented to the LJC . 
( Hanjoo Party ) 
You want to get down to business . I see . 
This is great . 
If you help the law get passed in the plenary session , I will pay my own money ... to build the town for law schools . 
If these law schools can serve ... as a tool in revitalizing the regional economy , you will be taking all the credit . 
You can count on that , of course . 
Then it only makes sense that Chayul Law Firm takes ... one of the new law schools . 
That 's too bad . You see , I don 't join hands with people who have been ... awful to their spouses . 
By the way , there 's something between Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong . 
What ? That was so random . 
Seriously . You 're so clueless . This is why you can 't date men . 
Lawyer Dong never had the intention of sitting this one out . 
But Ms. Kim pushed him out on purpose . 
I bet she 's playing hard-to-get . 
You must think there 's a fling if two people establish eye contact . 
You think we 're all like you . 
My hunches are scientifically proven . 
See ? Our eyes meet all the time , but I never get confused . 
- Is that so ? - Yes . 
What ? 
What is it ? 
Gosh . I wonder if Lawyer Dong needs any help from another guy . 
He 's coming out . 
( Cheonji Dongsan ) 
They 're all his believers ? 
He must 've extorted a lot of money ... to be able to build such a big church like this . 
What is this ? A rip off on Cheonji Dongsan ? 
Let 's go . 
( Cheonji Dongsan ) 
His believers come here every week to be blessed ... by the pastor . 
To be blessed ? 
( Cheonji Dongsan , Pastor Cheonji , Cheon Ji San ) ( Cheonji Faith ) He 's known as the pastor ... who foresees the future and heals sick people . 
So people actually believe that ? 
( CEO Yoo Min Chul 's testimonial video ) 
Father . 
You know , he has psychic power . 
The psychic power we almost saw in person that day . 
Besides , he 's famous for making accurate predictions ... regarding investments . 
Back then , Yoo 's company was struggling due to lack of funds . But when he bought the stocks of the company the pastor pointed out , he made a fortune . 
He said his insomnia improved thanks to the psychic therapy . 
That 's how he got hooked . 
- What should we eat today ? - Let 's see . 
- You 're back , Lawyer Dong . - Hey . 
Well , why don 't you come and have a meal with us ? 
- Sure . - Okay . 
( Grilled beef restaurant ) 
I told you , didn 't I ? This restaurant is really good . 
Ms. Kim . Have this . It 's cooked . 
Hey , this is so tasty . 
- Really ? - Yes . 
Here . 
Are there people with psychic powers like him in Korea too ? 
The husband can 't think straight because Mr. Psychic Power said ... he would be in trouble without a divorce . 
I can make things float in the air too . 
- What ? - What ? 
- All right . - What ? 
It 's in the air ! 
Here . 
- Ms. Kim . Your hand , please . - What ? 
Quickly . 
Here . 
- Gosh . How did you do it ? - I 'm dizzy . 
It 's a magic trick . I can 't tell you the secret . 
Gosh . What ? How did you do it ? 
Are you curious ? 
- If you 're curious ... - Will you ask for 50 cents ? 
- Yes . - Don 't . 
Then how did the pastor treat his insomnia ? 
Maybe , it might be the placebo effect . 
Right . It got better as much as his faith grew . 
You 're still upset at me , But the magic trick must 've been fun . 
I think you 're more upset than me . 
You weren 't even interested in hearing me out . 
Have tea at my house before you go . 
At where ? 
Not ramyeon . Just some tea . 
You have to give me a chance to explain myself . 
Even if you 're going to shoo me away right after . 
Did you throw that away ? 
You were too lazy to throw this away , right ? 
Here . 
Thanks . 
I have something to show you . 
Here . 
( Seo Woong Jin 's Fatal Fall Incident ) 
Professor Seo was the last caller of the case of the assistant 's death . 
That assistant is Na Yu Mi ? 
Yes . 
But did Na Yu Mi and Noh Yul Seong know each other ? 
I 'd say it was more than just knowing each other . 
She was his girl ? 
Since when ? 
I 'm not sure . 
Anyway , I saw her in a hotel ... at Noh Yul Seong 's remarriage party . 
That night , she died after falling off a taxi that was driving . 
There was an informant ? 
The police ended the case as a suicide . But there was an informant that claimed it wasn 't a suicide . 
But why didn 't they conduct reinvestigation ? 
She couldn 't be reached after her call . 
It sounded like a lady in her 60s . But there were no clues that led to her . 
Seo Woong Jin 's death leap and Na Yu Mi 's suicide . 
Both cases don 't seem quite right . 
But in these two cases , Noh Yul Seong is involved . 
That was why I kept looking into these cases . 
But Noh Yul Seong wasn 't the reason I came to SOLUTION . 
It was Kim Sa Ra . 
We met after nine years . 
" Well , that 's nice . I should use my ex to my advantage . " 
Can you think that way ? 
Yes . 
What ? 
I will do that from now on . 
Do what ? 
I finally see a way to send Noh Yul Seong to prison . 
I want to use you , Lawyer Dong . 
Let 's use each other . 
Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong got in a fight . 
She sounded quite resolute about having Lawyer Dong out of a case . 
Really ? 
It seems like you 'll cry if they make up with each other . 
What 's going on ? Do you still have feelings for your ex-wife ? 
Don 't get ahead of yourself . 
Don 't be taking things there . 
Fine . 
Then is it too much to talk about Kim Young A ? 
I will if you stop frowning so much . 
Hurry up and tell me . 
She came to SOLUTION to ask for help to stop her divorce . 
Divorce ? 
Is she liable for anything ? 
Not at all . 
The problem lies within the husband . 
Amazingly , it has to do with a cult . 
- Get off . - What ? 
Weren 't you the one to call to ask me things ? 
You 're right about that . 
Get off for now . Wait for me . 
What 's with the heavy steps ? 
Sorry ? I 'm fine . 
Was it because I mentioned the second floor to stay out of it ? 
I hope it wasn 't because of that . 
Oh , not at all . 
It had nothing to do with you , Hui Jin . 
I was worried if you would get the wrong idea . 
Why are you worrying about me ? 
We 're in the same team . 
You 're going to push Kim Young A out ? 
It 's a mess there . 
No pesticide will work . 
If that 's the case , it 's best to cut it out . 
What next ? 
After her , the next representative is Ha Hyun Ho . 
I need your help . 
You said you 'll take care of things on your own . But you 're showing the white flag in just a week . 
I 'm feeling embarrassed . 
Your pesticides will surely work on Ha Hyun Ho . 
One last time ! 
If you are to blame me one more time , not even a single sheet of paper from Chayul will be given to you . 
If you are to help out with that , I will deal with Kim Young A. 
Hello , Pastor Cheon . 
By the way , you 're house is amazing . 
Oh , is CEO Yoo Min Chul 's divorce going smoothly ? 
Who are you ? 
Me ? 
I am someone who is looking in the same direction as you . 
Do you know Kim Young A well ? 
Yes . She comes often . 
She came for both the party representative ... and presidential elections . 
- Did you watch it ? - We 're watching it right now . 
Oh , right . 
Do you know Kim Young A well ? 
Yes . She comes often . 
She came for both the party representative ... and presidential elections . 
Are you her mentor ? 
That 's it . A mentor . 
The higher a person goes , the lonelier they get . 
Unexpectedly , she has no one around her . 
That is why I am here for her to give some advice . 
The part-timer of this place posted it up online . 
While going through the CCTV footage , talks about a big name made the part-timer post it up . 
Did your mom want steak this year ? 
Yes . I got the sign last night . 
- Enjoy your meal , Mom . - Let 's dig in . 
Only cooked vegetables . 
A controlled diet is most important for your illness , Sang Hoon . 
I know . 
What 's the point of going through a controlled diet ? 
Dad ... 
I know your dad doesn 't remember the anniversary of your mom 's death . 
Don 't feel too sad about it . 
He 's super annoying . 
Sang Hee , let 's not get rude now . 
Your brother might learn from you . 
Look at what he 's doing after hearing from a pastor ... that it 'll bring bad luck to him . 
Let 's eat . 
Hey . 
What ? 
That 's it . A mentor . 
This pastor is totally crazy . 
Mom , will you really get a divorce ? 
Gosh , are you kidding me ? 
Do you think I can live without you two ? 
Seriously ? 
I will survive through this . 
Don 't get so worried . Okay ? 
CEO Yoo ! 
What are you thinking ? 
I just don 't get why ... you said all those lies . 
Haven 't you heard of malicious editing ? 
It 's just making me look like I 've said those things . 
My gosh . 
So that was it , right ? 
Gosh . 
What do I get from doing that ? 
Your status will go up as a party representative mentor . 
Even if Kim Young A denies it , people will go with that idea . 
Listen . Kim Young A ... is taking away the cosmic energy within you . 
How many times have I told you this ? 
And yet , you 're still struggling ... to get a divorce . 
- CEO Yoo . 
- Yes ? Are you acting this way to avoid making offerings ? 
Pastor Cheon ! 
After our company gets listed , it 'll be Cheonji Dongsan 's . 
We must receive your great energy ... and spread out through the world . 
Hallelujah . 
Hello . 
Have you seen the video ? 
None of it is true . Talk with the secretary 's office . 
( Member of the Supreme Council , Ha Hyun Ho ) 
( Hanjoo Party ) I apologize for being late . Goodness . You 're going through a lot . 
Journalists love a bit of gossip , don 't they ? 
But let 's make things clear . 
Are you sure you 're not related to all that ? 
- Assemblyman Ha . - Well , if it isn 't true , you must deny this for the party 's sake . 
Don 't worry . 
I am not a member of that cult . 
Great . Then everything 's fine . 
Make some time on the weekend with your husband . Go to a big church or cathedral ... and post up a picture of you praying . 
That will sort things right away . 
I feel so dumbfounded . 
( The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation ) My husband says ... it 's malicious editing . 
Everyone on the Internet ... is doxing the pastor of Cheonji Dongsan . 
We can get by saying it 's nonsense from the pastor . 
But if everyone finds out that your husband is a member , things will get much worse . 
We don 't have time . 
The rumours and the divorce . 
These things will only get solved when your husband leaves that place . 
Just a moment . 
Me ? 
Again ? 
Out of us , you 're the only one the pastor doesn 't know . 
To get the husband out , we have to make him know the pastor is a cult leader . 
Why do you keep making me the inside man ? 
This still doesn 't sound right . 
Won 't there be another way ? 
If we are to make him learn that the pastor is a swindler , this is the best way . 
Well , I may be good at everything else , but acting is just not my thing . 
You won 't find a worse actor than me . 
It 's serious . 
Let 's find another way . 
Lawyer Dong . It 's a trend to have it all as a lawyer . 
Have it all ? I 'm not interested . 
If someone like me ends up going , everyone will find out . 
Hi ! 
Ms. Son . I don 't really look like someone who is ... part of a cult , do I ? 
There aren 't specific faces to be a cult member . 
What is it ? Why do you need me for this ? 
Ms. Son , you said you dreamed of becoming an actress , right ? 
Yes . I have the perfect face and body . What a waste . 
- Right ? - Yes . Why do you ask ? 
Why don 't you take this chance to live out your dream ? 
Two is better than one , isn 't it ? This looks great . 
What ? 
Just say no . 
What is it about ? 
Think carefully about this . Is this the best plan possible ? 
- Yes ! - Yes ! 
What plan ? 
Just say no . 
Say no ? No ! 
But what 's the plan ? 
( Cheonji Dongsan ) 
Cheonji claimed this ! 
If you have faith , the mountains and seas can be moved ! 
Believe in Cheonji ... and miracles will occur ! 
Doubt Cheonji ... and all will fall into the fiery pit ! 
Hallelujah ! 
- Hallelujah ! - Hallelujah ! 
- Amen . - Hallelujah . 
- Amen . - Amen . 
Claims that I am ... a mentor of a famous politician ... are not important at all . 
" Why so serious ? " 
Even so , there are numerous ... poor and pitiful members who have come ... from all over the country . 
Cheonji will welcome you with love . 
Newcomers . 
- Please stand up , newcomers . - Newcomers . - Yes . Stand up . - Please stand up for us . 
- Newcomers ? - We 're newcomers . 
- Up we go . - I can 't see at all . 
Who shall greet us as the representative ? 
Oh , the one with glasses . 
You 're the only man here . 
Glasses ? 
Oh , right . 
- Look natural . - Natural . Yes . 
Well , I have come with my sister ... who has lost her sight a few years ago ... through an unknown illness . 
We have come to receive the blessing of Pastor Cheonji . 
Hallelujah ! 
- Hallelujah ! - Hallelujah ! 
Great . 
None of that is necessary ! 
All you need is faith . 
- Faith alone . - This acting is more than terrible . 
With faith in Cheonji , the sister of the only man here ... a miracle will occur ! 
Hallelujah ! 
- Hallelujah ! - Hallelujah ! 
- Hallelujah ! - Hallelujah ! 
Amen ! 
- Amen ! - Amen ! 
Please be seated . 
Yes . 
Right . 
( Cheonji Dongsan ) 
Look forward . 
Cheonji ! 
Your faith ... will receive cosmic energy ! 
It is through Pastor Cheonji . 
Who ? 
- Pastor Cheonji ! - Pastor Cheonji ! 
Pastor Cheonji ! 
Through Pastor Cheonji , this poor cancer patient ... will receive that energy ! 
Do you believe this ? 
- Yes ! - Yes ! 
Do you believe this ? 
- Yes ! - Yes ! 
We believe ! 
Silence ! 
You may now ... witness the evidence of this miracle . 
This Pastor Cheonji has received cosmic energy ... to remove that lump of cancer . 
Thus , a miracle has come to this believer . 
- Amen ! - Amen ! 
Now , let us give our final prayer . 
I have an announcement to make . 
If you are a newcomer , please come to the front . 
Newcomers ! 
- You may leave the mats ... - Come forward . - this way . - Come this way . 
The mats ... 
Oh , right . Where is the prayer room ? 
- It 's that way . - Right . 
She can 't see . 
- My sister can 't see . - I can 't see . - It 's this way . - I can 't see . 
- I must go this way . - This way . 
- Don 't look surprised . - I can 't see . 
You can 't see . 
Thank you . 
- Ms. Son . - Yes ? 
You 're supposed to be blind . 
I 'll just keep my eyes closed . 
Keep them open and keep watch . 
All right . It is a bit scary here . 
Gosh . 
Oh , no . 
( Laundry Room ) 
Gosh , my back is killing me from standing . 
Staying healthy is the best thing . 
Someone just went past me . Someone just went by ! 
Darn it . I told them to get rid of the empty boxes . 
Let 's take a look . 
Let 's see . 
Okay . 
Sir , there 's another fuss in the lobby . 
Gosh . Why can 't they take care of it on their own ? 
- Let 's go . - All right . 
- Let 's go . - Where is it ? 
- It 's that way . - My back hurts . 
My back is killing me . Standing is all I can do . 
What do I do ? 
My goodness . 
Something must be wrong with my back . 
Okay . 
Gosh . What do I do ? 
- Did you get it ? - Come on . 
- Let 's get out of here . - Okay . 
We took too long . 
Give me back my wife ! 
- You can be like this here . - Calm down ? Drag him out . 
- Hey ! - Come this way . 
You made us get a divorce out of nowhere ! 
Hey ! Where 's the pastor ? 
Hey ! You cult members ! 
- Hey ! - This place is a mess . 
Stay focused . Use your cane . 
My goodness . 
They 're dragging him out . 
You 're totally not blind right now . 
That 's just awful . 
Stay focused until the end . 
Just a moment . 
Oh , yes . Hallelujah . 
- Right . - We 're heading out . 
Is that so ? Just a moment . 
What are you doing ? 
- Bang ! - Gosh ! What are you doing ? 
- You can see , right ? - Yes , I can ! Hey ! What are you doing ? 
What do you mean you can see ? Why are being so rude like this ? 
Let 's get ... 
My goodness . 
What should I do ? My goodness ! 
Hey ! Go away ! 
- I saw a miracle . - Get out ! - Pastor , it 's a miracle ! - Go away ! 
Hey ! Go away ! 
Bring them to me . They are swindlers . 
Get off of me ! 
- Let me go ! - Wait a minute . 
- Wait a minute ! - Oh , my ! 
- No ! - I 'm sorry ! 
Seriously . 
You bad people ! 
- Go away ! - Gosh . 
- My goodness . - Oh , my . 
- Hey ! - Stop . 
- Hey ! No ! - Oh , my . 
You bad people ! 
Chase them , now . 
Seriously . 
- Hey ! - Hurry up ! 
- Calm down . - My goodness . 
- Get in . - Drive ! 
My goodness ! 
Seriously . 
My goodness . 
But you ... were running away without me . 
- Are you okay ? - Yes , I had so much fun . 
Who said you were a bad actor , Lawyer Dong ? You should change your career as an actor if you get fired . 
Look . I told you ... this isn 't a good idea . 
It may not be good , but it was the best . 
- Was it ? - Yes . 
It hurts . 
( Yerim Distribution ) 
It 's a scam disguised as psychic abilities . 
Pastor Cheonji is a cult leader . 
Let 's stop . 
Did my wife ask you to do this ? 
To fabricate the video ... and make me change my heart ? 
Let 's at least reveal the truth . 
Ask Pastor Cheonji to hold a press conference . 
" I 'm not Kim Young A 's a mentor . " 
( CEO Yoo Min Chul ) He 's not someone whom I can ask to do this or that . 
Then , let 's upload this video on the Internet ... and ask the public . 
If they think if it 's fabricated or not . 
Then , my wife would be affected too . 
Our goal is to prevent a divorce , not to maintain her approval ratings . 
I doubt a company rumoured to have its CEO enchanted by a cult ... must be listed well in the stock market . 
I 'll give you time to think until tomorrow . 
Are you asking me to help Ms. Kim Young A ? 
Am I right ? 
You should 've seen the video . 
It 's filmed it in a way that could easily be misunderstood . 
We can keep the cult members quiet . 
Why are you making a fuss ? 
( Cheonji Dongsan ) It 's because we 're getting listed in the stock market soon . 
If our company gets listed at a high price , it 'll be better for Cheonji Dongsan too . 
Please make an exception just this once . 
( Professor Seo 's wife ) 
( Hello . This is Dong Gi Jun. If you can 't believe me , ) 
( check his bank account . A record for the five-member society ... ) 
You need to pay the hospital bills for this month ... to extend the hospitalization . 
Our financial situation is not good due to the long hospitalization . 
Please wait until next week . 
Have you not received Professor Seo 's phone yet ? 
Because of the recent case I 've taken on , I 've been pondering about what trust really is . 
It feels like the most secure prison in the world . 
You can 't escape ... until you realize it . 
What are you trying to say ? 
Professor Seo ... must 've invested in the five-member society ... that Noh Yul Seong created . 
That 's how he became one of the members . 
If he invested , then what ? 
You should think carefully why Noh Yul Seong ... kept quiet . 
I 'll wait until ... you start doubting ... Chayul Law Firm . 
You saw what happened today and yesterday , right ? 
Playing games is over for them . The end ! 
When did they even start ? 
I should give you a lesson about love . 
Where 's Kwon Dae Gi ? 
It 's a misunderstanding . 
- It 's not his name too . - Is it you ? 
Kwon Dae Gi ? Or Geon Dae Gi ? 
- Who is he ? - You jerk ! 
How dare you seduce my wife ? 
- You little ... - Seriously , stop ! 
- Who are you ? - He is flirty , but he won 't date a married woman . 
Tell him . 
He didn 't know . 
Honey ? 
For real . I didn 't know . 
Let me give you a good punch . You jerk ! 
How dare you seduce my wife ? 
- It 's her fault ! - Please ! - Come here ! - Sir ! 
- For goodness ' sake ! - Honey , calm down ! 
Put this on . 
It 's camomile tea . It 'll make you calmer . 
This can 't be true . She was married . 
Thanks , anyway . 
I 'm touched ... that you trusted me . 
I won 't tell anyone so don 't worry . 
Love freely , but let 's be cautious . 
What ? 
You 're not my type ! 
Pull yourself together . 
I saw your weird eyes today . 
Every time you date someone , ask for a family relationship certificate . 
Or let me give you a lesson about love . 
( CEO Noh Yul Seong ) 
What are you doing ? 
Kim Young A isn 't a member of my church . 
The video is fabricated . 
I 'll sue the person who distributed this video . 
Is there ... anything wrong about my interview ? 
Who gave you the permission to have an interview like that ? 
You didn 't even discuss with me . 
Who do you think you are ? 
- " You ? " - I have ... nothing to gain from you . 
Let 's walk separate ways . Okay ? 
Look at this scum . 
Come in . 
- You know Ha Hyun Ho , right ? - Yes . Set an appointment . I want to meet him in person . 
Okay . 
( SEOHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ) 
I checked my husband 's bank account . 
He transferred one million dollars to a company named Five-member . 
You had no idea . 
I got this back from Chayul Law Firm . 
( Call log ) 
It has gone through factory reset . 
They told me it was a mistake ... while trying to decode it . 
It doesn 't seem like a mistake now . 
Deleting and recovering data is a skill fight . 
If I 'm more skillful than the person who deleted it , I can recover the data . 
Is that so ? 
And you recovered it ? 
My goodness . 
- Dae Gi . - Oh , my . 
Thank you so much , Dae Gi . 
I 'll give you my bonus paycheck . 
Thank you . 
Take your time looking at the data . 
I 'll get going while thinking about the bonus . 
- Okay . - Thank you . 
- Thank you , Dae Gi . - Sure . 
You 're right . The last person who called him was Noh Yul Seong . 
The number ending with 2711 . 
Wait . 
November 10 , 4am . 
It 's right before his suicide . 
CEO Noh , please give me back one million dollars that I invested . 
It 's urgent . 
( CEO Noh ) 
( CEO Noh ) 
I can 't call . I need it immediately . 
I 'll send you my bank account number . 
Professor Seo is under investigation by the prosecutors . 
What 's Na Yu Mi 's case ? 
He 's a witness . 
Where are you ? 
At my school . 
Answer my call . 
( CEO Noh ) 
What was automatically recorded on his phone has been restored . 
( Call recording : CEO Noh ) 
Hello . 
Are you trying to come clean in front of the prosecutors ... after you withdraw your investments ? 
You 're a witness . 
Why are you scared ? 
The prosecutors requested a search and seizure warrant . 
It 'll be ready in an hour . 
I have recordings on my phone . Regarding change of purpose and bribery . 
You 're mad . 
( Professor Seo ) Pull me out of this . 
Just withdraw my money . 
I 'm not like you . 
That 's my entire savings . 
What is he talking about ? 
Professor Seo wants to come clean . What shall we do ? 
To who ? 
- To the prosecutors . - What ? 
What a nut job . Are you crazy ? 
Who 's against taking Professor Seo out of our group ? 
Between us , betrayal means death . 
From now on , you will die alone . 
CEO Noh . 
( CEO Noh ) 
In 30 minutes , your wife , daughter , and mother will all see this video . 
So escape , or die . Choose one . 
( Call recording : CEO Noh ) 
( SMS history ) 
He was in full acceleration mode . 
I didn 't think he 'd go to that extent . 
Let 's go together . 
We should step on the brake for him . 
Why are you here ? 
Oh , I just missed you . 
What are you talking about ? 
Here . 
These are Professor Seo 's phone and forensic files . 
Oh , yes . 
It 's the evidence to prove ... that Noh Yul Seong made Seo Woong Jin commit suicide . 
CEO Noh did that to Professor Seo ? 
There wasn 't much in Na Yu Mi 's case file . So I 'm digging his involvement in Professor Seo 's suicide first . 
That 's a good move . 
Jin Woo . Prosecutor Park . 
Please put Noh Yul Seong in jail ... and unload my anger . 
- All right . - Okay . - Goodbye . - Disciple of justice , - Prosecutor Park . - Yes . 
( Seo Woong Jin 's forensic files ) 
The phone too . 
Don 't worry about the casino entry records . 
We 'll cover it for you . 
It 's done . 
Good job . 
Make sure to clean up the forensic company , their office , and their houses ... so that there aren 't any copies . 
Okay . 
( Kim Sa Ra ) 
For goodness ' sake . 
Bom , do you know Sa Ra 's exact house address ? 
Please send it to me . 
Is everything okay ? 
I need to check something . Hurry . Okay . 
The phone is turned off . 
Please leave a message after the tone . 
You will be charged . 
Kim Sa Ra . 
Kim Sa Ra . 
Lawyer Dong . Open your eyes . Lawyer Dong ! 
Gi Jun ! 
( Queen of Divorce ) 
Let 's find the best solution for Ms. Kim . 
Noh Yul Seong is supporting Assemblyman Ha Hyun Ho . 
What can Kim Young A do now ? 
It 's like getting a death sentence in politics . 
I 'm making a difficult decision . 
I accept my husband 's request to divorce me . 
The solution for this round is a custody battle . 
Demolishing Cheonji . 
So we will ... be very detailed . 
I 've made a mistake worthy of death . 
Why did you when you can 't even die ? 
It 's not just me . Sa Ra , are you all right ? 
No , I 'm not .
