( JUDGE SPEAKS ENGLISH ) Order in the court ! 
Prosecutor , please continue . 
Let me ask you again . 
During the mission , did you or did you not see the defendant killing civilians ? 
Sir , I need your answer ! 
JIAN : ( SPEAKS KOREAN ) Why aren 't you answering it ? 
Who is it ? 
Sir , this is Juncheol . 
How did you get this number ? 
That 's not important right now . 
Bale is still alive . 
I can 't talk for long . He 's on his way to your mom 's funeral with Lee Seongjo . 
Please , answer your phone ! Come on ! 
What the hell ? 
I 'm so sorry , but my phone died . 
Can I borrow your phone ? I have to call the insurance company . 
Fuck ! 
MR. KIM : Turn off your light ! 
What the fuck ? 
How thrilling . 
Second floor , center ! 
Cease fire ! 
- SEONGJO : Mr. Kim , how 's it going ? - ( GUNSHOT ) 
Shit . 
Come in . Mr. Kim . 
- Can you hear me ? - ( TURNS OFF RADIO ) 
Hey , Mr. Kim ... 
What the hell ? 
Today 's not your lucky day . 
Attain enlightenment , buddy . 
What the fuck 's going on ? 
Are they all dead ? 
They can 't even take what 's handed to them . 
For God 's sake . 
What 's taking you guys so long ? 
Hurry up , will you ? 
Shoot the ceiling ! 
You should 've secured your visibility first in the dark , Mr. Kim . 
You 've finally lost your touch . 
Minhye . Someone like you is worth taking to hell with me . 
( SPEAKS KOREAN ) Oh ... Hi , Jeong Jian . 
I 'm Brother . 
Put that on your wrists . Put it on Bae Jeongmin . 
What ? 
How ... do you know me ? 
What ? 
MAN : I feel like I can spin it all night . 
These six have rented out the ride . 
You all must be rich . 
The girl with her eyes shut and the guy in the leather jacket . Are you related ? - Or a couple ? - Don 't worry . Hold onto me . MAN : What ? You 're holding hands ? 
Look at that . 
I can 't let that happen . Attack ! 
MAN : What 's this ? This isn 't right . 
You can 't sit there . 
- How will you explain this ? - Junmyeon . Don 't move . 
You 'll fall if you move again . 
MAN : By the way , this girl has the strongest legs I have ever seen ! 
Look at her hold on ! 
Thanks . 
I 'll be going , then . 
Jian . 
You 're going to leave like that ? 
What ? 
Is there something more to do before I go in ? 
You really don 't have a clue , do you ? 
PASIN : Your muffler has a hole . I 'll fix it for 50,000 won . 
This is my uncle . 
Oh ... Hello . 
Isn 't it illegal for a teenager to ride a motorcycle ? No helmet , illegal mods . 
Show me your license . 
PASIN : Come on , sir . 
You 're so old-fashioned . 
Let the kids be lovey-dovey . 
Jian , keep going . 
Still , I need to check . 
Show me your license . 
I ... I didn 't bring it with me today . 
I should go . 
Have a good night . 
PASIN : I 'll go with you . 
- I 'll call you ! - PASIN : 
Come here . 
JUNMYEON : Why are you getting on ? 
PASIN : Drop me off at the store . 
Did you see how he didn 't bow his head as he greeted me ? 
One bulgogi burger and two shrimp burgers . 
She 's been working here for a while . 
Didn 't you know ? She works two jobs . She works at the gimbap shop too . 
She still lives with her uncle ? 
It could be her uncle , lover , or pimp . Who knows ? 
Hey , it 's her uncle . 
- Okay . - So sensitive . - So sensitive . 
- I 'm not sensitive ! 
- You 're disgusting . - She 's always like this . 
Why ? 
Does she not have parents ? 
That 's right . You wouldn 't know . You transferred in middle school . 
Listen . 
Her mom and dad ... Stop . Do you want her to hit you 
- with a chair again ? - Wait ! My PTSD ! 
Enjoy your meal . 
BOY 1 : Minsook , don 't you hang out with her ? 
Let 's go somewhere else . - Why ? - MAN : What ? Why ? 
JUNMYEON : Go somewhere else . MAN : Why ? - What ? - JUNMYEON : Let 's go . Come on . 
MAN : What is it ? JUNMYEON : Just ... 
MAN : Do you know her ? 
JUNMYEON : She 's no one . 
( WOMAN ON TV ) They have confiscated 400 unauthorized guns , five crossbows , and 32 stun guns . 
If you are caught carrying or using weapons without a permit , you could be imprisoned for three to 15 years ... 
Why did you act that way to Minsook ? 
In middle school when Minsook came over . 
You came into my room , stared at her for ten minutes , and got misunderstood for a pervert . 
It lost me my only friend . 
Also , my tutor , Jinki . 
He was just messing around a little . You just had to threaten him to do his job properly and make him quit the next day . 
Listen up , Jian . 
First off , Minsook stole my watch that day . 
I only looked at her to confirm that . 
She apologized to me and returned my watch . That was the end of it . 
Second , your tutor , Kim Jinki ... 
Well , in the end , he was arrested for molestation a week later . 
As your legal guardian who must protect you , I think I did my best . 
Then , what about Junmyeon ? 
What did he do so wrong ? 
It 's illegal for a high schooler to ride a motorcycle . 
He had no helmet . 
He even smokes ! 
He reeked of it . 
Come on ! 
Uncle . Do you know why I work so many jobs ? 
I 'm saving up to move out of here . 
I 've thought about why I 'm so different from the other kids . 
I know you raised me , but ... why does it feel like you 're locking me up ? 
I know I 'm not a model student . But I 'm not a problem child either . 
Why do you meddle in everything ? 
I want to hang out with friends like the other kids . 
I want to date too . 
Am I not allowed ? 
Then , make a bet with me . 
My face . I 'll let you move out if you can hit it even once . 
I 'm being serious . 
So am I. 
Are you done eating ? 
I 'll put them away . 
Are you hiding something from me ? 
Mom and Dad ... Did they really die the way that everyone talks about ? 
Honestly , I don 't remember . 
Isn 't it time you told me ? 
Will you take the bet ? 
It took a lot for me to bring this up to you ! 
What 's wrong with you ? 
Why do you always avoid the subject ? 
Forget it if you don 't want to move out . 
You 're so slow . 
You do the dishes . 
You 're so annoying ! 
Turn right . 
There you go . 
Come on . 
Great job , Jian . 
Slowly . 
Bring it down . 
JIAN : Okay ! 
Wow , Jian ! 
You pass . 
You 've got a knack for it . 
Great job . 
Put the forklift back where it was and come eat . 
Move ! Move ! 
I said move ! 
Get out of my way ! 
What are you doing , Jian ? 
You 're scaring me ! 
Fighting with your family makes you a bitch . 
Stay out of it ! It 's a family matter , Pasin ! 
Did you just hit me ? 
You 're too slow . You 're like a slug . 
You won 't even touch his hair . ( SPEAKS ENGLISH ) Can 't touch . 
( SPEAKS KOREAN ) Why are you all on my case ? 
Let go of me ! 
Let go ! 
Let go of me ! 
Hey ! Let go ! 
Let ... 
JINMAN : You 're getting it all wrong . 
How do you get it wrong every time ? 
PASIN : You 're so annoying . Worry about yourself . 
I took it out ! 
JINMAN : Look . You got it wrong again . How do you keep getting the distance wrong ? 
PASIN : Stop nagging me . 
Did I ... pass out ? 
Jian is up . 
You must 've been tired . Don 't study so hard . 
Did I pass out ? 
How could you make your niece pass out ? 
- What ? 
- She 's right . 
I didn 't do it . He did . Right . What ? 
You 're shameless , Jinman . You told me to do it . 
When did I ? 
You 're such a liar . 
Fuck you ... Die ! 
You told me to do it . You made me . 
Unbelievable . When ? 
Put the forklift back where it was . 
( SPEAKS THAI ) What 's your hand ? 
Give me your head . 
MAN : You lose , you get hit . 
( SPEAKS KOREAN ) Bums . Pay first . 
Okay . 
Pasin , what you did to me earlier . Teach me how to do it . 
You want me to teach you Muay Thai so you can hit Jinman ? 
Yes . 
No . 
Yes , Master . 
Just creep up on him and hit him while he 's sleeping . 
But isn 't that cheating ? 
It seems too easy too . 
Do you think it 'd be easy ? 
I want to move out of my uncle 's place . 
He 's frustrating . I can 't live with him . 
The Muay Thai that I do is tough . 
You can 't do it . 
I can . 
I 'll do everything you tell me to do . 
Three times a week . 500,000 won a month . 
I 'm in high school . I don 't have that kind of money . 
Jian . I have to send my son to a private school next year . 
So I need a lot of money , but I don 't have any right now . 
I should just die . 
Even with my paychecks , the most I can get is 50,000 won a week . 
Deal . 
Follow me . 
( SPEAKS ENGLISH ) First lesson . 
( SPEAKS KOREAN ) We 're starting now ? 
Try to block me . 
One , two . - One , two . - Keep your elbows up . 
Always remember this box . 
Don 't lose balance . 
Jian ? 
You 're too stiff . 
You 're all talk . 
Barely breaks even . 
One , two . 
You 're a slug . 
- ( SCREAMS ) - Slug , you 're so slow ! 
Get up , Slug . 
Hello ! 
What are you doing ? 
- Put me down . - So slow , Slug . 
- Hey , hurry ... - Jian ? 
What the hell ? 
MAN 1 : You 're pretty . 
Who were those kids ? Your friends ? 
We 're better than them . 
MAN 2 : Did we scare you ? 
MAN 1 : You 're a pretty thing . 
- Hey , show us your face . - JIAN : Cha Minsook ? 
- Hey . - Jian ! 
- Hey ! - What the hell ? MAN 1 : What the fuck ? 
- MAN 2 : Damn . - Who the fuck are you ? 
You ruined everything ! 
What is that ? Green onions ? Is this a fucking joke ? 
This is good . I was hungry . I 'm craving ramyeon . 
Hey . She ran away , so you have to make up for it . 
Can you handle it ? 
Fuck . 
Who the fuck am I talking to ? 
What ? What 's that glare ? 
What is it ? What are you trying to do ? 
Damn . Are you a boxer or something ? 
What is it ? Do you want to play ? 
What the ... 
You must not be from around here . That 's enough . 
Listen up , Jian . 
I know you 've become stronger after learning to fight from Pasin , but it 's not enough to beat a man holding a knife . 
Just run away next time . 
Drop me off at Master Pasin 's place . 
MAN 1 : My money ! I need my 350,000 won to pay rent ! 
MAN 2 : I haven 't seen him for two or three days . 
- ( IN THAI ) He took 500,000 won from me . - MAN 3 : ( IN KOREAN ) Everyone , calm down . 
We 're checking everything now . - Just wait . - What 's going on ? 
Jian ! Pasin , that bastard ! 
He borrowed money and ran off . 
- What ? - Not just me ! Everyone here lent him money . 
What do we do ? We 're done for ! 
Is there a Jeong Jian here ? 
That 's me . 
PASIN : Jian , ( SPEAKS ENGLISH ) you 're not a slug anymore . 
JEONGMIN : ( SPEAKS KOREAN ) What is this ? 
Is that your school ? 
There 's one in the bathroom . 
You 're insane ! 
Who are you ? How long have you been watching me ? 
Who made all of this ? 
Was it my uncle ? 
It 's not the time for this , Jian . 
Minhye is out of bullets . 
More guys will come soon ! 
It won 't stop here . The boss said so ! 
Minhye can 't die if we want to stop them . 
We have to go out there and give her more bullets and medicine ! 
What the hell are you saying ? 
Wait ... That 's too bright ! 
That 's too bright ! It 's bright ! 
Xeroderma ... pigmentosum . Xeroderma pigmentosum ! 
If ... I ... If I 'm exposed to light ... for a long time , it hurts ! 
Turn off the lights ... 
Hurry ! Turn off the lights ! 
You haven 't answered me yet ! 
What is all of this ? 
How long have you been watching me from here ? 
You came to this house ... on June 26 , 2009 . 
I came to this house on June 20 , 2009 . 
In just ... 
We have to be careful . 
He 's pretending to be pitiful to evoke sympathy . 
I don 't know why he 's here , but it 's true he spied on you . 
I 'm going to try to figure out the shopping mall 's system . We 'll be able to get proper information on your uncle . 
What is this ? 
Why does a mere weapons shopping mall have a server room like this ? 
BROTHER : Jeong ... Jian ! 
Don 't trust him ! 
Hey , open this right now ! 
What do I do now ? 
No . 
Let me go . 
Get this off me , asshole . 
BROTHER : Jeong Jian ? 
Open the second drawer to your right . 
One . 
If the owner of murthehelp , Jeong Jinman , dies or is absent due to an accident , then Jeong Jinman 's niece , Jeong Jian , will inherit murthehelp . Two . After Jeong Jian inherits murthehelp , she will faithfully cooperate with the handover and carry out her duties such as accounting , management , and personnel tasks . 
Three ! During the handover , Jeong Jian is allowed to give up her inheritance . 
She 'll take responsibility after signing . Six . Whether the handover proceeds according to these regulations ... The necessary measures must be taken . 
Ten . As an employee of murthehelp , I promise to obey whatever the owner of murthehelp orders , no matter what . I also promise to risk my life if need be . 
I ... read it all . 
Now , tell me if you consent to take over murthehelp . 
Do you see a pen and paper in there ? 
The boss planned all of this . 
He expected that he would die and murthehelp would be attacked . 
Now , just follow my guide ... 
Let Jeongmin go . 
No . 
I ... can 't . 
You said you 'd risk your life and obey me . 
That 's what you said . 
Don 't you remember ? 
Let Jeongmin go ! 
Anything but ... Not that ... 
There 's a reason for this . 
What is it ? 
The boss ... died because of Bae Jeongmin . 
Jeongmin ! 
Stop it . 
What are you doing , Jian ? 
Do you ... Do you seriously believe him ? 
Shut up ! 
No . 
No , Jian . 
Jian . 
Think about it . 
I was with you when we almost died upstairs an hour ago . 
And a strange woman drugged me . 
Don 't you remember ? 
I helped build the hardware website . I helped with your uncle 's funeral ! But I 'm the one that made him die ? 
You probably erased the evidence during the funeral . 
Erased what ? 
I 'm the one that found his phone , and because of that all of this happened and I almost died . 
Jian . What about him ? 
How do we know why or when he came here ? 
He 's been here in the basement while you two lived upstairs ? 
Does that make sense ? 
Is he a parasite or what ? 
Jeong ... Jian . 
Don 't you think ... it 's strange ? 
Shut your mouth ! 
You 're a pervert who spied on Jian 's naked body ! 
No ! 
Your uncle ... would never commit suicide . 
Jian . 
- Jian , don 't listen to him ... - Wait ! 
I want to hear what he has to say . 
Of course . Sure , Jian . 
But ... But think carefully about it . 
This is ridiculous and so unfair . 
Keep going . 
He came to your uncle . Then , the boss died . 
If you 're curious , open the video file labeled " 0404 " on the main screen of the computer . 
You ... What are you up to ? 
Are you a hacker ? 
No ! 
No , don 't click it . 
The moment you click it , we don 't know what will happen . 
The doors here could be disarmed . And the killers might get in . 
Look at the facilities here , Jian . 
No . 
Just hurry up and click it . Watch it . 
He could 've controlled everything in here to kill us . 
No , no , no ! That 's not true ! 
He 's lying ! Just click it and watch the video ! 
Jian ... Wait , Jian ... 
Do you remember ? When you were locked in the school storage room , the person who told your uncle that you were there ... was me . 
Here . 
Here ! 
JINMAN : Listen up , Jian . 
Whatever you choose , I 'll leave it to you to decide . 
What will you do ? 
Do you want to raise it or take it to the shelter ? 
I want to raise it . 
I already gave it a name . 
Dooney . 
I 'm going to make sure Dooney lives . 
All right . Do that . 
However ... Listen up , Jian . 
Every choice you make comes with responsibilities . 
If Dooney gets sick and dies , you must take responsibility for your sadness too . 
You go . Go and give that woman guns and medicine . 
Okay . 
This ... is a gift . 
Can you hand me the beanie ? 
Oh , right . 
Do not , under any circumstances , come outside of the shopping mall . 
Promise ! 
Don 't . 
Who are you ? 
Minhye . It 's me . 
It 's been a long time . 
You 've grown a lot . 
Are you okay ? 
Jian . Thank you so much . 
Thank you so much for choosing me . 
Yes , sure ... 
But ... did you know ? 
When we were young , the person that locked you in ... was also me . 
What was that ? 
I got a dose of that earlier . 
It works pretty well . 
Dooney ... 
You ... Who are you ? 
How do you use this ? 
Does it have a button ? Is that it ? One , two , three . 
Damn ! 
You control it with that computer ?
