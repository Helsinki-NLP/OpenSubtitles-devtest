Checking . One , two .

This is the best weather to go fishing . Don 't you think ? 
A nice cool cup of makgeolli would hit the spot right now . 
Group 1 , Team 1 , Team 2 . 
The rabbit hunt is about to begin . 
Nine hundred and fifty meters to the rabbit . 
Shit . Why are they bitching from both sides ? It 's distracting . 
Jeong Jinman and his pathetic family portrait . 
You 've had your share of fun . You lying bastard . 
Focus . 
Listen up , Jian . 
That 's ridiculous . 
They can 't land a single shot from both sides ? 
No , no . 
The main character is using the blind spots really well to avoid the bullets . 
Yeah , right . The movie 's over if the main character dies . 
Jeong Jian . Tell me . In this very moment , do you think you can see everything perfectly ? 
Yes , of course . It 's right there . 
Why not ? 
Listen up , Jian . 
You 're not a dragonfly . 
You can 't see everything with the human eye . Don 't be mistaken . 
There are always blind spots . 
If you use those blind spots right like the guy in the movie does , you can even survive a fiery pit . 
Blind spots . 
Jian . What are you doing ? 
What the hell ? 
Oh , baby girl . 
You 've watched too many movies . 
But too bad . I 'm too far away . 
What are you doing right now ? 
Shit . 
It 's flying in from the left side . 
A diagonal direction ? 
The sound of the gunshot came from much higher and farther away . 
What ? 
Where did she go ? 
- Yes ? Go forward a bit . Going forward a bit . 
What is it ? 
Are you going to jump from there ? 
One . 
Two . Three . 
Fuck . 
EPISODE 1 MURTHEHELP Hey , stop . - Let go ! - Come on . 
Take it easy ! Easy ! - Officer . 
- Yes ? Do you know what happened to me ? Come on . 
I 'm the one that got hit . She 's the one that hit me ! - What ? 
- I 'm telling you , I 'm the victim ! 
- Get up ! - Calm down ! 
Get up and kick me like you did earlier ! 
Sir , you 're too worked up . Please calm down , okay ? Excuse me ? 
When can I leave ? 
We 're going to obtain the footage from the security cameras . You can leave after that . 
But ... 
- Did you really beat him like that ? 
- Calm down so we can hear you . 
- What 's the problem ? Just let the law punish her . What 's the problem ? - Come on . 
- Am I wrong ? 
What is this ? Can 't I go now ? 
I didn 't do anything wrong . 
He 's the one that came into the women 's restroom . 
I 'm not saying you did anything wrong . But you can 't just beat up people like that . You shouldn 't have done that . 
We wouldn 't have to do this if you had just held him . 
He says he 's going to sue you for assault . 
But he tried to throw a punch first . 
Jian , you can 't solve this on your own . Call your guardian . 
You need to settle with him . Can you call your parents or a family member ? 
- Ms. Jeong Jian ? 
This is Park Jinwoo , from Yecheong Police Station . 
I was just about to call you . Sorry ? 
Why would the police call me ? 
Well ... Please don 't be too alarmed . Mr. Jeong Jinman is dead . 
Why install security bars on the fifth floor ? 
What kind of crazy thief would climb up to the fifth floor to steal something ? 
- I don 't even have any money . - It 's done . There . 
Also , this closet . 
I know you paid for it , but shouldn 't you have considered my taste ? 
You really think this suits a 20-year-old girl 's room ? 
It 's retro . 
You kids like retro things . 
Unbelievable . 
Also , take a look at this closet . 
It 's made of iron , right ? 
It 's bulletproof . It was very expensive . 
What if it rains bullets ? 
Can you hear me ? It sounds bulletproof , right ? 
You 'll be safe in here . 
Why would it rain bullets here ? 
Forget it . 
Just forget it . 
Hey , Uncle . Remember the convenience store owner who shorted me ? 
He got into a car accident a few days ago . He hurt his arms and legs . 
He needs six months in the hospital . 
I don 't know what the accident did to him , but he called and said he 'd wire me all the money he didn 't pay me . 
And not just me but all the part-timers . 
Isn 't that crazy ? 
I was so pissed back then . 
I did what you taught me and shouted your name at the sky three times . 
- I think that really worked . - Right . 
I did that . 
I broke his arms and legs . 
Uncle . You have a lot of scars on your face , so you have the face of a criminal . 
You can 't joke around like that . 
Why are you taking pictures of this ? 
Why are you crossing the line ? 
When a soldier dies in a war , they lodge their dog tag between the teeth to remember their service number . 
Your registration number follows you from birth to death . 
It means that the number given to you is very , very important . 
What are you talking about ? 
It 's the same with your school ID number . Make sure you never forget it . 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
Memorize the number all of a sudden ? 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
The last thing he said to me is my school ID number . 
I was just wondering ... You 're Jinman 's niece , aren 't you ? 
I 'm a friend of Jinman . 
We went to the same middle and high school . 
I saw you a few times when you were younger . 
I don 't know if you remember me . 
Oh ... Hello . Hi to you too . 
Wow ! You got so big ! 
I heard you attend school in Seoul . Are you visiting your uncle ? 
So , how is Jinman ? 
He 's dead . 
Don 't hold the funeral here . 
The funeral home at that intersection is better . 
This place is big , but it 's lousy on the inside . 
I 'll call an employee I know that works there . 
Once you book the room ... Hold on . 
This is my card . 
Call me at this number . 
Don 't worry too much . 
Thank you . 
Right , we 'll verify the identity of the body now . 
Is this Mr. Jeong Jinman ? 
But I was wondering ... When people commit suicide , don 't they normally slit their wrists ? 
He was alone . How did he cut his throat like this ? 
Yes , we investigated it as a possible homicide due to his injury , but no one was caught on the security cameras around his house for a week . 
Also , according to the autopsy report , judging by the angle of the wound , it could have been made by himself . So we have concluded that it was a suicide . 
If you want , I can send you the autopsy report . 
It 's just like him to die like this . 
Excuse me ? 
His death suits him . 
No . 
I don 't need the autopsy report . 
That confirms the identity of the body . 
We 'll proceed with the handover procedure . 
Sign here , and it will be complete . 
Then , the handover procedure is now complete . 
There are two types of mourning clothes . 
This is the common set , and this is the modern hanbok . 
You can pick between the two . 
Did my uncle always have that tattoo ? 
You can 't smoke in here ! 
I 'm sorry . 
Anyway , let me go over it again . 
You need to pick a mourning suit . 
- Here 's the hairpin ... - I 'm the chief mourner . What about the armband ? 
Oh , normally men wear the armbands . 
Do you have any close male relatives ? No , there 's no one . 
Oh ... 
Well , the most important thing is the portrait of the deceased . 
Do you have a picture of the deceased ? 
Jeong Jian ? 
It is you . 
Do you remember me ? 
Bae Jeongmin . 
Are you okay ? 
Yeah , I remember you . Bae Jeongmin . 
We can cut out the picture of your uncle 's face and stick it on like this . 
I major in computer engineering . 
This is easy . 
That 's how I came to help your uncle . 
After the military service , I came back home and saw your uncle 's notice looking for part-time help . 
He was trying to revamp his agricultural hose sales website . 
So I was working on it for a few days . 
During that time ... your uncle passed away . 
That 's why I was the last person to contact him . 
And I 'm the one the police called first . 
I don 't know what to say ... I don 't know how to console you . 
Your uncle was found in the bathroom , right ? 
Have you cleaned it up ? 
No , not yet . 
Jian . If it 's too hard for you , do you want me to clean it up ? 
Your uncle and I were pretty close . 
I think it 'll be okay for me to do it . 
I would really appreciate it . 
Sure . I 'll clean up the bathroom . 
Don 't worry , and take care of his funeral . I 'll go after I 'm done . 
Thanks , Jeongmin . 
Jian . 
I brought Jinman 's childhood friends . 
Make sure to remember all of this . You have to pay them back one day . 
The gym at Yecheong Intersection . 
The owner is the president of Yecheong High Alumni Association . 
This is from Yecheon Middle School Alumni Association . 
Also , this is from Lee Yonghan . 
COMRADE LEE YONGHAN I don 't really know who this is . 
You have a guest ! 
- Miss , come here . - Okay . I 'll take care of things here . 
Go and greet the guests . 
Are you okay ? 
I 'm fine , but ... 
Jeong . So this is how you go . 
I 'll see you later in hell . 
Do you need anything else ? 
We have pancakes . Do you want some ? 
So you were colleagues of Jinman , right ? 
All right . 
What a bunch of rude jerks . 
They should respond when someone talks to them . 
Aren 't those twins from the neighborhood ? 
Come on . I know everyone in this neighborhood . 
They 're all outsiders . 
Jinman ! 
What 's with him ? Did Jinman owe him money or something ? 
Or did he date Jinman ? 
He 's been crying like that for two days . 
That 's what I 'm saying . 
By the way , why did Jinman commit suicide ? 
You know , he was selling those hoses on the Internet . 
I think it wasn 't going well . 
He had a lot of debt . 
Money 's always the problem . 
If that was the case , why didn 't you help him ? 
You run seven greenhouses ! 
Why should I ? 
I 've never liked Jinman . 
That 's because you got your ass handed to you by Jinman when he caught you robbing younger kids . 
- No , I didn 't ! - Yes , you did . 
Jinman knocked out three of your teeth ! I saw it ! 
Jinman was so popular back then . 
Hey ! Did you hear ? 
Before Jinman came back home , he was the leader of Mokpo 's Wasp Gang . 
What the hell are you talking about ? 
Jinman was not a gangster . 
It 's true ! The Wasp Gang ! 
You don 't know anything at all ! 
This is a real secret that only few people know . 
There 's a rumor ... that Jinman was an anti-North spy for the NIS . 
What a load of crock . 
What you just said is absolutely ridiculous . 
He got terrible grades at school ! 
He pretty much got straight F 's ! 
F , F , F , F , F ! 
How could he have joined the NIS with his grades ? 
Special employment , man ! 
- The Wasp Gang ! - I 'm right ! 
You bastards ! 
You scared me . What the hell ? 
- What ? 
- What the hell ? 
You little punks ! 
You shouldn 't speak like that ! 
Don 't you remember who Jinman was to us ? 
Do you remember when our dads lost all their money to the gambling house in the neighborhood over ? 
Why would you bring that up now ? 
Your dad lost tens of millions of won . 
My dad lost the deed to the house . He came home and lit briquettes . 
My brother and I almost died ! 
Back then , I inhaled the smoke and almost died ! 
Back then ! 
Jinman ? 
It was definitely him . 
It was Jinman that left the money ? 
Jinman was the one that saved you all . 
Jinman , you bastard . 
I lived with him for ten years . But I know nothing about him . 
We 'll leave after you 're done smoking . 
Jian . 
I 'll go to the cemetery with you . 
She didn 't cry once at the funeral . 
Maybe she wasn 't that attached to him . 
Maybe they weren 't close . Oh , stop it . She can hear you . 
They 're unbelievable . 
People all mourn in different ways . 
Great job , Jian . 
I cleaned up the bathroom for you . 
Thanks , Jeongmin . 
It 's nothing . I 'm glad I could be of help . 
We were close as kids . 
I 'm relieved you 're coping better than I thought . 
Does it look like I 'm holding it together to you ? 
Well ... 
Are you not ? 
I 'm disgusted with my uncle . 
The way he died . 
Sorry . I shouldn 't say that . 
Thanks a lot . 
Once I pull myself together , I 'll call you . Let 's grab a bite to eat . 
Sure . 
Make sure to call , Jian . 
Bye . 
I already ate . 
Make yourself something to eat . 
What was so hard for you ? 
What was so hard for you ? 
You pretended to be so strong . 
What am I supposed to do all alone now ? 
Jian , I forgot to give you ... this ... 
Should I come back later ? 
Jeongmin . 
Yes ? 
I 'm not doing okay right now . 
Can you stay with me for a little while ? 
Thanks again , Jeongmin . 
No , don 't mention it . 
I don 't have anything to do at home anyway . 
I can stay longer . 
You found this in the bathroom ? 
Yes , I think it was your uncle 's . 
No , it 's not . 
We both got the latest models when I started college . 
Can this even make calls ? 
Or maybe your uncle used it for work ? 
What , like a burner phone ? 
I DEPOSITED 70 MILLION WON ! WHEN CAN I RECEIVE THE ITEM ? 
How many hoses did they buy to deposit that much ? 
Jeongmin . How much is this ? 
Eighteen ... 18.7 billion won ? 
Do you think you can earn this much from selling hoses ? 
No . 
The website that you revamped for my uncle . Can you show me ? 
70 million won 's worth of these hoses ? 
It 's a little over 11 kilometers . 
As you said , it doesn 't make sense to order that much money 's worth of hoses . 
But ... if this website was used as a front for a different website ... 
This ... 
- It 's the dark web . 
An illegal website . 
The agricultural goods website is probably a front . 
Like a passageway to this website . 
Then , what kind of website is this ? 
There are prices to the weapons here . 
It looks like a website that sells weapons . 
Weapons ? 
He sold things like this ? 
My uncle ? 
What a crazy bastard ! 
Jian , don 't let this bother you . 
This person is crazy . 
Still , just to be safe , shall we call the police ? 
Jinman , it 's Minhye . 
My uncle isn 't home today . 
Please come back next time . 
" Uncle " ? You must be his niece . 
Wow , I heard a lot about you . 
I 'm So Minhye , Jinman 's private Chinese tutor . 
Anyway , did Jinman go somewhere ? 
We have a lesson today . 
I called , but I can 't get through to him . 
As you know , he 's not the type to change plans without calling ahead . 
My uncle was learning Chinese ? 
Your front door was open , so I came in . 
If it 's all right with you , can I wait for him inside ? 
A SHOP FOR KILLERS JIAN 7 YEARS OLD I would 've prepared something had I known you were coming . 
What 's there to prepare ? We 'll eat whatever you serve . 
You come and sit too . 
Yes , come and sit . 
Is it good ? 
Does it taste good ? 
It must be really good . You shoved all of that down your throat . 
You sure know how to stuff your face . 
- Stop that . - It 's good . 
You know how good our food is . Why haven 't you come by more often ? 
Wait a second . How long has it been ? 
Mom . 
- Has it been five or six years ? 
- Seven years and eight months . 
Almost eight years . 
My God , little brother . 
You haven 't called or visited us for eight years ? 
Since I didn 't hear from you once , I figured you were on a boat somewhere and died at sea . 
- You know ? 
- Goodness . 
Stop that ! 
Honey , that 's enough . 
Jinman , do you want more meat ? 
Yes , please . 
What happened to your face ? 
- Did you get into a fight ? 
- No , it 's just a scratch . 
You should be more careful . My son . 
- You need to get married . - Yeah , right ! Look at this bum , Mom ! 
Women would run away from him ! 
- Damn it . - Stop it , honey . 
- Jeong Jian . - That 's my girl . 
Do you know my name ? 
I don 't . 
Jeong Jinman . 
Remember it . 
My baby .
