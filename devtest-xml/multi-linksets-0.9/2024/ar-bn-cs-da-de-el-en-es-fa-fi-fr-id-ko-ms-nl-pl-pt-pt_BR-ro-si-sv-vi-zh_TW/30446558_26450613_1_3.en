Hold on . 
Let me take a look . 
Jian , are you back from school ? 
The house is perfectly fine . Why are you breaking it down ? 
This house is not perfectly fine . 
On the surface , yes , it looks fine . Nice and strong . 
But it 's not strong at all . Especially this room . The roof might fall any second . 
That 's why repair work needs to be done as soon as possible . 
Stay somewhere else for two weeks . 
It will be strong after we repair it . 
Okay , whatever . 
Fine . 
In that case , add a window to my room while you 're at it . 
What room doesn 't have a window ? 
Window ? 
A window . That 'll cost more . 
Up the price . 
Korean beef ? 
- Okay , I like Korean beef . - Let 's eat that . 
You have to pay triple for the window . 
I 'm sorry , how much ? 
He 's angry . 
Pork belly , then . 
Let 's eat pork belly . 
Just double , then . 
All right , fine . 
Nice . 
Thank you , sir . 
Thank you , sir . 
See you later , sir ! 
We 'll see you in two weeks . 
Thank you , sir . 
Where do we stay for two weeks ? 
Jirisan Mountain . 
What ? 
There 's ... a cave . 
Why is there a cave here ? 
What a relief . 
That 's true . 
Be careful . 
Darn it . 
You 're too ... 
You 're way too hot ! 
Once the high fever subsides , hypothermia will set in . 
Damn ... 
I can 't believe I 'll get hypothermia in the mountains at night . 
This is ridiculous . 
Exactly . 
We should 've gone to a hotel or a motel . Or some nice and quiet campsite . 
Why explore this mountain ? 
You even hurt your leg ! 
That 's my hurt leg . 
Listen up , Jian . 
When you 're in a difficult situation , instead of arguing over right and wrong , it 's important to find a way to solve the problem and overcome the situation . 
Okay ? 
What the heck ? 
Are you lecturing me now ? 
We don 't even know where we are . 
What 's that ? 
You had a map ? 
I think - this is where we are . - Okay . So if you walk five or six kilometers this way , there will be a shelter with an emergency phone . 
Can you get there on your own ? 
I have to . 
You 'll become one with Mother Nature if I don 't . 
Right . I love nature . 
That wouldn 't be so bad . It sounds good to me too . I 'll get to live on my own . 
Right , Jian . Hold on . 
Just in case , take this with you . 
What 's so funny ? 
Do you know how many wild boars are in this mountain ? 
What if you run into one ? 
Wild boars are scary . 
If they 're hungry and have nothing to eat , they try to eat humans too . 
What are you doing ? 
Are you trying to scare your rescuer ? 
Are you scared ? 
Of course not ! 
I should run away if I meet a boar . How will this help ? 
If you think you 're in danger , shout out my name at the sky three times . 
" Jeong Jinman , Jeong Jinman , Jeong Jinman ! " 
Then ... I might just show up . 
What a load of bull . 
Uncle . I clearly saw you sweat a lot . 
Are you sure you 're sick ? 
I 'm burning up ! 
Come on . 
Don 't you remember when you were little ? 
When the bullies at school locked you up , you shouted my name and I magically appeared . 
No , I don 't remember . 
Anyway , leave this if you don 't need it . Wait ! 
Wait here . 
I 'll call for help and be right back . 
Be careful , okay ? Okay ! 
Hey . 
Pasin , it 's me . 
The drugs are incredible . 
Jian is on her way down . 
Okay . 
We should let her decide herself . 
Is this the right path ? 
I found it . 
Only the weak bark . 
The strong don 't . 
You must become strong . 
Whatever makes you scared , keep your eyes open and face it . 
You were sweating with a fever . 
What 's going on ? 
I didn 't have to climb down alone . 
Nature must 've healed me quickly . 
I think nature fits me well . 
And your leg ? 
It still hurts . 
You saw me limping earlier . 
And where on earth did you get that kind of gun ? 
It was in the backpack . 
Pasin lent it to me . 
Why does he have a gun to begin with ? 
Wait . 
So you had a real gun , but you gave me a slingshot ? 
What kind of uncle are you ? 
That 's because you don 't know how to use a gun . 
A gun ? 
Where did you get that ? 
Isn 't it illegal ? 
Do you want to try it ? 
Listen up , Jian . 
Guns are double-edged swords . 
With this gun , you can protect yourself , and you can save your companions . But someone always gets killed by it . 
Keep that in mind . 
This is the magazine . This is the barrel . This is the slide . Inside is the bolt . 
That 's the recoil spring , and that 's the frame . 
Align your sights . Take a deep breath . 
Are you okay ? 
Jeongmin , snap out of it ! 
Do you want to die here ? 
Shit . They 've pulled out all the stops . 
This ... isn 't right . 
We have to get out . 
Jeongmin . 
Bae Jeongmin . I ... I 'm Jian 's friend . 
What did you just ... 
Was it you that tried to kill us ? What 's that ? 
Let go of me ! Let go ! 
Let go of me ! Let go ! 
You move without thinking . You 're the opposite of your uncle . But you better think and move like your uncle from now on . If you want to survive . 
What the hell 's going on ? Is someone with her ? 
Shit . 
I could 've taken her out with my first shot . 
Come on , Seongjo . If you did that , what 's the point of having all the guys here ? 
- I should give them a chance too . 
- Of course . 
Have this and keep it up . Let 's get something nice to eat when we 're done . 
I 'm not here to fight you . I 'm here to protect you . 
Who are you ? 
What did you do to Jeongmin ? 
Don 't worry . He 's not dead . 
Think about it , Jian . 
Didn 't you find it strange ? 
" Shout ' Jeong Jinman ' at the sky three times . " 
You 've done it just three times in the last ten years . 
When you were bullied by a girl in middle school , when you were sexually harassed , and this year . Your boss at the convenience store that tried to stiff you . 
What happened to them all ? 
You probably don 't know , but there 's a code implanted in your forearm . 
You and your uncle are the only two green codes . 
Whoever received a code has a duty to protect you , Jeong Jian . 
That 's why everyone was mobilized when you shouted his name . 
That girl in your class was transferred . The pervert from college dropped out . And your boss had an accident , right ? 
Darn it . 
What on earth ... 
What the hell are you saying ? 
You saw just now , the drones trying to kill you . 
Seongjo must 've pulled some strings . 
All right , let 's go if you 're ready . 
Mr. Kim , it 's a house with one girl . 
Isn 't this overkill ? 
I know she 's Jeong Jinman 's niece , but she 's just a 21-year-old kid . 
Right . 
I hope you 're right . But I don 't know . 
Team members . Follow my instructions from now on . 
In an emergency , if you decide to break away and die from your own judgement , you 'll be departing this life for chump change with no insurance and no one to blame . 
So keep that in mind and try to keep up . - Yes , sir . 
- Yes , sir . 
One , two . Testing . Mic test . 
Seongjo , can you hear me ? 
Yes , loud and clear . 
Don 't move and stay there ! 
What the hell ? 
How could that be there ? 
Hey , it 's me . 
I think someone 's helping the kid . 
Damn it , there 's too much smoke . I can 't see anything . 
Can you clear out the smoke ? 
God damn it . 
Minhye ? 
My , my . 
Minhye ? 
This changes everything . 
Everyone , wait ! 
What the hell is Minhye doing there ? Seongjo ? 
Is that Minhye in the rabbit hole ? 
Minhye 's Class S holding Codes Red and Purple . 
You 'll have to pay more for risk . 
Fine , just proceed . We don 't have much time . 
Then , I 'll trust you and proceed . 
- Yes , sir . Yes , sir . 
Everyone 's all about money . 
Seongjo ? Who 's Minhye ? 
Just a crazy bitch . 
Now , let 's begin the rabbit hunt ! 
Teams 1 and 2 of Group 1 has begun the rabbit hunt . 
Fifteen hundred meters to the rabbit . 
Come back alive ! 
Listen up , Jian . 
It 's flying in from the left side . A diagonal direction ? 
The sound of the gunshot came from much higher and farther away . 
What ? 
Where did she go ? 
- Hey , Bongo . 
- Yes ? Go forward a bit . 
Going forward a bit . 
One . 
Two . 
Three . 
Have you shot a gun before ? 
Yes . 
Not that one . 
When it comes to shooting , pistols and rifles are the same anyway . 
Pull the lever on the right and insert the bullet . 
You just need to load it . 
What the fuck ? 
Look at this bitch ! 
She 's Jeong Jinman 's niece indeed ! 
I can 't believe he stuck a gun under the sofa . 
That 's just like my dear Jinman . 
Your what ? 
What ... do we do now ? 
The impatient always die first . 
God damn it ! 
Minhye , that bitch . How much is she getting paid ? 
There 's no time . 
I 'll cover you . Go into the storage shed . 
The storage shed ? 
Yes , on the floor of your uncle 's workroom , there 's a door into murthehelp . 
I 'm going to protect you until you get in there safely . 
I promised your uncle . 
How can I trust you ? Why should I listen to you ? 
Aren 't you curious as to who your uncle really was ? 
Go right now ! 
Look at that . 
Mr. Kim ? 
The rabbits are moving towards the storage shed . 
Get a move on , will you ? 
We just have to go through there . 
Let 's go . 
I knew it . 
There it is . 
Jeongmin , get up ! 
Got you . 
That little bitch . 
Where my uncle worked ? 
What is this ? 
What is it ? Try his birthday . 
His birthday ? Birthday ... 
My birthday ? 
Damn it ! What is it ? 
Hurry up , Jian ! 
Listen up , Jian . 
It 's the same with your school ID number . 2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4 . 
It worked . 
What ? 
It 's really here . 
Jian . 
Oh ... Hi , Jeong Jian . 
I 'm Brother .
