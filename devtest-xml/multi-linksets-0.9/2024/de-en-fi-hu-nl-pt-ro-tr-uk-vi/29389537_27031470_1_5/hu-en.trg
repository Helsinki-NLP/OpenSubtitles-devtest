Is someone there ? 
Who 's there ? 
Marina , what are you doing here ? 
My grandmother used to say , " If you want smooth skin , use lemon . " 
With this cream , you 'll look so young at the wedding . 
You 'll see . 
I 'll make some coffee . 
I 'm sorry I was mean . 
Can you forgive me ? 
You have to remove the old skin or the cream won 't work . 
Relax . 
It 'll only take a moment . 
Honey , don 't worry . Marina knows what she 's doing . 
- Don 't you want to look pretty for me ? 
- Don 't you want to look pretty for him ? 
What 's going on ? 
A dream . 
Just a bad dream . 
UNKNOWN NUMBER HELLO ! 
YOU CAN BLOCK ME , BUT I 'LL ALWAYS COME BACK ... 
You should be up here in this beautiful wedding dress , not me . 
Stop it , Mom . If you want to do this , do it right . 
- I 'm 60 . 
- Of the two of us , you 're the coolest . 
- She 's taking it . 
- Perfect . 
Fine , I 'll take it . 
Try this one . 
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR NUMBER , I 'LL FIND YOU . 
What 's going on ? 
Is something wrong ? 
No . No , annoying work stuff . 
I 'm sorry , ma 'am . It seems your cards have been blocked . 
- Yes , absolutely . 
- Thanks . 
You had my cards blocked ? 
Would you leave us alone ? Thank you . 
- Sit down , Mom , so we can talk . - I 'm not sitting . 
I 'm fine here . 
So ? 
The legal process is too long . 
I couldn 't risk you ruining yourself . 
The legal process for what ? 
Exploiting a vulnerable adult . 
Exploiting a vulnerable adult ? 
Help me understand . 
Am I the vulnerable one ? 
You can 't understand now . 
You haven 't been in your right mind for months . I did it for you . 
To stop this farce of a wedding that will ruin you . 
Stefano , what are you saying ? 
I 'll take care of you , whether you like it or not . 
One more thing . It 's best you hear it from me . 
- Okay , thanks . 
- Good day . 
It 's a notice of indictment . 
Dad and I have filed a complaint against Elia . 
To what do I owe this visit ? 
Did you miss me ? 
I need the money back . 
- Why should I give it back ? 
- Because I got a notice of indictment . Gabriella 's family is suing me . 
If they dig around , they could find out about Ibiza . 
Those people will find you . 
But if you give me the money , I 'll talk to Gabriella 's son . 
- I can convince him to stop . 
- Don 't you see it 's too late ? 
Please , don 't force me to ask you the hard way . 
They sent a notice . They 're investigating . 
Your name will come out anyway . 
Do you want to risk it ? 
What should I do ? 
We have to leave . 
No . I can 't leave Gabriella . 
It 's always been you and me , right ? 
From the very beginning . 
It has to end with us . 
Let 's go . The three of us . 
Only then will we be safe . 
I 've missed this . 
What ? 
This . 
The sea , the boat . 
Sailing off , the two of us . 
It 's not a pleasure trip , Marina . 
It could become one . 
If we don 't stop at night , we 'll be in Tangier in three days . 
Then I 'll figure out what to do . 
Relax . 
We 'll find a nice place . 
I don 't know . Maybe by the sea . 
I 'm sure it won 't take you long to find the right people . 
Like in Ibiza . 
You 're insane . 
I just fixed a problem . That 's it . 
Exploitation of a vulnerable adult ? 
As if your mom is a madwoman . 
- Don 't raise your voice . 
- Fuck off ! 
- What do you want from me , Ester ? 
- I begged you to drop it ! To focus more on our family ! 
But you continue with this fucking madness ! 
I feel like you 're the one who 's losing it . 
You think you can control us all ? 
That we 're your puppets ? 
- You need to calm down . - Or else ? You 'll lock me in an asylum ? 
- I 'm sorry . Sorry . Forg ... 
- Don 't touch me . 
Honey . 
Sofia . 
We 're going to my parents ' . 
UNKNOWN NUMBER I MISSED YOU ... 
WHY HAVEN 'T YOU WRITTEN TO ME ANYMORE ? 
SORRY , I MISSED YOU SO MUCH ... I THOUGHT I 'D COME TO YOU . 
OPEN UP ? 
Go away ! Go away , or I 'll call the police ! 
Fuck . 
UNKNOWN NUMBER I KNOW HOW TO GET IN ANYWAY ... 
MOM MOBILE CALL 
Giulia ? What 's going on ? 
Mom , please , I 'm scared . 
I 'm locked in the bathroom . 
- Someone 's trying to break in . Help me ! - What do you mean ? 
- What 's going on ? 
- Mom , please , come here . 
Who 's there ? 
Giulia ! Giulia ! 
Giulia , where are you ? 
Sweetheart . 
- Mom . 
- Come here . 
Sweetheart . 
Calm down . 
- It 's over . 
- Yeah . 
Thank you . 
Yes , we 're very happy . 
Yes , it 's a big relief . 
It was the police . They found him . 
He was lurking outside your house in a car . 
Fear no more , the danger 's over . 
Thank you for coming . 
I 'm always here . Even if it doesn 't look like it . 
I made many mistakes with you . 
If we 'd had a different relationship , you would have talked to me about this dangerous guy . Right ? 
Do you still have that awful jasmine herbal tea ? 
Shall we make some ? 
Thank you . 
Yes . 
Still awful . 
Dad told me what happened . 
- How are you ? 
- I survived . 
Thanks to Mom . 
Why didn 't you call the police ? 
You drove at night . 
What were you thinking ? 
I did what I had to do . I rescued my daughter . 
I 'm glad , Stefano , that you care about Giulia . But now you have to leave . 
You 're not welcome here . 
What are you saying , Mom ? 
Need I remind you that you 're suing Elia , and that you think I 'm incompetent ? 
Stefano , what have you done ? 
- That 's why they blocked your cards ? - Yes . 
And I 'm convinced I did the right thing . 
Where is Elia now ? 
Why isn 't he here ? 
He ran away , didn 't he ? 
You need to leave ! 
And leave your keys . 
I don 't want you in and out without permission . 
Someday you 'll thank me . 
- Has he really left ? 
- I don 't know . 
Anyway , I don 't know where he is . 
Remember at the reopening party , when they thought Elia was my boyfriend ? 
I envied you so much . And not because Elia is hot , and I only seem to attract crazy psychos . 
But because I saw you in that moment ... madly in love . 
And I realized that that is true happiness . Loving someone . 
I haven 't experienced that . 
I was about to do something stupid . 
Take me away with you . 
How ? 
You have your children , your hotel . 
Your life . 
That was my life before I met you . 
I 've never felt as alive as I do now . 
Me neither . 
I want to leave everything to my children . And I want to be with the man I love . 
I love you too . 
That 's why I came back . 
I don 't care about the trial , the money , or ending up in jail . 
I want to be with you . 
We can 't get married while you 're under investigation . 
I know . 
That 's why we can 't let them win . 
No . 
The last time we came here I was 12 , remember ? 
You collected me from school because you knew I hadn 't studied . 
You loved this place . 
Why did we stop coming ? 
You divorced Mom . 
Ah , speaking of Mom . You must 've noticed she hasn 't been herself for a while . 
Suing Elia is the only way to protect her . 
Do we have to talk about it ? Yes . 
See , Nico , you got to know Elia better than any of us . 
You lived with him . So what ? 
If you want to help Mom , your testimony at the trial will be crucial . 
You must tell us everything . 
If you saw him go out with someone , like that girl who was at the hotel . 
If he took money from Mom . 
- You want to help Mom , don 't you ? 
- Of course . 
He even tried to kiss you , right ? 
That asshole took me out to eat to convince me to testify against her . 
Will you ? I don 't know . I mean ... 
Elia 's a piece a shit , that 's for sure . But who am I , a fucking rat ? 
But why don 't they leave me alone ? 
Let 's go out . 
Wait . 
I have a better idea . 
- What 's that ? 
- The key to your father 's wine cellar . 
- Who are you ? 
- Let 's make him pay . 
If he finds out , he 'll kill us . 
Mom ? 
Mom . Mom , what are you doing ? Mom ! 
Mom , aren 't you feeling well ? 
I love you , Mom . 
I 've been calling you all day . 
I had to keep my phone line free for a work thing . 
Your new job allows you to drink whiskey at five in the afternoon ? 
- What do you want ? 
- We need to talk about Mom . 
Drop the charges . 
Actually , since the criminal is back , I need you to testify at the trial too . 
And say what ? 
That you don 't like Mom 's boyfriend ? 
He 's dangerous . 
What do you think he 'll do ? Kidnap her and ask for a ransom ? 
You need help . I need help ? 
You 're on your fucking cell phone from morning to night , and ruin yourself with plastic surgery . 
I came to tell you you 're an asshole for what you 're doing . 
But the truth is , I just feel sorry for you . 
Think what you want . 
Don 't do it for me . 
Do it for our mother . 
Grow up , Stefano . 
Gabriella . 
- What 's going on ? 
- Hi , Delia . 
Hello . 
I 'm not here to ask for a shoulder to cry on . 
I need a lawyer . And damn it , you 're the best . 
I know Mario is involved in this situation , so ... 
Give me an honest answer . 
Would you be willing to defend Elia ? 
Only if you stop talking to me like we haven 't known each other forever . 
Is that a yes ? 
I can 't say it 'll be easy . Because it won 't be . 
But we can try . 
I can 't believe it . 
Are you here to ask for an illegal search ? 
Or to frame someone by planting cocaine in their house ? 
I 'm an asshole . 
Yes , you are . 
I won 't ask you for anything else . 
Can I come in ? 
I don 't want to be alone tonight . 
Good morning . 
It 's almost lunchtime , actually . 
Any coffee ? 
Are you ignoring me ? 
- I 'm working for you , you know ? 
- How so ? 
I couldn 't stop thinking about the loan Elia took in Ibiza , and the partner he mentioned to your mother . 
Doing some research , in ways I 'd have rather avoided , I came across the name of this Francesco Rossetti . 
PARTY ! 
It 's him . 
That 's not all . 
His profile 's been inactive for months . He hasn 't posted since February 18th . 
He disappeared . 
February 18th ? 
It 's just before Elia met my mother . 
Exactly . 
In my job , this is called a lead . 
If we find out what happened to this Francesco Rossetti , we 'll have more info about Elia . 
What would I do without you ? 
Why are you helping me ? 
Because I love you . 
If you allow me , I 'll record . 
I do it all the time . 
Can I ? 
- Yes . - Yes . 
Let 's start with the easy stuff . Expenses . 
How many times a week do you go out to dinner ? 
- Three , four times a week . 
- Yes . 
And who pays ? 
I usually pay . 
But he contributes in other ways . 
Okay . We can check this from his credit card statement . 
Do you also want grocery receipts ? 
I know it 's unpleasant . But we have no choice . 
I have to know everything . Every single expense . 
Every little transaction , the most insignificant thing . 
Let 's start from the beginning . 
At first , I lent him 200 euros for the mechanic . 
- I paid you back the next day , Gabriella . 
- Yes , he paid me back . 
Then I gave you the bracelet . 
I still have the receipt for that . 
First , I had given him my father 's watch . 
You gave him a watch from Luigino 's collection ? 
Yes . 
Is this a fucking interrogation ? 
Couples give each other gifts . 
I have nothing to hide . 
So you won 't have a problem if I ask my studio to look into your financial situation , right ? 
Right . No problem . 
If you 'll excuse me . 
Stefano . 
Can we talk ? 
- What are you doing here ? 
- Withdraw the complaint . 
Your mom 's devastated and can 't sleep . 
Don 't do it for me . Do it for her . 
- Getting desperate , huh ? 
- Stefano , listen . 
You could ask for help from your friend Francesco . 
Yes , Francesco Rossetti . 
Though you two haven 't spoken in a while , have you ? 
I don 't have every piece yet , but it 's only a matter of time . 
I like to see you like this . With the look of someone who knows he 's fucked . 
Mister Lawyer . 
- How was your day ? 
- Good . Let 's go . 
What should I get you ? 
The usual . Tuna nigiri and teriyaki salmon . 
- All right . 
- With a lot of wasabi . 
Yes . Where 's my wallet ? 
- Here . 
- Thank you . 
I 'll be right back . 
Hurry . I 'm hungry . 
You don 't deserve him . 
It 's clear that he 'd do anything for you . 
I don 't know what you mean . 
You know , Stefano , I 'm also good at taking pictures . 
And I have to say that this one came out particularly well . 
Don 't look so scared . 
Withdraw the complaint , and I won 't say anything to your wife . 
How do I know you really won 't ? 
You can trust me . 
This is not a personal thing . 
In fact , unlike you , I don 't take any pleasure in screwing you . 
Do you know why ? 
Because I only like screwing your mom . 
Where the fuck are you ? 
You left two hours ago . 
I 'm getting worried . 
It 's over . 
Please , don 't contact me anymore . 
You 're sure you don 't want me with you ? 
I know you don 't trust my driving . 
But I have to practice . And you can 't stop me . 
Oh my God . 
- Who could have done this ? 
- Maybe some kid passing by . 
No , this is a private lot . It 's only for clients and staff . 
Who would do such a thing ? 
Marina . 
Why would it be Marina ? 
No , sorry , I 'm talking nonsense . 
I would never let anyone hurt you , Gabriella . 
Never . 
Fuck off ! 
I didn 't do anything . I don 't care if you don 't believe me ! 
Stay away from her , or the deal is off . 
The deal ? 
How can you give me money if her accounts are closed ? 
That 's my problem . And I 'm already fixing it . 
- It 's a matter of hours . 
- Yes , of course . 
We could 've been in Morocco by now . Safe . 
I made a choice , Marina . 
I love her . Even if you don 't want to understand . 
You don 't love anyone . 
You only love yourself . 
It 's more convenient to think that I slashed her tires . Because you know what happens if they find you . 
Delia is good . 
Elia has a chance to win . 
- What are we going to do ? 
- " We " ? 
- What am " I " going to do ? It 's always me . 
- How dare you talk to me like that ? 
That 's how you talk to worthless men . 
Look at yourself . 
You had three children and never gave a shit about them . 
You cheated on your wife with her friend . The same bitch who 's defending that criminal . 
You 've never taken any responsibility . Never . In your entire life . 
All you 've ever done is ask . 
I have always tried to protect my family ! 
You don 't know shit about taking care of a family ! 
The sacrifice it takes . Fuck off . 
- Everything all right ? 
- Yes , thanks . 
- Yes , ma 'am . - Good day . 
- Why are you here ? 
- I 'm ending this madness . 
Why the fuck are you with that con man ? 
How dare you talk to me like that in front of everyone ? 
I took this too lightly . 
Stefano was right . 
I was only thinking about myself . But now I 'm here . 
For you . For our family . 
I remind you we 're divorced . 
If you can 't stop yourself , I 'll stop you . 
I 'll show you who Elia really is . 
Let me go . 
Hey . 
What 's going on ? 
I 'm talking to my wife , Elia . 
She 's not your wife . I think you should go now . 
- I think I 'll be staying for a while . 
- Mario , please . 
You think you 're in charge . You 're not in charge of shit . 
Indeed . Gabriella is in charge here . And she asked you to leave . 
You think you know everything . Right ? 
Now I 'll tell you something you don 't know . 
In fact , you know what ? She will tell you . 
Come on , Gabriella . 
Tell him what you and I did . 
Stop it , Mario . 
Ask her how she was fucked . 
Mario , please . 
I bet now you want to smash my face in , huh ? 
Go ahead . 
Smash my face in . You puppet . 
Stop it . Stop . 
I think the only puppet here is you , Mario . 
You 'd have loved to show up in court with a black eye . 
Fuck that . 
Elia ! 
I was willing to lose it all for you ! Even go to jail ! 
No , wait . Wait , let me explain . 
That evening in the pool , with that young , pretty girl , I felt old . 
Ridiculous . 
And when I was alone with Mario , a man who had betrayed me , who had rejected me , and now he wanted me , he desired me ... I felt strong . I felt powerful . 
That 's why I did it . 
Only for that reason . 
But I 'm yours . 
I am yours . 
Say it again . 
I 'm yours . 
Again . 
I 'm yours . 
Again . 
I 'm yours . 
I 'm yours . 
Are you sleeping ? 
No , not really . 
Are you afraid ? 
Come . I 'll take you somewhere . 
You know , it 's not too late to run away . 
Life as a fugitive has a certain appeal . 
Stop it . 
Anyway , to answer your question ... yes , I 'm afraid . 
I 'm afraid of prison . 
I 'm afraid they might take away what we have . That they change your opinion of me . 
No matter what happens , nothing can change us . 
I promise . 
BODY OF FRANCESCO ROSSETTI RECOVERED 
" Body of missing young man recovered at sea . " 
" The cause of death is still unknown . " 
" The police are investigating . " 
" Francesco Rossetti . " 
Rossetti . 
Hello ? 
Do it . Fucking out me , if you want . 
All you 'll achieve is to ruin my life . But I won 't withdraw the complaint . 
You won 't do it . 
You have everything to lose . 
Maybe . 
But if you ruin my marriage , my mother will never forgive you . 
You 'll eventually break up , and I 'll win one way or another . 
You still don 't get how important this family is to me . 
I know you 're involved in Francesco Rossetti 's death .
