- Good morning , Giovanni . 
- Morning , Mrs. Gabriella . 
You need to call pest control . 
They came after the renovations . There can 't be any rats . 
They got smart . They smell the poison . 
Okay , fine . In that case , I 'll call them again . 
Gabriella , I know you . You 're a perfectionist , and need everything under control . Fair enough . But this time you 've gotten confused , trust me . 
Rather , we should discuss the restaurant 's suppliers . 
Some contracts expire this month , and we must decide what to do . 
Gabriella , are you listening ? 
Are you okay ? 
- In the meantime , go buy the traps . - All right . 
This place is like a dream . 
Gabriella . 
You couldn 't sleep ? 
Is your room uncomfortable ? 
No , it 's perfect . 
I just saw the pool and felt like taking a swim . 
- Is it a problem ? 
- No , not at all . 
You 're my guest . You can swim when you want . 
Beethoven , can you stop ? 
I 'm trying to sleep . 
It 's Bach . And tomorrow I have an exam , so ... 
What 's going on ? 
She 's making a terrible racket . I need to fucking sleep ! 
So I can 't study anymore because he decided to move in ? 
Come on , Nico , it 's noon . You should get up anyway . 
I decide when I get up , okay ? You 're nobody . You 're not my mother . 
Woke up grumpy ? Get dressed . I 'll take you out for breakfast . 
Really ? He talks to me like that , and you take him out for breakfast ? 
Am I supposed to start yelling too ? 
Get dressed . Come on . And then at least Isa can study . 
Awesome ! 
I know it 's not your fault . But I really didn 't need this today . 
Okay , no , I 'll figure something out . 
We 'll speak later . 
Is something wrong ? 
No , it was Giuseppe , the hotel manager . 
He was going to take me into town , but his car broke down . 
It 's my fault for no longer driving . 
I 'll take you . As a way to pay you back for your hospitality . 
- No ... 
- I 'd be happy to . Really . 
Do you at least have a car ? Yes , I do have a car . 
- I 'll get changed and be right back . 
- I 'll be in the lobby . 
It belonged to my father . 
I haven 't driven it since . 
Scotto takes care of it and keeps it in top shape . 
- Beautiful . 
- The stick shift 's a bit stiff . 
Hey . Where are you going ? 
Scotto had a mishap . Marina offered to drive me . 
- No need . I 'll take you . 
- No , it 's not a problem for me . 
You go get Scotto . He 's stuck . 
I 'll get someone to open the gate . 
What are you doing ? Huh ? 
I 'll behave . 
Shall we go ? 
Yes . 
Here we go . 
This plaza 's gorgeous . 
It 's my favorite plaza . 
- Are you on vacation ? - Sort of , yeah . 
Have you been friends with Nico long ? 
A couple of weeks . 
I saw that he lived around here , and I wrote to him . 
Why not invite him to dinner ? 
We had a big argument . Now he 's not taking my calls . 
- Maybe if you ask him , he 'll come . 
Thank you . 
You and ... 
Elia , right ? 
Are you together ? Yes . 
From how long ? 
- A couple of months . 
- Really ? 
I was watching you two earlier . You look good together . 
Do you love him ? 
Let 's say we 've found each other . 
Oh , God ! 
Oh my God , what a shame ! 
The whole shoe has come apart . 
- Wait , sorry . 
- Let me help you . 
Will you be able to walk now ? 
Come , I 'll take you to a shop . 
Here . 
Thank you . 
Cute , huh ? 
What do you think ? 
Gorgeous . 
- Why don 't you try them on too ? 
Excuse me , can you bring ... 
- What 's your size ? 
- 38 . 
- A 38 . 
- They aren 't my style at all . 
I 'm sure Elia will like them . Trust me . 
Here are your shoes . 
- Here you are . 
- Thank you . 
They seem really comfortable . 
Here . 
- We 'll take them . 
- Great . 
- The hat , too . 
- Very well . 
- How do they look ? 
- They 're perfect on you . 
Let 's buy some fish . 
- Good morning , guys . 
- Ma 'am . 
- Morning . - Good morning . 
What do you have ? 
We have mullet , mackerel . Venus clams . Look . 
Not the clams . Those were frozen . 
Go get some ice . 
The weather was bad . We didn 't catch clams . 
What have you got , then ? 
How about a nice octopus ? Huh ? 
It 's good . 
Smell it . 
Smell how good it is . 
Well ... 
I 'll take this . I 'll take the whole crate . 
Wait , let me help you . 
I have a tissue . Here . 
Fragile . 
Beautiful , but fragile . 
Send the crate to the hotel . 
I thought the chefs bought the fish for the restaurant . 
Didn 't you see how they act ? 
Imagine if I sent the chefs . 
My father always went there himself . He 's the one who taught me . 
But he forgot to teach you to drive . No , he did . 
But then , at some point , I stopped . 
- So you have a license ? 
- Yes . 
- Then you drive . 
- No . 
- You drive . 
- No . 
- Have faith in yourself . 
- It would take too long . 
Don 't you want independence ? 
Let 's make this car fly . 
Release the clutch slowly . 
At your own risk . 
Here we are . 
- Good morning . - Hi . 
You did great . 
As in , we didn 't die , and I didn 't kill anyone ? 
Which is no small feat . 
- Hey . 
- Hi , Elia . 
What happened to you ? 
I tried calling you . 
I couldn 't answer . I was driving . 
Which is why , in addition to ... the shopping , it took two hours . 
She had you drive ? Yes . 
Unbelievable . 
This girl is headstrong . But I 'm so glad I did it . 
What the fuck are you doing ? Huh ? 
Easy . 
You 'll hurt the baby . 
What the fuck are you saying ? 
Ours . 
Don 't fuck with me , Marina . 
There is no baby . 
- Let go of me . 
- Say it . 
It 's the truth . 
Let me go . 
Fuck . 
I was waiting for the right time to tell you . But you ruined everything , as usual . 
When did you find out ? 
Two weeks after you left . 
I waited for you for a while . Then I learned you were here , living the good life , screwing someone your mom 's age . 
- You don 't know the situation . - What 's the situation , then ? Tell me . 
You said you 'd come back to me with the money . Or am I wrong ? 
I 'm here to find the money , as I promised . 
Do you think the old hag will be happy we 're expecting a baby ? 
Marina , think about it . 
If you ruin things with Gabriella , we 'll have nothing . 
I 'm doing it for us . 
Don 't fuck with me . You disappeared . 
I got a new phone . They were looking for me . 
- You know what they 're capable of . 
- I do . That 's why I feared something happened to you . 
Marina , come here . 
Look at me . 
- You know it 's always you and me , right ? - No , I don 't . 
Yes , you do . 
It 's always you and me . Against everything and everyone . 
Are you happy about the baby at least ? 
Yes . Of course . 
Very . 
Gabriella . 
- I didn 't mean to scare you . 
- I didn 't hear you come in . 
I heard back from the shipyard . 
They 've agreed to lower the price of the catamaran . 
Which one ? The one Nico liked ? Yes . That one . 
In fact , it 's perfect to start with . 
It has 12 beds . 
It 's comfortable , it 's fast , and , when it 's not rented out to hotel guests , we can use it . 
Where will you take me ? 
Well , with a boat like that , we could go as far as the Caribbean . 
We can set off from here . Yes . Then ? 
We head north to Gibraltar . 
We 'll go down , all the way to the Canary Islands . 
- Can we stay there for a while ? - Oh , yeah . 
And then , across the Atlantic , all the way to Antigua . 
Why did they lower the price ? 
They 're in a hurry to sell . 
We need to put a deposit down now . 
They want 450,000 euros . 
Obviously , I 'll put down half of it . 
Where will you get it ? 
I asked a friend who owes me a favor . He can give me a loan . 
No . No , Elia . 
If it relates to the hotel business , the money needs to be clean and traceable . 
Yes , but I can 't ask for another bank loan , you know that . 
- Can 't we let it slide somehow ? 
- Absolutely not . 
Then there 's nothing we can fucking do . Bye-bye boat . 
Wait . 
Let 's do this . 
I 'll buy the boat . 
But I don 't want to be your employee . I want to be your partner . 
Of course , you will be . 
When the business is up and running , we 'll start earning money , and you can repay me . And you will become my partner . 
So maybe I should start immediately . 
What can I say , Mom ? 
The investment plan is well written . 
Boat charters are a growing industry . 
There are a few points to review , but you can ask your accountant . 
But it 's a large sum . It 'll take some time to free up the money . 
- What do you think , though ? 
- It doesn 't matter what I think . 
The hotel is yours . 
What do you want to hear , Mom ? That it 's a great idea ? 
I 'd like to have a normal conversation with my son . 
I know this is Elia 's idea . 
Scotto told me . 
He 's worried about his influence over you , the decisions you let him make for the hotel . 
- He doesn 't decide anything . 
- It 's your call . 
I don 't want to be involved anymore . 
You know what I think of Elia . I don 't trust him . 
If you think buying a luxury catamaran is a good idea , go for it . 
I certainly won 't stop you . 
- Who is it ? 
- It 's Elia . 
What do you want ? 
I was in the area . I wanted to say hi . 
Can I come in ? 
Your mother says these are your favorite . 
Yes . When I was ten , and I weighed 90 kilos . 
So ? What do you want ? 
No , I noticed that you 've stopped posting . 
Has something happened ? 
I see . You failed with Nico , so now you 're trying with me ? 
I 'm just trying to have a civil relationship , considering it didn 't go well with your brothers . 
Yes , but unlike them , I don 't give a shit what my mother does . 
So you 're wasting your time if you think that being nice to me will somehow help you keep her . 
I have to go . 
Anyway , it 's true . I don 't need you to keep your mother . But she needs you . 
So ? 
Won 't you tell me what Stefano said ? 
He was thrilled . 
He said the boat charter industry is growing rapidly . 
So we 're getting the boat ? 
Yes , as soon as the money is freed up . 
Perfect . 
How long will it take ? 
I 'll set a date with the shipyard . 
Three weeks , a month ... 
A month ? 
We don 't have a month . They 'll sell it . 
So what ? 
We 'll find another one . 
It 's your son , right ? He 's doing it on purpose to ruin the deal ! 
You have no idea . 
- Don 't I ? 
- No . 
Yesterday you were ready to sail with me , and now it 'll take a month to get the money . 
The hotel has some cash flow . Let 's use that . 
Are you really telling me how to manage my money ? 
Another boat will cost us a lot more . 
Maybe you can afford to pay double the amount , but to make back the investment , I will have to work like a slave for life . 
- But what do you and Stefano care ? 
Right ? - Watch it , Elia . 
The way was paved for him . He 's never had to fight for anything . 
Do not talk like that about my son . 
Your son is a privileged man who thinks he rules the world . 
- I 'm sick of his shit ! - Enough ! 
Let me out of this car ! 
- Let me out ! - What are you doing ? Stop ! Hey . 
Calm down . 
I apologize . 
I overreacted . 
I shouldn 't have said those things . 
It 's just that I 'm tired of this war . 
Listen , Elia . 
Stefano has nothing to do with this . 
The money has to be freed up , and it takes time . 
And the hotel cash flow can 't be touched . 
It 's for emergencies . End of story . 
I know . 
And you 're right . 
If they don 't wait for us , we 'll find another boat . 
I don 't want us to fight over money . 
Me neither . 
UNKNOWN NUMBER RUNNING OFF THE PASTRIES ? 
TELL ME , WHO 'S THE ASSHOLE YOU LET INTO THE HOUSE ? 
Hello ? 
Having fun sending me these fucked-up anonymous texts ? 
What are you talking about ? 
- The photos of my house I 'm receiving . 
- What do I have to do with it ? 
Giulia , what 's going on ? 
Nothing , some asshole is sending me weird texts . 
Look , did you happen to see someone following you earlier ? 
No , I don 't think so . 
- Should I be worried ? - No . 
No . Pretend I never called . 
GIULIA WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU ? 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? 
Can 't sleep ? 
What are you doing here ? 
Marina , please , leave . 
You can 't be here . 
I bet you do this often . 
What ? 
Swimming , at night . 
Don 't . 
What are you doing ? 
The same thing you are . 
Let 's have fun together . 
You 're beautiful . 
We made him angry . 
Why did you leave ? 
I didn 't like the situation . 
What were you doing together in the pool ? 
Nothing . 
I was swimming , and then she showed up . 
That 's how it started . 
Then ? 
Then nothing . 
- You must have been happy , right ? 
Liar ! Liar ! 
You 've been constantly around her since she got here . 
Do you think I 'm an idiot ? Huh ? 
- Tell me you don 't like her . 
- Calm down . 
She 's a pretty girl , that 's all . 
I shouldn 't have fallen in love with you . 
I shouldn 't have fallen in love with you . I shouldn 't have trusted you . 
Did you want to touch her ? Huh ? Did you want to touch her breasts ? 
Touch my breasts . Touch my breasts . 
Did you want to kiss her ? 
Kiss me . Stop it . 
Why am I not enough for you ? 
Calm down . 
I 'm here . 
You know what I want ? 
That you stay with me , no matter what . 
My love . 
You 're already awake ? 
I checked my finances . 
If I divest now , I 'll lose too much money . 
Gabriella , really . It 's not necessary . 
Hold on . Let me finish . 
The catamaran is a bargain . You 're right . 
And you 're my partner . 
Here 's what we 'll do . We 'll use the hotel 's cash flow . 
I transferred the money to my bank account . 
I 'll write you a check so we can put a hold on the boat . 
Didn 't you say that money was for emergencies ? 
Yes . But I 'll put it back once I cash out the investments . 
Are you sure ? 
What else would I be doing awake at the computer at 6 : 00 a.m. ? 
I 'll get dressed and go to the shipyard , then . 
- Are you coming with me ? 
- No , I 'm too tired . 
I 'll sleep a little more . 
You 're not going back to your mom 's because of him ? 
Put yourself in my shoes . Imagine your dad having sex with your mom . They 're in the room next to yours , and you 're half in love with your dad . 
- I 'm about to throw up . 
She 's still at your mother 's place ? 
That 's 150,000 euros . I 'll get more , but you have to leave . 
I thought the three of us were having fun . 
Want to ruin everything ? 
You like to play games . I 'm worried you 're doing it with me too . 
If Gabriella finds out you 're carrying my baby , we can forget the money . 
You have to trust me . 
Or maybe you want this amazing place all to yourself . 
Get down , they 'll see you . 
From Vesuvius ? 
So you do love me a little . 
Marina . I 'm serious . 
You have to go . 
Otherwise , we really could lose it all . 
Trouble ! My baby . Hey . 
Hello . 
- Peppe . 
- Hi , Nico . 
Hi . What 's Marina Serra 's room number ? 
- Room 102 . 
- Thanks . I want to thank her for Trouble . 
Your mother is too kind . She takes in all the strays she finds . 
Must be old age . 
Just thank her and tell her you have to go . Okay ? 
No way . 
No , Nico . 
Hey . 
Fuck . 
The baits aren 't working . We have to change the traps . 
Gabriella . We 've even put down poison . 
Maybe there are no rats after all . 
I heard it . 
And if I can hear it , so can the guests . 
Nico . 
What a surprise . 
I tried to call you to tell you we had found Trouble , but you never answered . 
Are you staying for lunch ? 
- With you , Elia , and his friend ? 
- What do you mean ? 
Mom , wake up . You don 't see shit ! 
I saw them kissing upstairs . 
Don 't beat around the bush ! 
Do you like this girl ? 
She 's young , she 's beautiful , she 's your age . 
There you go again . Always the same problem . She 's my age . 
What are you doing ? 
We 're talking ! 
No , we 're not . You 're yelling at me . 
You have two options . Either trust me , or don 't . 
If you don 't , there 's nothing I can do . 
We 'd better end it now . Huh ? 
What is that ? A threat ? 
I accept everything you say , or you leave me ? 
If you don 't trust yourself , you will never trust others . And I can 't help that . 
Gabriella , what 's going on ? 
What ... Are you okay ? The rat . I got it . 
And tell Miss Serra to vacate the room . 
Her holiday here is over . 
Very well . 
I know you don 't care , but I 'll tell you anyway . 
Elia 's fucking a girl in the hotel . 
How do you know ? 
I 've seen them . 
It 's the one who brought Trouble home after I lost him . 
And now she 's Mom 's guest . 
I caught him in her room . 
I 'll send a photo . 
Are you ready ? 
We 'll be late . 
I 'm glad you told me . But I have to go now . 
Who was it ? 
Nothing , the office . A problem with a client . 
- I have to go check on it . 
- Right now ? 
- We have to see Sofia 's therapist . 
- I know , but it 's a delicate matter . 
If you want , I 'll call the psychologist to cancel . 
Forget it . 
I 'll go . 
We must find out who she is . 
Look into Elia 's assets . I want to know what he did with the money he took in Spain . 
Sorry . I forgot you only come to me if you need me to investigate your mother 's boyfriend . 
- It 's not true . - Really ? 
I feel constantly blackmailed . 
I 'm not blackmailing you . I 'm asking for help . 
What if I can 't help you anymore ? 
We no longer see each other ? 
- Stop it . 
- No , I won 't . 
What you 're asking is illegal . 
I won 't do it . 
So now you can go . 
Fuck you too . 
Tonight , you can stay here . 
Tomorrow , a taxi will take you to the airport . 
This is your ticket . 
Come here . 
I can 't , I have to go . 
Nico ? 
Nico went out . With Isabella , I think . 
I 'm happy they get along . 
She 's a good girl . 
That 's why I 'm not sure Nico 's company 's good for her . 
I 'll go , then . 
No . Why ? 
Maybe he 'll be back soon . 
Besides , I 'm alone tonight . 
Have a drink . Unless you have to run back to your boyfriend . 
Do you want me to stay ? 
Is this what you did when I wasn 't home ? 
What ? 
What 's wrong ? 
Let 's pretend nothing happened . 
I don 't recognize you . You 're different . 
I know . 
Do you love her ? 
- That 's why you want to send me away ? 
- Marina . 
You really think you can treat me like this ? Bastard . 
- Listen . 
- Who do you think you 're dealing with ? 
I really want to take care of you , and the baby . 
I 'm not fucking leaving . 
I 'm staying here . 
And you better shower me with money . Or I 'll tell the old hag who you are . 
I 'll give you what you want . 
But stay away from Gabriella . 
Do you understand ? 
She fell asleep , finally . 
Tell me . Is there another woman ? 
What do you mean ? 
I called the office today . You weren 't there . Where were you ? 
A woman from the office ? 
- The truth ? - Yes . 
- I was with my brother . 
He called to tell me stuff about Elia . 
I 'm looking into him again . 
I know I promised to let it go , but I can 't let my mother be fooled like that . 
She 's my mother . It 's my duty to protect her . 
I 'll do anything to save her from that con man . 
I 'd rather you had a lover . It would 've been more normal . 
- Where are you going ? 
- Sofia 's room . 
- Why ? - Because you pissed me off ! 
You 're so beautiful when you sleep . 
When did you come back ? 
A while ago . 
And where have you been ? 
I needed to think . 
I had to find a way to show you what I really feel . 
- Elia ... 
- Wait . 
Let me finish . 
I love you . 
I want to be with you . Only with you . 
Gabriella De Rosa . Will you marry me ?
