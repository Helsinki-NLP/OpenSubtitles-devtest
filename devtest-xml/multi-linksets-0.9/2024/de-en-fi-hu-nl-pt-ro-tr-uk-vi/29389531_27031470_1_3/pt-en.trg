Sooner or later they will stop . 
The guests must be here . 
They 'll be wondering where you are . 
My family must have arrived too . 
I want to be happy . 
That 's all . I 'm not asking you to understand . But to respect me . 
Elia is part of my life . 
And I asked him to move into the hotel with me . 
You 've all had your say . 
That 's enough . 
Now let me live . 
Is that what you got us all here for ? 
To say you 'll stay with him , and he 's moving in ? 
I can 't believe it . 
I had you come because the hotel reopens today . Which will one day be yours too . 
And I also wanted to make things clear . 
But things are clear . You 're the one who doesn 't want to see . 
You 're telling yourself a story that doesn 't exist , about a man who doesn 't exist . 
Do you think you know Elia better than I do ? 
You 've never given him a chance . 
I 'm trying to help you . 
But only you can help yourself , by freeing yourself from this obsession . 
Very well . 
Do you have anything to say ? 
I don 't give a damn . 
- You 're so pretty . 
- We have to leave . 
- Why now ? 
- Ester . 
Bye , Scotto . 
- Has something happened ? 
- Bye . 
- Come on , let 's go . 
- Yes , one second . 
Was it that bad ? 
It 's done . 
I 'm ready . 
No . 
Now you 're ready . 
You 're not coming ? 
This is your moment . Not mine . 
Go . They 're waiting for you . 
- Good morning , Mrs. Gabriella . 
- Good morning . 
So , let 's take a nice photo . 
Madam , right in the center . 
Give us a smile . 
Don 't move . 
Keep still . A little longer . 
A bit closer together , please . You too . 
- Nice view ? 
- Very . 
Your mother told me things didn 't go very well with you . 
It 's my fault . 
If you feel so guilty , why don 't you take a step back ? 
Giulia . My God , it 's so exciting . - I 'm live , can you say something ? 
- No , sorry . It 's not the time . 
Come on , one second . 
With your boyfriend too . 
No , Giulia 's busy now . She can 't . 
I 'm sorry . 
With your boyfriend too . 
HOW COOL ! 
No , Giulia 's busy now . She can 't . 
I 'm sorry . 
HOW DID YOU MEET EACH OTHER ? 
HE 'S MY MOTHER 'S BOYFRIEND 
YOUR MOTHER ROCKS ! 
WHEN WILL YOU FIND SOMEONE LIKE HIM ? 
It really was a nice day . 
But ? 
- I wanted to ask you something . 
When I met your mother , why did she tell me that you 're not a good person ? 
What did she mean ? 
Listen , Gabriella . 
I 've done things I 'm not proud of . You know that . 
But these are mistakes . 
They belong to the past . 
And they need to stay there . 
They don 't concern me anymore . 
Please , trust me . 
I 'm not that man any longer . 
I 'M NOT ENGAGED HE 'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND , STOP ! 
I DIDN 'T WANT TO BE PUSHY . BUT YOU 'RE GORGEOUS ! 
I 'D BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU WERE WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT 
SORRY , EVERYONE MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU 'RE GORGEOUS 
COOL 
WORKOUT ! 
MY PICTURES 
NO , I LIKE HEARING THAT 
I 'M QUITE VAIN 
HOW 'S IT GOING WITH ELIA ? 
STILL FAKE STRAIGHT ? TELL ME I 'M COMING OVER 
I moved my winter jackets . 
Ah . This is all I have anyway . 
I 've had to learn the art of minimalism . 
I hope you 'll stay here a little longer . 
I can stay forever , if you want me to . 
I 'm going to see where Nico is . 
Hi , darling . 
Nico , it 's okay to sneak off during the inauguration , but at least tell me when you go out . Okay ? 
Trouble . 
I told you ... not to get on the bed . 
Wait . 
Come here . 
You 're saying I shouldn 't care he 's moved into the hotel , that he 's playing boss , that he 's using her . 
That 's not what I 'm saying , but overreacting won 't fix things . 
My mother 's not what you think . 
When we were kids , bad things happened . 
It all started when Giulia was born . 
I was the only one who saw her like that . 
You never told me . 
I never told anyone . 
I wanted to protect her . 
- I 've been calling for an hour . 
This is Mattia Bonomo , a police officer we work with . 
- Hi . 
- Hi . 
Something serious happened with Sofia . 
Oh , the new machines are here . 
Excellent . I didn 't think it would be so fast . 
But now , guys , these need to be taken to the gym . 
Michele . 
Go ahead , Michele . 
Any other enlightening suggestions ? 
Do you like the staff uniforms ? 
Yes . But we could improve many other things . 
For example ? 
The restaurant , down on the beach . 
- It 's not really ... - That 's off limits . 
It 's the first thing Mr. Luigi built with his father . Before the hotel even existed . 
No one is allowed to ... 
What 's going on ? 
Nothing . 
A simple exchange of opinions . Right ? 
I 'll leave you to it . Okay , I 'm going . 
- Bye . - Bye . 
Scotto , Elia is my partner , and he should be listened to . 
Hi . 
- Okay , this is for you . 
- Yes . Thank you . 
- Hi . 
- Hi . 
So ? Are you done following me ? 
And ? Are you getting on , or just staying there ? 
Take off your shoes . 
If you want to stay , that 's fine . But you gotta help me . I need to fix up this boat to resell it . 
It might be faster with your help . 
What do you say ? Up for it ? 
- What should I do ? 
- Take your shirt off too . 
- What ? 
If you don 't want to ruin that , you better take it off now . 
We 'll get dirty . 
Oh , okay . 
It 's been going on for a month . 
The kid she 's writing to , Nelson , refuses to go to school . 
Believe me , I don 't understand . 
At home , she 's always so sweet . 
What do you know ? 
You 're never here . 
- And even when you 're here ... 
- What ? Say it . 
Your head isn 't there . 
You only think about your mother . 
- That 's not true . 
The principal asked me where she heard these words . 
" You 're a con man , you need to leave . " 
I worry about my family . 
You can 't fault me for that . 
We are your family . 
It 's us you need to worry about . 
Your mother doesn 't need you . 
Sofia does . 
I do . 
Good . Not bad for someone who doesn 't do shit in life . 
Let me help . 
What the fuck are you doing ? 
Oh , no . 
Well , I 'd say you 've earned your keep . 
- Shall we go for a sail ? 
- Yes . 
Okay . 
Let 's go . 
Here . 
You have to feel the waves , feel the sea , and then , little by little , you turn ... gently , the helm . 
Am I doing okay ? 
You were born at sea , and you don 't know how to sail ? 
That 's ridiculous . 
But I learn quickly , don 't I ? 
Look how well I drive . 
You mean " steer . " 
I steer . 
Anyway ... Yes . You 're not bad . 
If you weren 't a kid , I 'd bring you in on my rental business . 
- What rental business ? 
- I have a plan . 
I want to buy a few catamarans and rent them . 
You rent boats to clients , and they go where they want . 
You could come with me . 
No . My mother would never let me . 
You will be of age soon . 
It 's not a bad job to start with . 
- Are you kidding ? It 's a dream job ! 
- Then talk to her . 
Yeah . 
Well , the lesson is over for today . 
Come on . 
You did a good job . 
Let 's get back , before it gets dark . 
FRIEND REQUEST 
Who are you texting ? 
No , it 's ... just some girl . 
MARINA , ANSWER ME , WE NEED TO TALK ... WHERE ARE YOU ? 
So ? 
So , are we going back ? 
You go first . I 'll meet you there . 
Thanks for today . 
I had a really good time . 
Me too . 
- See you later . - Yes . 
The sea works up an appetite , eh ? 
I really liked the boat , you know ? 
Elia says I 'm talented . 
After only half a day on the boat ? 
He wants to start a charter service . 
I could help him , maybe go with him . 
And you could manage the financial side from here . 
Wow , that 'd be fun . 
Okay , Nico , come on . 
I 'm serious . 
I 'll think about it . 
- Hi . 
- Hi . 
You smell like sweat and dirt . 
I just finished working on the boat now . 
Sorry , I 'll take a shower . 
No , I like you like that . 
A few more weeks and the boat will be ready . 
Nico told me . 
He couldn 't stop talking about you at dinner . 
How skilled you are , how well you handle the boat , the beauty of life outdoors . 
At least he did something different . 
Was it your idea or his to come together on the charter project ? 
I 'm not judging . Just trying to understand . 
I haven 't seen him so happy in months . 
The call of the sea . 
No , it 's being with you . 
He 's getting to know you . Maybe he 'll understand why I love you . 
You love me , huh ? 
Must be my smell , then . 
Pheromones and sweat . 
Absolutely . 
It 's good for Nico to have something he 's passionate about . 
Something that brings him closer to us . 
WHY ARE YOU STILL AWAKE ? 
YOU 'VE BEEN GONE ALL DAY 
ARE YOU IGNORING ME ? 
SORRY , I HAD A FEW THINGS TO DO AND I GOT DISTRACTED HERE I AM ! 
OKAY , BUT DON 'T DO IT AGAIN , PLEASE 
I 'M GOING TO SLEEP , I 'M EXHAUSTED ! 
GOODNIGHT , A KISS ... 
There it is . That 's the boat we want . 
- That one ? 
- Yes , that one . 
When people know it 's for sale , they 'll run to buy it . 
We can 't pass this up , Nico . 
- With this , we 'd make it to the Maldives . 
- You can even get to Australia . 
- Come . - Good morning . 
Good morning . 
- Elia Marini , I guess . 
- Nice to meet you . 
- Thanks for the preview . - Next week , it 'll be up for sale . 
Since you 're an admirer and you bugged me , you 'll get to make an offer first . 
- I really don 't know how to thank you . 
- You have one week . 
Then it goes on the market , and I won 't be able to help . 
And you 'll have to fly to the Maldives . 
- I 'll show you the inside . Come in . - Let 's go . 
Hey , what are you doing ? 
We 'll take it ! 
What ? 
That fucking catamaran . It has to be ours . 
We have to go everywhere . Everywhere ! 
- Mr. Scotto is here . 
- Okay , let him in . 
- Good morning . 
- Good morning . 
I was waiting for you . 
What happened ? 
It 's about that man , Elia . 
I wouldn 't have come in person if it wasn 't so serious . That man is really pushing the limits . 
He wants to convince your mother to buy sailboats for a rental business . Charters . A charter service ? 
In the hotel ? Exactly . 
But that 's not all . He 's using your brother Nico to convince her . 
You have to do something , step in . 
Believe me , I 'm as worried as you are . But I want to stay out of my mother 's life . 
Then we are ruined . 
I 'M GOING CRAZY 
IT 'S CLEAR THAT ELIA IS INTO IT ... 
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO PUSH HIM ... 
Who are you texting ? The girl from the other day ? 
No . Just a classmate . 
Girls like you a lot , huh ? 
This weed sucks . 
Where do you get it ? 
I don 't smoke much . 
I get it wherever I can . 
Well , if we 're going to sail together , I 'll bring the weed , okay ? 
What are you doing ? 
What do you think ? 
Have you ever kissed anyone ? 
What are you saying ? 
I don 't think so . 
Just as I thought . 
Nico , I love your mother . 
Sure , of course you do . 
But I do . 
I 'm curious , though . 
How would you imagine a relationship between us ? 
Have you thought about it ? 
Come on . 
Fuck you ! 
Nico . 
- Nico ! - What do you want ? 
Do you want to wake up the whole hotel ? 
I don 't give a damn . 
Are you drunk ? Huh ? 
You 've been drinking . 
What do you care ? 
You only think about Elia . 
What 's the matter with you ? Huh ? 
It seemed to me that things were going better . 
With Elia too . 
Yeah . Indeed , things are going really well . 
With Elia too . 
In fact , things are going great with Elia , Mom . 
Elia ? Elia ? 
- Elia ! - Stop it . Stop it ! Nico ! What ? 
You want to know what the problem is ? It 's you . 
Without you , Elia and I would be together ! 
- We 'd sail away ... 
- You 're talking nonsense . 
Ask him . 
Mom , I kissed him last night . 
You kissed him ? What does that mean ? 
In what sense ? In the only possible sense , Mom . 
- You and him ... 
- You don 't believe me . 
- Darling . 
- " Darling " my ass , Mom ! 
You believe him ! You believe someone you 've just met , but not me , your son ! 
- What are you saying ? 
- He 's filling your head with bullshit ! 
He 's using you ! 
Go ask him . He even has a second phone . 
Ask him , come on ! 
I hate you ! 
Nico ! 
Elia ? 
- What 's wrong ? 
- What happened with Nico ? 
What ? 
I want to know what happened with my son . 
Did you two kiss ? Did you kiss him ? Okay . There was a kiss . 
What does it mean , " there was a kiss " ? 
Maybe it was my fault too . 
I didn 't realize he had feelings for me . 
I can 't believe it . 
We were talking in the garden . He grabbed me and kissed me . 
I swear I didn 't expect that . 
- I didn 't know what to do . 
- You just had to tell me about it . 
Yes , maybe . But put yourself in his shoes . 
Nico is a minor , and I 'm his mother . It 's up to me to decide . 
And you 're telling me you didn 't notice anything ? 
You 're a grown man . And you didn 't realize he had feelings for you ? 
I can 't trust you . 
Then don 't . 
And what 's this about a second phone ? 
If you 're talking about this ... 
Here . 
Why do you have a hidden second phone ? 
It was one of my first phones . There are texts I care about . That 's all . 
Here . Feel free to search through my dark secrets . 
I don 't need to . 
Bringing you here was a mistake . 
A hasty decision . 
I should have thought about my son . Realized that something was wrong . 
But I was distracted . 
Your children will always come between us . Right ? 
I 'll always be under scrutiny . The one who does wrong . 
While you , them ... 
God forbid . The perfect family . 
My family is not perfect . But it 's my family . 
Get out . 
Are you sure ? 
Is that really what you want ? 
Nico . It 's the tenth message I 'm leaving you . 
Why don 't you answer ? 
Come on , I 'm worried . Call me . 
Hello ? 
Mario . Sorry to bother you . 
Have you heard from Nico ? 
Is he with you ? 
No , sorry . He must be at school . It 's 11 , after all . 
No , he didn 't go to school . 
He left this morning . 
I don 't know where he went . 
- Call Stefano . 
- I called him already , he has no idea . 
Did something happen ? 
We had a fight . 
A bad one . 
Then he left . 
He got on his scooter , but ... he was drunk or high , I don 't know . I 'm worried . 
All right , calm down . I 'll come over now , and we 'll look for him together . 
Elia , I need to keep my phone line free . 
Nico isn 't back yet . 
- Hey , Nico . - Hi , Nico . 
- Wanna try ? 
- What is it ? 
See how it makes you feel . 
Drink it , Nico . Drink . 
Nico , close the door . 
ONE NEW MESSAGE 
I WANT TO MEET YOU ! WHERE ARE YOU ? 
Nothing , he 's not there . 
We looked for him everywhere . 
- Go if you want . Don 't worry about me . - He 's my son too , isn 't he ? 
Besides , I don 't feel like driving so late . 
I 'd rather wait for him here , that idiot . If you don 't mind . 
Shall I get you some herbal tea ? 
Herbal tea ? Whiskey . 
Thank you . 
Still nothing . 
Checking your phone every minute won 't make time go faster . 
I 'm cold . 
Relax , he 'll be back . 
Excuse me , do you know Nico Vasari ? 
No . 
Is this Nico 's dog ? 
Do you know him ? 
Yes , he invited me here , but I can 't find him . 
I think he left . 
He was really high . 
Maybe he went home . 
Nico , I feel guilty . 
Tell me where you are , I 'll join you . 
Nico . 
Look , Nico , I 'm sorry . I apologize , okay ? 
I was an asshole to you . 
The thing is , sometimes , I don 't realize things . 
- I should 've realized that you ... - Stop it . You knew . 
- You just jerked me around . - Maybe a bit , yes . 
But I didn 't mean to hurt you . 
And , you know , it 's not an easy thing to manage . 
What ? 
Your lover 's faggot son ? 
News flash , I 'm not gay . 
I like girls . Mostly girls . 
I mean , I like guys too , sometimes . 
Basically , I 'm interested in people , I don 't care about gender . 
- Okay . 
- You think it 's funny ? 
I fucking don 't . 
But I 've figured you out . I know you would 've been into it . 
You can jerk my mother around with that good-guy act . But not me . 
Nico . You are 17 . 
Now you hate me . And you 've created this narrative of our impossible love story . 
But believe me , soon there will be someone else . And you will forget all of this . 
In fact , we 'll laugh about it . 
Don 't ever do that again . You must never do that to me again . 
Trouble ... - I lost him . - We 'll find him again . 
What a moron . 
No , don 't say that . 
Well ... 
You were a bit of a moron . 
Thank you . 
Well , in a few hours , I 'll have to be at work . 
You 're back in one piece . So ... 
Wait , Dad . 
I 'm coming with you . 
I don 't want to live with them . 
What are you saying , Nico ? 
You heard me . 
- I 'm going to live with Dad . 
- No need . I 'll leave . 
I 'm okay with that . You can stay with me as long as you like . 
Please , Nico . 
I 'll get my things . 
He 'll be back , you 'll see . I know it . 
Mrs. Gabriella , someone 's here for you . 
Trouble ! 
Oh God , I really don 't know how to thank you . 
Where did you find him ? 
Your son invited me to a party in Naples . But when I got there , I only found the dog . 
I read the address on the collar . And I got a ride here . 
Nico was devastated . 
Hey , I missed you , you know ? 
- Thank you so much . - Cutie . It was nothing . 
Bye , little one . 
I 'll go now . 
How will you get back to Naples ? 
Actually , I 'm staying here a few days . 
Let me at least offer you breakfast . 
- Okay , thanks . 
- I 'm Gabriella . 
Marina . 
I 'll check if someone 's here already . 
What are you doing here ? 
I really missed you . 
I couldn 't wait any longer . 
You can 't stay here . 
Come on , I 'll contact you . 
Ah , there we go . You 've already met ? 
I was introducing myself . 
Marina . 
Elia . 
She brought our dog back . 
Look , thank you for breakfast , but I 'm very tired . 
I should be going . I still need to find a hotel , and ... 
Why don 't you stay here ? 
There 's a beach , a pool ... 
I wish . But I can 't afford it . 
You will be my guest . A way for me to pay you back . 
Okay , thanks . How can I say no ? Great . Come . I 'll have someone take you to your room .
