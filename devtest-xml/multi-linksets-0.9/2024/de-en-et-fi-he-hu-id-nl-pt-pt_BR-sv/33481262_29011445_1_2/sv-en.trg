Sweetie , can you take this ? 
What 's this ? 
Tranquilizers , just in case she gives us any trouble . 
You really think that 's necessary ? 
Well , that will be up to her , won 't it ? 
- Oh , gosh . I 'm sorry . 
- Why don 't you watch out ? 
No , no , no , no , no . 
- There you go . - Stop it ! Stop it . Stop it . 
In 2004 , the journalist Gwen Ifill coined the term " Missing White Woman Syndrome . " 
It 's basically about the whole world goes crazy when a pretty white girl disappears . 
Not that I 'm saying I 'm pretty . 
And then you have the people that the world never takes notice of . 
Watch out . 
The nerds . 
Pretty sweet wheels , huh ? 
- Do you live around here ? - Yeah . 
Is it always this strange ? 
Is there anywhere I can order a flat white without being forced to drink cow 's milk like we 're still in the Stone Age ? 
Bella 's on Main Street . 
Thanks , hon . 
No problem . 
Who was that girl you were just talking to ? 
No idea . 
- You 're pretty early . - Yeah . 
- Excited about the game ? - Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
Do you want anything to drink ? 
I 'll have a Coke , please . 
Your old man is inside with Karl . 
Should I put it on his tab ? 
- Should I tell him that you 're out here ? 
- I 'd rather not . 
How are things going with you , huh ? 
Do you have a girlfriend yet ? 
Anyone in sight ? 
Look out , girls ! 
Coke is on its way . 
SV Sundersheim , SV Sundersheim ! 
Thanks . 
Now I get why Ole agreed to go to all those soccer games with Dad . 
The problem is , if you spend your life flying under the radar , when you finally do want to be noticed , it 's not that easy . 
So , do you already have your tickets for Games World ? 
Bro , I 'm broke . 
Dude , get your shit together . ShadowStrike is hosting a tournament . 
It 's gonna be sick . 
I don 't have the money right now . 
- Sweetie , are you ready ? - Yes . 
- You gonna be online tomorrow ? - Probably yeah . 
- Apex at 5 : 00 ? - Okay . 
- We 'll text , all right ? 
- Yeah , sure . 
- What 's up , dude ? 
- All good ? 
What are you looking at ? 
They say love always finds a way , but it doesn 't hurt to jump-start it a bit . 
In this video , I will show you how to pick a lock . 
Slowly insert your tool into the keyhole ... 
I think we should start here at the clothes bin in the center and then spiral out . 
The one good thing about having a meltdown on TV is that work was very happy to offer me a 30-day sabbatical to recover . 
Ha ! Did it . 
What about you ? Did you ask about getting the time off yet ? 
Yeah . All good . 
Good . 
Now I 'll number the rest of the houses right up to the line , and then we 'll start here at number two . 
- At the Tannenring . - Okay . 
- Ole , hey . 
What 's up , Ole ? 
- Ole . 
What are you doing down here ? 
- Just fixing something . 
- We 're playing ping-pong . Right , exactly . I was fixing something . - Now , we are playing ping-pong . Yes . - Yes . I 'm winning . 
Sure . Okay . 
I need a ticket for Games World . 
I see . And what is " Games World " ? 
It 's a computer games conference . Can I go ? 
I see , and how much are the tickets ? 
- 200 euros . 
- 200 euros ? 
I thought the point of computer games was was that you could play at home ? 
Dad , you don 't understand . 
What ? 
200 euros . 
My first car cost less than that . 
- You don 't get it . 
- I do get it . 
On the phone you said you knew who abducted Wanda Klatt ? 
On Nuppelwocken Night , yes . 
I saw them with my own eyes . 
I was in the woods ... wassailing with the trees , renewing my spiritual defenses , and all of a sudden ... there he was ... Majestic . 
I did a painting for you . In case it 's useful . 
You painted that yourself ? 
- Fantastic . Truly . - Thank you . 
Excellent use of time . 
- Thanks . 
- You are welcome . 
The next Nuppelwocken tour starts at 1 : 15 . 
These TV appeals always bring the crazies out . 
Why is everyone so obsessed with this thing ? 
With the Nuppelwocken ? 
Well , it 's our history . 
You know that 's not history , right ? 
Fine , legend then . 
All right , we start right here . 
Here at the clothes bin , and then we 'll search one by one . 
Let 's just go over the plan one more time . 
Dedo , this is serious . 
Okay . All right . 
So , I ring the bell . Check if the house is empty . If it is , I 'll try to get in through ... 
Ole changed my text alert . He thought it was hilarious . Now , I don 't know how to change it back . 
Yeah , it 's from Ole . 
About this Games World thing again . 
Hey , buddy . 200 euros is a lot of money . 
Send . 
Yeah , thanks . Well , I ... Can you hold this a second ? 
He says , " ShadowStrike is hosting a tournament , and it 's gonna be a bad ass . " 
Sorry , " badass . " 
Who is ShadowStrike ? 
Not " Cellostrike " . 
Sh ... Sh-ShadowStrike . 
Send . 
Do you think maybe we could try and focus ? 
I am . 
Honey , we got this . 
Listen . I 'll go to the house . Check if it 's empty . Pick the lock . Look around inside . 
And if someone comes , you honk the horn and I 'll get out . 
Ready ? 
Ready . 
All right , my friend . Let 's do this . 
You shitting shit ! 
Why are you so shitty ? 
Damn it ! 
Carlotta ? 
Rüdiger ? 
What are you doing here , Sis ? 
What are you doing here ? 
I live around the corner . 
Right . 
Saw you on TV yesterday . 
Everything okay ? 
Everything is great . 
Just ... it was pretty ... 
- Well ... 
- What ? 
Intense . 
Thanks for checking in , Rüdiger . 
Always nice to see you . 
Dodo looked like such a dum-dum on his tiny stool . 
Don 't call him that . 
What ? 
Dodo or dum-dum ? 
I know you 're still mad at him , but ... 
He set the cops on me ! Well , yes , that was unfortunate , but ... 
Unfortunate ? Carlotta , he said , and I quote , that I have " major pedo vibes . " 
He was exhausted . 
And he was angry at you for talking to that journalist lady . 
I didn 't know she was a journalist . 
Her Tinder profile said pastry chef . 
- She totally messed with me . - Sh ... Carlotta ? 
I can follow up on the rest of the Wanda leads myself . No need to waste your time . 
Do you know how an oyster works ? 
They 're filter feeders , so they suck in all the crap , and they filter out everything that is not useful . 
But every now and then a grain of sand is caught inside ... and that 's when you find a pearl . 
Is this a metaphor ? 
Yes . 
What the hell are you doing ? 
I dropped my keys . 
They 're in the ignition . 
Damn it , open up ! 
If Dodo wants to repair the relationship , then he needs to apologize . 
Okay , fine , I 'll talk to him . 
I 'll talk to him , yeah ? 
Wait up . 
- I know him . 
- Who ? 
He 's a teacher at Wanda 's school . 
That guy 's a teacher ? 
What does he teach ? Steroids ? 
Oh , shit . Oh , shit . 
Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? 
There was a family of ducks crossing the street . 
You 're parked ! 
I 'm an animal rights activist ! 
You 're really starting to worry me , Carlotta . 
Hey ! What are you doing here ? 
You looking for trouble ? 
Carlotta ! 
Start the car ! Start the car ! 
- Are you okay ? - Go , go , go ! 
Now , now , now , now ! 
What happened to you ? 
I tripped . Over a dog . 
Where were you guys ? 
- Bowling . 
- Shopping . 
Okay , what is going on here ? 
Two days ago , you show up saying Mom 's been bitten by a snake . 
Now you look like you 've been hit by a truck and you 're saying you fell over a dog in a bowling alley . 
It 's about Wanda , isn 't it ? 
You always say families don 't lie to each other . 
So tell the truth . 
Okay . 
Someone put Wanda 's T-shirt into a clothes donation bin here . 
Why would they pick this particular bin ? 
Unless they were still nearby , right ? 
Statistically speaking , the odds of finding Wanda drop after the first 100 days . 
What day is today ? 
- Day 70 . 
- Seventy . 
So your Mother and I have decided that , in the next 30 days , we will do everything in our power to find her . 
We think Wanda is being held in one of these houses . 
So ... So we 're searching them . 
You 're planning to break into all these houses ? 
We already did two . 
So that 's only another ... 
- Just like another 60 . - Sixty . 
Sixty ? 
Look at yourselves . 
And that 's after two houses . 
You try another 60 and you 'll either end up in prison , in a mental hospital or in a cemetery . 
Ole , we don 't know what else to do . 
You really think we could find Wanda ? 
Fine . 
But you need to stop being such boomers about it . 
Bug them . Digital surveillance . 
Be smart . And don 't get caught . 
Promise ? 
Okay , well , I appreciate your honesty . 
I feel like we 've reached a new level of trust ... as a family . 
As such , I will take it that I have your blessing to go to Games World . 
Good talk . 
- That was good . 
- That ... That was ... 
- That cost us 200 euros . - Yeah . 
Hey . I finally got a hold of someone about the surveillance camera - at the donation bin . - And ? 
The security service says the memory card gets overwritten every six days because the boss gave the spare card to his daughter to take on her gap year . 
What do you have there ? 
Just an old Beetle . 
A few people noticed it on the day Wanda went missing . 
B-L-B . Where is that supposed to be ? 
Bad Berleburg . In North Rhine-Westphalia . 
I did an owner search , but no hits . 
Maybe they got the license plate wrong ? 
Very likely . 
The people here don 't seem to get many things right . 
Take a look at this for me . 
Several statements about a black van seen driving erratically . 
Will do . 
Hello . 
Can I help you with something ? 
We just wanted to ... Well , we 're looking for recording devices . 
So like video recorders or microphones ? 
Yes , exactly . 
What do you want to do with them ? 
- Make a podcast . 
- Watch birds . 
We like to watch birds in our yard . 
But then all of a sudden we noticed they were dying . - Dying , yes . - So we 're looking for something to monitor our yard . 
Right , and I 'm gonna make a podcast about it . 
Got it . I have just the thing . 
This is a standard wildlife camera . 
It works with a motion detector . 
When it goes off , it records an image onto the memory card , which you can then easily view on your computer . 
Do you have anything that can be watched remotely ? 
Sure , but it means we start moving up the price range . 
- No problem . - No problem . 
What 's the best you have ? 
The best ? 
Ultra HD , 32-bit color depth , 20-meter wireless range . 
This baby here is the Rolls-Royce of surveillance cameras . 
Do you have anything ... smaller ? 
Sure . 
This one . The XR-098 . 
We meant a lot smaller . 
Oh , you mean like a bug ? 
Well , to be honest , that stuff 's a bit more specialized , and kind of illegal . 
But there is one thing . 
It says here , " Directional microphones were used for espionage during World War II . " 
So why was it in the toy section ? 
Just ... point the thing towards the house and we 'll see what happens , okay ? 
Okay , can you hear me ? 
Loud and clear ! 
Great ! 
Yes , great ! 
So as long as the kidnappers open their front door and scream directly at us , we 'll be fine ! 
You 're being sarcastic . 
I 'll go inside . 
Okay , can you hear me ? 
Testing , one , two , three , four . 
One , two , three , four . 
I 'm going up the stairs . 
Testing , testing , testing . 
Really ? That 's awesome ! 
Okay , I 'm going back down the stairs . Into the kitchen . 
I repeat , into the kitchen . 
Delta one to Charlie one . The bird has landed . 
I repeat , the bird has landed . 
Okay , moving over here . Can you still hear me ? 
I 'm in Wanda 's room now . 
Wow . I haven 't been here for a while . 
I 'm sitting on her bed . 
This is where I read her all the Harry Potter books . 
Three times . 
She would get so mad when I didn 't do all the voices . But there were a lot of voices . 
By Prisoner of Azkaban , I was really scraping the barrel . 
I miss her so much . 
I miss all the dumb tiny things . 
The way she rolled her eyes when I told a joke , but still had a grin on her face . 
I miss how she would give me this look when you were telling me off . 
Like she was trying to make me laugh to get me into even more trouble . 
And I miss you too . 
- Okay , next house . 
You listening ? - I 'll hold it steady . - Okay . 
- Okay . - Ready ? 
- It 'll be great . - Okay . 
A little further to the right . 
Slowly , slowly . 
Yes . 
There 's a dog ... that sounds like your cousin 's ankle biter . 
Okay . 
Continue ? 
Yes , okay ... a little further left . 
Further . 
Stop . Stop ! 
Okay . I hear something . 
I hear a TV . 
It 's ... Yep . 
I think ... I 'm pretty sure it 's one of the Fast and Furiouses . 
- Dedo , do you really think that now ... - Wait ! Stop . 
I don 't have friends , I got family . 
I 'm pretty sure it 's Furious 6 . 
- My turn . - Ouch ! 
That was actually very irresponsible . 
Wow . You could have burst my eardrums . 
I remember , back at school , Helmut Roder was standing behind Mr. Matthäus 's car and bang , misfire . 
It back-fired and he lost all hearing in his left ear . 
He had to wear an ear patch it looked ridiculous it was awful , everyone made fun of him . 
Mom will pick you up later . Okay . 
See you later . 
Alex ? 
Have fun . 
Sorry ! Sorry . 
- I 'm sorry . 
- Wait . 
No problem , I wasn 't looking where I was going . Thanks . 
Wow . You 're going to Games World ? Yeah . 
ShadowStrike is hosting a tournament . 
I heard that too . 
ShadowStrike is fire . 
You 're a gamer ? 
- Yeah , 100 % . 
- Sweet . We should play together ! 
My buddy Chris and I game all the time . We could use a third man . Yes ? 
Really ? 
Awesome . 
I mean , yeah , of course , if you need a third guy . I 'm in . 
Nice , nothing better than smoking weed and shooting NPCs , right ? 
- For sure . 
- Do you smoke ? 
Oh , yeah , big time . I love " living the high life , " right ? 
I just got some crazy shit off the dark web . 
You should come over and try it sometime . 
You got a pen ? 
Okay , so that 's ... my gamer tag . 
I 'll be online tonight , after 7 : 00 . 
Add me , yeah ? 
I don 't know what to do . 
- She 's refusing to eat . 
- What ? 
The man just said , " She 's refusing to eat . " 
- Who refu ... 
- Well , we have to force her . 
Unless you want her to starve ? 
And now the woman says they have to force her . 
You know that too . 
Oh , my God . 
Bunny , she won 't do it . She said she won 't eat ... 
- He says she 'll only ... - ... until she 's allowed out of the room . 
He says she will only eat when she is allowed to leave the room . 
Maybe we should let her out a bit . Just to the kitchen . 
I don 't care , she can 't leave . 
What if someone sees her ? 
What if we just let her out for a moment to stretch her legs ? 
She 's been locked up for weeks . 
No , she stays in there . End of discussion . 
- What are you doing ? 
- I 'm going in . 
- You can 't just storm in there . 
- They 're holding someone captive ! 
What are you going to say ? 
" Sorry , we were just eavesdropping on you and we think you might have our daughter . " Carlotta ! 
We promised Ole that we would be smarter about it . 
We need bugs . 
We need your help , please . As the saying goes : if you need something illegal done on the Internet , ask a teenager . 
- Hello . 
- Hello . 
I 'm Ole , a friend of Alex . 
Is he here ? 
Yes . 
Why don 't you come in ? 
Alex ! 
- Would you like something to drink ? 
- Yes , thank you . 
- Alex ! 
- Coming ! 
- Thank you . - Sorry to ask , but aren 't you Wanda Klatt 's brother ? 
It 's awful what you 're all going through right now . 
It must be just terrible . 
I do not understand why the Schusters insist on making Inga take ballet lessons . 
I know she 's only six , but the girl 's a dump truck . 
I mean , are they giving her protein shakes in her lunch box ? 
Jonas , this is Ole . 
Wanda Klatt 's brother . 
Ole . 
Hello . 
Pleasure . 
I used to teach Wanda , a long , long time ago . 
She was a little sparkle . 
I think I even have a picture here somewhere ... Ah , yes ! There she is . 
Rizzo , 2009 Grease Mega-mix . 
So much potential . 
- Alex ! - Yes . 
But , as Katarina always tells me ... I can 't keep them all . 
- Ole . 
- Hi . 
What 's up ? 
The other day you mentioned the dark web . 
Can you show me ? 
Welcome to the Black Souk . 
Drugs , weapons , super-weird porn . 
I even saw someone selling a tiger on here once . 
Whatever you 're looking for , you can find it here . 
So , what do you need ? 
Quantex MF-317 . 
Quantex ... M , F , 3 , 1 . 
What 's that ? 
They 're surveillance cameras . 
Okay ... My mom thinks that my dad is cheating on her . 
Sorry . 
My dad cheated , back when we were six . 
Yeah . I don 't think my parents know that we know , but it was pretty messed up . 
He had to live with my grandma and grandpa for a month . 
He begged my mom to take him back . 
Yeah , since then he 's basically been her bitch . 
Running around after her like a puppy . He 's super scared she 'll divorce him and take everything . It 's kind of sad . 
I am so sorry . 
Do you know the woman your dad had an affair with ? 
Yeah , his name was Frederik . 
Here it is ! 
Oh , dude , they cost 600 euros each . 
Oh , no worries . 
My mom gave me her credit card . 
That 's no good here . 
It 's all crypto . 
Do you have a Bitcoin wallet ? 
No . 
Too bad . 
Wait , wait , wait . 
If you help me , I 'll give you five percent commission . 
Really ? 
Okay . 
Back to business , my friend . 
First we have to set up an account for you . 
- Hello ? 
- Hello , I 'm Father Schäfer . 
I am a man of the cloth , but I had a crisis of faith . However , I 'm also the best damn exorcist 
- this side of the Va ... - Stop . 
What ? 
We agreed we weren 't doing the Father Schäfer thing . 
Well , I just thought ... Dad , no . 
Mom 's right . It 's lame . 
Fine . Then I 'll just say ... Hello , my car just broke down and my cell phone is dead . 
Could I please make a quick call ? 
- Much better . - Much better . 
And once you 're in , you just have to get him out of the room somehow and then install the bug . 
That 's the camera . 
- Right . - You need to point it at the target . 
- Got it ? - No biggie . 
Thanks . 
Oh , yes , right . 
Eight , three , zero ... The number you have dialed is not in service . 
Yes ? Hello ? I 'm calling because my car broke down . 
... currently not available . 
My name ? 
My name is ... Father Schäfer . 
Good . 
Thanks . 
I 'll wait . 
This might take a while . 
Just a bit dry . 
Ahem . Excuse me . 
- Could I get a glass of water ? - Of course . - Yes , thank you . 
- Excuse me . 
Come on , come on . 
Come on , come on . 
What are you doing ? 
Me ? 
I had a ... So , I actually just wanted to ... I 'm ... 
There 's a room with a padlock on it . 
- What did you say ? 
- I said you have a very nice house . 
Shit . 
CAN YOU GET IN ? I don 't think so . 
Everything all right ? 
I 'm just having a poo ! 
The wife is onto me . 
What did he say ? 
" I don 't think so I 'm just having a poo the wife is onto me . " 
" The wife is onto me . " 
It 's working . 
Both cameras are online . 
I told you not to let any strangers inside the house . 
I think he 's a priest . 
He doesn 't look like a priest . 
Got you . 
What ? 
You can 't park here . 
I 'm just waiting for my husband . I see . 
But there is absolutely no stopping here between 9 : 00 a.m. and 7 : 00 p.m. 
So please remove your vehicle immediately . 
Otherwise I 'll have it towed . 
Towed ? But I 'm in it . 
What if someone sees you park here and thinks , " Oh , how convenient . I didn 't even know you were allowed to park there . " 
And then he tells his friends , and those friends tell their friends . 
And all of a sudden it 's car-mageddon . 
I would therefore kindly ask you to remove your vehicle from the no-stopping zone immediately . 
And seat belts next time ! 
Right . 
Bless you in the name of ... What a waste of time . 
- Sweetie ? I 'm going shopping . - I 've seen her before . 
I was just wondering ... as things are looking a little tight this month , perhaps we could go easy on the shopping ? 
That 's his wife ? 
Don 't you want your little bunny to be happy ? 
Of course I want my bunny to be happy . 
Shopping . Shopping makes your bunny happy . 
- Good little mole . 
Give me the card . - Please . 
Bye . 
Okay , now what ? 
We have to wait until one of them opens the door . 
We can take shifts . 
Why is the guy with the blue face following me ? 
Dad , chill , it 's me . 
I 'm trying to help you . 
Everything okay ? 
The door . He 's opening the door . He 's opening the door ! 
- What ? 
- He is opening the door ! 
There 's a food tray . 
There 's definitely someone inside . 
Oh , my God . 
Can you see anything ? 
Okay , you can come out for a little bit . 
We 're all alone . 
- Who 's that ? 
- Is that Wanda ? 
It doesn 't look like Wanda . 
Who is it ? 
You better behave yourself . 
If Anita finds out she 'll be very mad . 
What did he say ? 
" Anita will be very mad " or something like that ? 
That 's why that woman looked so familiar to me ! 
She works in the hospital as a palliative care nurse . 
What ? I don 't get it . 
So the chick from before is shacking up with the old one , and keeping his real wife locked up . 
Why ? 
I don 't know , they must be collecting her care allowance or ... 
Don 't try anything . We 're all alone . 
- We have to call the police , right ? - No . 
If we call the police , they 'll know we planted the bug . We could get in big trouble . 
Then we 'll never find Wanda . 
But we can 't just leave her there . 
What are we going to do now ? 
- It 's eights . 
- What ? 
On the license plate of the Beetle . 
8L8 , not BLB . 
It is not from Berleburg , it 's from the Czech Republic . 
Czech Republic ? Okay . 
And you think this has something to do with Wanda Klatt ? 
No idea , but I 'm going to find out . 
The police sent someone to do a welfare check on Mrs. Hessel . 
But you didn 't tell them your name ? 
No , of course not . I said I 'm a concerned neighbor . 
Mom . Dad . 
I 'm sorry it wasn 't her . 
Yeah . Me too . 
Did you ever play hide and seek as a child and were super excited because you thought you had found the best hiding place in the world ? 
And then at some point you panicked because the hiding place was so good ... that maybe no one would ever find you ? 
There you are . 
So at some point you deliberately give yourself away . 
" Monster Hunting in Sundersheim . " 
Because the beauty of the game is not actually hiding ... 
- Wanda . - ... but ...
