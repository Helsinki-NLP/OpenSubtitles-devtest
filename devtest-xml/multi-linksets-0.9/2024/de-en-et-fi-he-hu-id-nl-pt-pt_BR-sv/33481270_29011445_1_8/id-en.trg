They say before you die , your whole life flashes before your eyes . 
I 've often wondered what that must be like . 
I mean , who puts together the highlight reel ? 
I mean , my whole life ? 
Like , before I die , am I gonna have to watch myself pee my pants onstage , during our fifth-year school play ? 
I think I 'd rather just skip to the end . 
11 HOURS EARLIER Wanda ! 
No , no , no ! 
No , no , no , no , no ! 
Damn it ! 
Wanda ! 
No ! 
Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , no . 
Okay . 
What ? 
No ! 
No ! No , no , no ! 
Okay . 
Oy , oh , God . 
Damn it . 
Stop messing around ! 
I haven 't had enough coffee to deal with your crap . 
Pull your heads out of your asses and let 's go . 
We get through this in an hour and a half . 
It 's not witchcraft . Just step it up , for real . I 'm not gonna say this again . Let 's go . 
OPERATION SPRING CLEANING Okay ... So Wanda Fest is scheduled to start at 1200 hours . 
Depending on traffic conditions and general delays ... let 's assume people will be leaving their houses between eleven-thirty hundred and ... wait no ... one thousand , one hundred and thirty ... - Between 11 : 30 and 11 : 45 . - Right . Rüdiger , you and I will be at the event , keeping an eye on the neighbors , whilst Dedo and Ole ... Team Takeaway . 
... will be removing the bugs . 
Is that one of my knitting needles ? 
For this to work , we will have to function like a well-oiled machine . 
Any questions ? 
- What ? - What 's our team called ? 
Carlotta and Rüdiger . 
Ole , you 'll be watching the bugs from here , making sure the houses are empty and telling me which ones to hit next . 
We 'll communicate using these . 
Why don 't we just use our phones ? 
Because I need to keep the line free so Mom can reach me . 
Besides , this is way cooler . 
No , we don 't have walkie-talkies . 
Guys , we can do this if we work as a team . 
We 're not a team . 
We 're a family . 
You guys are so lame . 
- Operation Spring Cleaning . - Hey ! 
- Good luck . 
I ... I love you . 
I love you too . 
I love you too , Dedo . 
Answer the phone ! 
Robert Bauscher , station seven . How can I help you ? 
Hi , I would like to please speak to Chief Inspector Rauch , from the Wanda Klatt task force . 
Yes , one moment , please . 
Call for Rauch about Wanda Klatt . 
Is she here ? 
One second . 
Sorry , are you busy ? 
Trying to figure out who the hell this " King " is . 
There 's a call for you about Wanda Klatt . 
Can you take care of it ? 
Sure . 
Thanks . 
I 'll take it . 
Hello ? 
Ms. Rauch ? No , sorry . I 'm afraid Detective Rauch is busy at the moment . 
Can I help you ? 
I 'm her partner . 
Hello ? 
I 'm Wanda Klatt . 
Are you okay ? 
Let 's do it . 
Mic check . Mic check . 
One , two , one . 
- This has to go . - Wanda . 
The stage needs to be clear for the performances . 
The buffet tables are over there . 
Magdalena , leave enough space for everybody , please ? 
No hogging the tables with those monster quiches of yours . 
- There 's our guest of honor ! 
Hello . - Katarina . 
I expect today is going to be a little overwhelming for you all , but just know we 're all here for you . 
- Thank you . 
- Are Ole and Dedo here ? 
They 'll join a bit later . 
Ole was feeling a little under the weather this morning , so Dedo 's stayed with him . 
Oh , right , but this is my brother Rüdiger . 
- Enchanté . 
- My pleasure . 
Oh , nice , that 's the stage . 
Cool , cool . Is there someone I could speak to about the running order ? 
I have a little number I 'd like to perform . 
Katarina , is there anything else we can help you with ? 
No , you just get a drink , relax . 
We have everything under control . I better just go check on Magdalena . One moment . 
Magdalena ? I told you - not to put the quiche in the middle . 
- Wanda . 
Wanda Klatt . 
Eagle to Sparrow . Eagle to Sparrow . Can you hear me ? Over . 
Dad , how many times ? 
It 's just you and me . We don 't need code names . 
Can you please say " over ? " Over . What ? 
When you finish talking , you should say " over , " so I know you 've finished talking . 
Can 't I just finish talking ? 
Hey . And ? 
Hi . Guests are starting to arrive . 
How are you getting on ? 
So far , so good . Two down . Just in position outside house number seven . 
- Yeah . 
Hi . - Are you okay ? 
Yes . 
I don 't think I ever actually took a moment to think about what this whole thing would feel like . 
It 's a lot . 
I get it . 
DEAR WANDA , WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU ! WE THINK ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY . - I 'm sorry you have to do it alone . 
It feels like a goodbye . 
Honey , you can 't think like that . 
We 're not giving up . But we might not get another chance like this . 
Yes . Yes , you 're right . 
I 'm being silly . 
I just wish you were here with me . 
Movement at the Mullets . 
I repeat , movement at the Mullets . 
Go , go , go . 
Honey , I 've got to go . 
You got this . Okay ? - Yes . I 'll be fine . 
- Over . Okay , well , good luck ... Just moved in , we have to ... 
Come on . 
Come on . Come on . 
And stop . 
You want us to start unloading these boxes , boss ? 
Yeah , let 's get it done . 
Okay . Let 's go , boys ! 
Hi , this is Chris . 
Leave a message after the beep . 
Hey , Chris , I need you to talk to me . 
I 'm freaking out here , man . 
You don 't understand these people I work for . 
If they find out she is still alive ... Hello ? 
Hey , it 's Lukas . 
Look , there 's something I need to talk to you about . 
Yes , I need to talk to you too . 
But we can 't talk on the phone . 
I 'll meet you at your place . 
Wanda Klatt ? 
Who are you ? 
Police Inspector Schellenberg . 
Can I see your badge ? 
Of course . 
Okay . 
Okay , you need to listen to me , okay ? 
There are people after me , very dangerous people . 
I have information about someone called The King . 
- King ? 
- Yes . Yes , I think he runs a secret wildlife smuggling gang or something . 
Anyway , there was this journalist called Lenka Němcová , and she was about to expose him on her channel , so he had her killed by a guy named Lukas Novak . 
Do you need to be writing this down ? 
I 'll remember . 
Keep going . 
Yeah , so Lukas works for this woman called Brauer . She runs the Kapitän . 
Anyway , I saw the murder . 
So then , they wanted to kill me too . 
But the guy who was supposed to do it turned out to be a really sweet guy . 
And he hid me in his grandma 's basement . 
So I don 't want ... Well , I don 't want him to get in any trouble . 
But right now , he 's in danger , and I 'm in danger , and my family 's in danger . 
- So we need to find King and arrest him . - Wow . 
You really figured out a lot , huh ? 
Yes . 
So , what 's the plan ? 
Well , we need to get you to a safe house first . 
Then I 'll call my boss . She 'll know what to do . 
- Everything 's going to be all right . 
- Okay . - Yes . 
- Everything 's going to be all right . 
Okay , another one done . Off to the next one . Over . Okay , got it . 
You don 't understand . 
Look , I can tell you about it sometime , but not now . 
I don 't care . I 'm leaving . 
- I 'm so sick of this crap . 
- Sarah , where are you going ? 
Are you seriously doing this now ? 
Let 's at least talk about it first . 
I 'm done talking . 
You don 't understand the kind of pressure I 'm under . 
Pressure ? 
From what ? Soccer ? Or playing gangster ? 
Grow up . 
Sarah . Sarah ! 
Damn it . 
- Take that , loser ! - Fine , go on then . 
Bugger off ! 
How are you ? 
I 'm good . 
They 're very expressive . 
I 'm sorry . My husband can get a bit carried away . 
It 's very sweet . 
Thank you , Sparkles , intermediate modern class ! 
Let 's go . 
Chop chop , chop chop . 
Jonas ! 
- Unbelievable ! - And now I would like to invite my wonderful wife to the stage . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . 
First of all , I just want to say how grateful we all are that you all came out here today to support this incredibly important cause . 
In a moment , I 'll hand you over to one of the bravest women I know . 
But first , I would like to say a few words . 
What happened to the Klatt family has shaken this town to the core . 
As the mother of two children myself , it has left me deeply disturbed that a young woman like Wanda could just disappear without a trace . 
And what particularly concerns me , is how this family , and our community , have been let down by those in charge . 
And that 's why I have made the decision , in memory of Wanda , to run for mayor of Sundersheim in the upcoming elections . 
Bravo ! 
- I pledge to return this town ... 
- Did you know that ? 
- ... to the community it once was . 
- No . A community where you can rely on your neighbors , where people look out for each other . 
A community where our children can play safely in the streets , where families don 't have to be afraid of being torn apart by crime and uncertainty . 
That 's the Sundersheim I want to live in . 
A Sundersheim we can all be proud of . 
Thank you very much . 
But please , today is not about me . 
So to remind us what we are all here for , please welcome to the stage a woman I am proud to call a dear friend : Carlotta Klatt . 
Hello . 
Thank you all for being here . 
And thank you so much to ... to Katarina , and ... and Jonas , and Alex , and Lucie for ... for putting this all together . 
It 's really quite overwhelming . 
Everyone who 's seen me on TV will know that I 'm not great at public speaking . 
So I wrote something down . 
" Wanda . 
Tonight at midnight , my daughter Wanda ... will have been missing for 100 days . 
After this , the chances of finding her alive again are said to be less than 10 % . " 
That 's the safe house ? 
Come on . 
- You 're hurting me . - Come . 
- It 's me , Schellenberg . 
- Shit . 
Open up ! 
Wanda Klatt ... is alive . 
- No ! No ! 
Help ! 
- Get in there . 
No ! No ! 
Okay , Eagle en route to house 35 . 
Over . 
Looks like house 35 ... Sorry , you cut out . Can you say that again ? 
Over . 
Shut up . Be quiet ! Wanda ? 
Sparrow , you still there ? 
Over . She 's alive ! 
Dad , Wanda 's alive ! 
Wanda ? 
Ole , are you 100 % sure it 's her ? 
I 'm looking at her now ! She 's at Lukas Novak 's ! 
Lukas Novak ? But ... She 's in trouble , Dad ! 
Something weird is going on . 
That cop 's there too . Wait ... What cop ? 
The one who 's always following Rauch around . 
What 's his name again ? 
Schelle-something ? 
- Schellenberg ? 
- Schellenberg , yes , that 's it ! 
Okay , Ole , I 'm heading there now . I 'll pick you up on the way . 
Hurry ! 
Wanda . You 're alive . 
My God . 
Out with it ! 
That one goes over there . 
Careful , boys . 
The other box right next to it , okay ? 
You 're late . 
What ? 
Wanda Klatt ? 
Damn it . 
" Losing my daughter is the worst thing that has ever happened to me . 
I still wake up every morning and expect her to walk into the kitchen looking for breakfast . " 
Look , I have to be honest . 
When Katarina and Jonas first came to us with the suggestion of Wanda Fest , I thought it was a terrible idea . 
I thought it would be tacky and cheesy and the sort of thing Wanda would have been so annoyed at me for agreeing to . 
But now , now I realize that I was missing the point . 
It 's not about me . It 's about you . It 's about Sundersheim . 
We spend our whole lives so caught up in our own little worlds . 
And I ... before all this , I barely knew the people who lived on my street . 
I 've learned more about this town in the last three months than in all the years that I have lived here . 
And now look at all of you . 
You 're all here . 
Because Wanda 's fate is important to you . 
And that ... gives me hope . 
When something like this happens , you feel so alone ... but I realize , I 'm not alone . 
I 'm part of a community . 
And we might all be different ... we all have our own problems ... our own quirks and secrets . 
But we also have each other . 
And if we ... Sorry . 
And if we can all just show up for each other ... Excuse me . 
When we can show up for each other , then ... 
and now ... as a tribute to Wanda : Let 's hear it for Rüdiger . Let 's hear it . 
Operation Spring Cleaning , code red . 
Okay , a big round of applause for my sister , Carlotta ! 
That was great , Carlotta ! 
Hold the fort , I 'll get my guitar . 
Sundersheim , are you feeling good ? 
Jesus Christ . 
Wanda Klatt ? 
- Wanda Klatt , yes . 
- Damn it . 
Bring her . 
You have the address ? 
- No , where ? 
- Lander Weg . 
Lander Weg . 
You know it ? 
Lander Weg . Okay . 
We are on our way . 
Holy crap . 
Is that Wanda ? 
Schellenberg ? 
Dad ! What the hell are you doing ? 
What ? You said the police were involved ! 
I said " one " of them . 
I mean , to be fair , we don 't know that she 's not in on it . 
Where 's Wanda ? 
She was right there ! 
I heard them say they were going to take her to this place . 
Lander Weg . 
Okay , let 's go . Come on . 
Wait ! 
What about her ? 
I don 't know . We 'll figure it out . Right now , we need to save your sister . 
Come on ! 
Hurry up ! 
- Carlotta ? 
- Dedo , what 's going on ? 
She 's alive , Carlotta , she 's alive ! 
Lukas Novak has her . And Schellenberg ! 
Schellenberg ? 
We 'll pick you up on the way ! 
Dedo , are you sure that ... It 's her ! Carlotta , it 's her . 
We did it . 
She 's alive . 
I love you so much . 
Be ready outside , okay ? 
See you soon . 
Okay . Come on , come on , come on . 
Come on . 
I thought your cousin took care of her . 
Yeah , that 's what he told me , but he was hiding her this whole time in my grandma 's basement . 
I knew that idiot didn 't have a girlfriend . 
- Did you know about this ? - Why would I know about it ? 
Because it 's your damn job to know stuff like that ! 
Damn it . 
- Go ahead . Answer it . - What am I supposed to say ? 
That 's your problem . 
- You should answer . 
- Nobody asked you . 
I really don 't need this . 
Hi , boss . 
Yeah , I 'm sure . 
By tomorrow at the latest . 
There was probably a traffic jam at the border . 
Exactly , yes . 
No , no , that 's great . We 'll do that . 
Yes , we have a bit of a situation here , but we 're dealing with it . Yes . 
Wanda Klatt ? You heard . Well , yes , we 're taking care of it . 
No , no . 
She ... She 's here , yes . She 's locked up in the back of Schellenberg 's ... Where 's Wanda ? 
Damn it ! 
What the hell is happening ? 
That house ... It belongs to King ! 
- King ? - Yes . 
Did you know the cops were in on it ? No ! 
Come on ! Get in ! 
Wait ! 
What about Ole ? 
What about me ? 
I can 't be worrying about both my kids . 
- Mom , I 'm not a kid . 
- You are to me . 
I 'm sorry , honey , but I can 't risk it . 
- I need you to wait here . 
- Mom ! - Dad ? 
- Sorry , big guy , your mom is right . 
We 'll keep you posted , all right ? 
I love you . 
Come here . 
- I love you too . - Okay , it 's time . 
Let 's go . 
Be ... careful . 
Now what ? 
Maybe we should split up . 
I mean , it 's every man for himself , right ? 
Seriously ? 
You want to do this now ? Yes . Yes , I do actually . 
" I 'm sorry " ? That 's it ? 
After everything ? 
What did you expect me to do ? 
Throw an " I 'm escaping " party ? Edit together a video montage of all our best bits ? 
- You played me . 
- You kidnapped me . 
So , it was all just an act then ? 
No , no , no , of course not . 
You seduced me . Yes . 
Come on . 
What do you mean , " come on " ? 
That meant something to me . 
What exactly are you trying to say ? 
I 'm just saying . 
Sorry to interrupt this lover 's tiff . 
You guys are in so much trouble . 
Wanda Klatt . Do you have any idea the trouble you 've caused ? 
Get up , guys . 
- Please , that 's not really necess ... 
Okay . Let 's get this over with . 
Wanda , I 'm sorry . 
Oh , my God . 
What the hell is that ? 
I 'm serious ! There ! 
You don 't actually think I 'm stupid enough to fall for ... No , you have to be kidding m ... 
All available units , in pursuit of Dedo Klatt , he is traveling in a van . 
Missing person Wanda Klatt , also on the scene . 
Urgently requesting reinforcements . 
Thank you , Jonas . 
Oh , God . 
This song is for my niece , Wanda . 
Everything okay ? 
What took you so long ? 
So here we are . 
We are the Klatts . 
We used to be normal , whatever that means . 
We were just like you . We paid our taxes , drove a modestly-priced SUV , and liked coffee and cake on a Sunday . 
Then things got ... complicated . 
I just want you to know , Dedo , this is nothing personal . 
You 've always been a valued customer . 
Watch them . 
I 'll call King and tell her about this whole mess . 
She 's gonna be pissed . 
Hey , boss , it 's me again . 
- Yes . I wanted to give you an update . 
- King is a woman ? 
- We are dealing with ... - What ? Who ? 
I should have known you couldn 't get a girl to go anywhere near you , you little pussy ! 
You 're a wild one , huh ? 
Maybe I should take you down to my basement ? 
Leave her alone ! 
Hey . Don 't get jealous . 
You can come too . 
Two for the price of one . 
Easy , Pops . 
- Lukas ? 
- Yeah , what ? 
I have to head out for a minute . The boss is calling . 
Okay , go for it . 
Can you manage our little situation here ? 
Sure . 
- You got this under control ? 
- Sure , easy . 
- I 'll be right back . 
- Okay , see you later . 
Since when can he pick locks ? 
I love you . 
Get animal welfare down here to deal with this mess . 
Ms. Rauch . We found Schellenberg in the woods . He 's dead . What happened ? 
Hard to say . 
He 's a mess , looks like he was attacked by some kind of beast . 
You don 't think it could be the Nuppel ... Don 't say it . 
What about Brauer ? Did you find her ? 
Not yet , but we 're looking everywhere . 
Mr. Novak . I 'm afraid we 're going to have to take you down to the station . 
Come on . 
Let 's get you in there . 
Stop ! No ! No , no , it 's okay . 
Who was that ? 
That 's ... That 's Chris , my ... He helped me . 
Detective Rauch . I 'm really sorry about earlier . 
I didn 't know if you were also ... My phone . 
Sorry for taking it . 
Here you go . 
You 're lucky you did . I wouldn 't have found you otherwise . 
Well , thank you . 
Dedo . 
If you think that 's it after what I saw in your basement ... We have a lot to talk about , my friend . 
Wanda , it 's a pleasure to meet you . 
- I am Chief Inspector Rauch . - Yes . 
I 'm going to have to ask you to accompany me to the station . 
Don 't worry . We 're coming too . 
I 'm not letting you out of my sight anytime soon . 
That 's for me . 
Look who it is . 
- Hey , big guy ! 
- Ole , honey ! 
Mom ? What 's going on ? 
Did you find her ? 
Is everyone okay ? 
We 're fine . There 's someone here who would like to speak to you . 
Hey , pea head . 
Wanda ? 
Are you okay ? 
- Yes , of course . What did you expect ? 
- What 's going on with you guys ? 
It 's complicated . 
We 'll explain everything when we see you , all right ? 
I promise . 
But will you be all right for a little while longer ? 
Yeah , sure . 
Alex 's mum says I can stay here tonight . 
Don 't you worry . 
Ole can stay with us for as long as you need . 
He 'll be safe with us . 
- Great , thanks .
