Breakfast , kids ! 
Whoa . No rush . 
There are enough pancakes for everybody . 
- Thank you , Mom . We love you . 
- Thank you , Mom . We love you . 
I love you too . 
And what about me ? 
- You too , Daddy . - You too , Daddy . 
Honey , did you do something to your hair ? 
You look great . 
Just a little trim . 
We 're out of Honey Pops . 
I 'm sorry ? 
We 're out of Honey Pops . 
Carlotta ? 
Honey Pops . 
We are out of Honey Pops . 
Carlotta ? 
Carlotta ! 
Honey Pops ? 
And what would you like me to do about that ? 
You okay ? 
You look tired . 
Yes . All good . 
Just watching all these people , going about their lives , as if nothing has happened ... Dedo , we 've been doing this for weeks now . 
And it feels like we 're still no closer to Wanda . 
Detective Rauch keeps brushing me off . So obviously , the police aren 't any closer than we are . 
It 's only a matter of time . 
We 'll have a breakthrough soon , I can feel it . 
Ole suggested we try a drone with a thermal imaging camera . 
Should we buy one ? What do you think ? 
Worth a shot ? 
Why don 't you take the day off ? Get some fresh air , have a nice bath . 
Then we 'll start again tomorrow . 
I 'm going to keep watching for a bit . 
It makes me feel like I 'm doing something . 
All right . 
I 'm gonna go make a sandwich . 
About a hundred years ago , this Swiss guy named C.G. Jung defined synchronicity as events which seem to happen only coincidentally at the same time , but are still connected with one another and only make sense together . 
Honestly , he was probably a bit over the top . 
I mean , have you ever thought about how many things have to happen together at the same time so that , in the end , everything happens exactly as it happens ? 
And what if only one tiny detail were different ? 
Your life would take a completely different course . 
Just like when my mother thought it would be a good idea if our neighbor Karin cut my hair , and she then gave me totally ridiculous bangs which made my whole third grade hell . 
Hey , fate can sometimes really be an asshole . DAY 96 Wanda leaves the house . 
Her cell phone is found at the coffee shop . 
This is where her T-shirt is thrown into the recycling bin , and this is where she appears in Lenka 's Instagram post . 
The mobile data of Lenka 's cell phone indicates that she stopped here , here , here , here , and here before apparently driving all the way back to the Czech Republic without stopping , where she drives off the side of a mountain . 
Maybe she nodded off ? From all that driving . 
It looks a bit like a mouse , right ? 
Nose , there are the ears , then the tail . 
So , the picture by the statue is Lenka 's last post . 
And the post before that was here . 
Hello . 
So , did you find the culprit ? 
The thing that was eating your birds . 
Right , the birds . 
Yes . 
We think it 's a badger . 
A badger ! 
Such majestic animals . 
But it 's unusual that they attack birds . 
Yeah ? 
This one 's a real asshole . 
Right . 
Anyway , we thought we 'd search the forest for its nest . 
And my son was telling me about these thermal imaging drones ? 
I have just the thing . 
A badger ? 
Seriously ? 
Lucie , you 're lurking ? 
You know I don 't like it when you lurk . 
- Everything okay ? - Yes . Yes . 
Yes ? 
Sorry , sweetie . Give me a minute . 
What ? 
Well , that 's less than ideal ... Hey . It 's me . 
Just tried to talk to my mum again , but she 's too busy . 
Freaking out a bit , but it 's probably fine , right ? 
I mean , Lina didn 't get her period for two weeks , and that was just because Mercury was in retrograde . 
Please call back . 
Oh , man . 
- All right . There you go . 
- Thank you . 
Did you ever break a man 's heart ? 
Harald ! What did we say about scaring off customers ? 
- Sorry . - Yep . 
His wife 's just been put in a home with dementia . 
Oh , I 'm sorry . 
And then his girlfriend left him . 
- Everything all right , Harald ? - Yeah , yeah . 
What can I get you ? 
I 'm investigating the disappearance of a young woman . 
Wanda Klatt . 
Yes , I know the family . 
It 's really terrible . 
Anita ! 
Harald ! 
I 'm actually talking about another woman . Okay . 
No , I don 't know her . 
- Who is she ? 
- An influencer from the Czech Republic . 
Influencers are not exactly our typical clientele . 
She was here last Nuppelwocken Night . 
Well , lots of people come here on Nuppelwocken Night . 
It 's probably our busiest day of the year , what with the parade and the football ... 
- Why are you looking for her ? 
- She 's dead . - Dead ? 
- She had a car accident . 
Supposedly . 
- On the Czech border . - Yeah . 
- Less than 24 hours after she was here . - Oh , God . 
Oh , well . 
No . 
No . I don 't remember her . Sorry . 
All right . 
- In case you think of something . - I 'll call . 
- Goodbye . - Bye . 
- Harald , seriously , again ? 
- Anita . Yes , Anita . 
- Hey . 
- What are you doing ? 
What ? 
Today 's delivery day . 
You said the last installment was due today . 
Not here . 
Come on . 
Hi . What can I get you ? 
I 'll take a pineapple juice with a shot of tequila . 
But the pineapple juice has to be fresh . 
Fine , just give me one of those . 
Great costume . 
What are you ? Some kind of scarecrow ? 
I 'm the Nuppelwocken . 
Today is Nuppelwocken Night . 
WuppelNocken ? 
Nuppelwocken ! 
Puppen-Dockel ? 
- Nuppelwocken . 
- I have no idea what you are saying . 
It 's an old legend . 
See ? 
That 's the Nuppelwocken . It 's a monster that lives in the forest , and every hundred years it comes into town to snatch the most beautiful maiden . 
Love that . 
I better watch my back then . 
You do that . 
- Can I help you with anything else ? 
Do you know what a pangolin is ? 
- What ? 
- They 're adorable . 
But more than a million pangolins were poached in the last year alone . 
Stop filming , please . 
I 'm trying to locate the mastermind of the biggest wildlife smuggling ring in Europe . 
I asked you nicely to stop filming . 
He calls himself the King . 
- She said stop filming . - Hey . 
Touch my stuff again , Voldemort , and I 'll pepper spray you in the face . 
Look . I 've never heard of any king . Okay ? So drink up and get out . 
- You haven 't ? 
- Nope . 
That 's strange . 
Because he does a lot of transactions from here . 
Black Souk . 
Ever heard of it ? 
It 's a marketplace on the dark net . 
Now , the mistake most people make is thinking the dark web is one hundred percent anonymous . 
But that makes them vulnerable . 
Wait here . 
What ? 
Don 't look at me like that . 
I have 125,000 followers . 
Don 't make me set the Trolls on you . 
King wants to speak with you . 
Write down your info . 
X , TikTok or Insta ? 
Your phone number . 
Okay , boomer . 
This is disgusting by the way . 
Yes , it 's me . I need you here . Now . 
No , thank you . 
This is the only bus that goes from this stop . 
I 'll take the next one . Thanks . 
The next one is in an hour . 
I 'm good , thank you . 
- Wanna try ? 
- I don 't think that 's a good idea . 
Let 's see what that thing can do . 
And how are you doing ? 
You okay ? 
Things have been kind of crazy lately . 
Losing Wanda like that , no warning . No explanation . That does something to you . 
It makes you realize how tiny we are in this giant , chaotic universe . 
Like little mice , running around on the train tracks . 
Unaware they could be smooshed at any moment . 
Then once you see the world like that , you can 't get rid of it . 
How does it end ? 
What do you mean ? 
What if we don 't find her ? 
We 'll find her . 
We have to . 
Okay , let me see . 
Where are we ? 
That looks familiar . 
That 's that new kebab place that just opened . 
Maybe we swing by after and grab lunch ? 
A kid from my class went . 
Was it good ? 
He shat himself at the cinema afterwards . 
Burgers it is then ? 
So from here , you go north to the intersection . 
Follow the main road to the roundabout . 
Past all the apartment buildings . 
Go on , go on , go on . 
And stop at the corner . Stop . 
Yes , exactly . 
That 's our starting point . 
Ground zero . 
The clothes bin where they found Wanda 's T-shirt . 
Buddy , now take her as high as she 'll go . 
DONATION BIN So , we 've done all these . 
Those too . All that 's left are these and the houses by the edge of the woods . 
Oh , man . Wanda , honey , we know you 're out there somewhere . 
Give us a sign . 
Wanda ! 
- Wanda ! 
- Wanda ! 
- Where are you ? 
- Wanda ! 
- Hi , Lucie . 
- Hi . 
She is in one of my classes . 
They 're all pretty much the same . 
I would take this one . 
It comes in a double pack . And it 's super easy . 
I 'm buying it for a friend . 
Then tell your friend that she doesn 't have to be embarrassed . 
Nearly every woman has probably gone through this at some point . 
We just don 't talk about it . 
I never talked to my daughter about it either . 
I guess I thought that if I didn 't talk about it , then ... it wasn 't happening . 
Pretty stupid , right ? 
Whenever I try to talk to my mom about it , she is busy . 
Lucie , believe me , she will always have time for this kind of conversation . 
How do you know my name ? 
You go to the same school as my kids . 
I ... I am Ole 's and Wanda 's mom . 
I knew you looked familiar . Yeah . 
I 'm sorry about the thing with Wanda . 
She was cool . I hope she comes back . 
I didn 't want to ... Do you need to sit down ? 
We could get a coffee or something . 
Sure . Let 's have some coffee . 
Wow , it 's good , isn 't it ? 
Do you know who we can recommend Spicy Snacks to ? 
Uncle Rüdiger . 
I think he 'd be really happy about it . 
It was fun hanging out today . 
We should do it more often . 
It 's not easy . 
You and Mom are always busy with this Wanda stuff . 
But we always have time for you too . 
You know that , right ? 
Are you and Mom getting a divorce ? 
What ? 
No . 
What makes you think that ? 
Did Mom say something ? No , no . 
She 's just angry all the time , and then you keep doing stuff which upsets her 
Buddy , I am really trying . 
I know . 
What 's this ? 
Oh , shit . 
He 's found the bug . 
That 's not good . 
Police ? 
Somebody broke into my house . 
That 's not good at all . 
- Should we call Mom ? - Absolutely not . 
We got this . Come on . 
We just have to get the cameras out of there . 
That 's really nice of you . 
I 'm already better . 
Not sure what that was . 
It 's okay . 
I get it . 
It 's gotta be tough . 
Wanda 's the grade above me but I remember her . 
She was always so glamorous and sassy . 
That 's her . 
I met someone the morning she disappeared . 
In the woods . 
You 're late . 
I took a detour so no one would see me . The whole town is out and about today . 
No one saw you , right ? 
Relax . 
You 're so paranoid . 
Listen , I could lose my job . 
You 're 15 . 
I could go to jail . 
No one saw me . 
I swear . 
And I saw Wanda . 
Did you tell the police ? 
Why not , for heaven 's sake ? 
This is important . 
I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . 
I know I should have said something . 
I wanted to say something , but I ... He made me promise not to . Who made you promise ? 
He 's a teacher . 
Okay . I get it . 
And I 'm assuming that 's also what this is about ? 
Oh , Lucie . 
- Lucie , Lucie , Lucie , Lucie ... 
- Please don 't tell my mom . 
All right . 
I 'm not going to tell your mom . 
Mr. Hessel , it 's the police . 
What do you want from me ? 
Help ! 
Why is he fighting back like that ? 
That 's not good . That 's not good at all . 
- Get the cameras . 
- Let go , asshole ! 
You guys are such pussies . 
You are messing with the wrong guy . I was in the military . 
Why did you hit him so hard ? 
That was self-defense . 
- Is he dead ? 
It doesn 't look like he 's breathing . 
Oh , no . 
Why does he have to yell at me like that ? 
- Oh , my God . 
What did we do ? 
- And now ? 
... I 've been following Wanda 's investigation on social media . 
There 's a ton of people posting about it . 
Really ? 
Have you heard about the Dark House ? 
The Dark House ? 
It 's a house on Forststraße . 
The last one on the left . 
No one ever goes in and no one ever comes out . 
It 's this awful gray color , like rotting meat . 
And there 's all these signs saying , " No trespassing " and , " Beware of the dog . " 
But no one 's ever heard a dog barking . 
Some say that the people living there roam the forest at night . 
Only coming out in darkness , under the full moon . 
In search of their next victim to devour . 
- Wait . 
- Well , that 's just one of the theories . 
Other people think Wanda ran away to join Cirque du Soleil . 
You know , if you want to , you could pop in there and do these now ? 
I 'm sure everything will be okay . 
But if not , we can figure out what you want to do together . 
DAY 0 
King . Wow , you 're not what I expected . 
Look , I know you 're a busy smuggler so I 'll get to the point . 
Either I tell the police what I know , or you grant me an exclusive anonymous interview . 
I 've already made a video , it 's locked and loaded in my drafts , ready to post . 
The question is , do you want me to control the narrative ? 
What ? 
Seriously ? 
Okay , drop me a pin and I 'll be there . 
Come here . 
Lucie , listen . 
You and this man , I 'm not sure it 's a great idea . 
There are some really cool guys your own age . 
Like my son , Ole . 
I don 't think I 'm Ole 's type . 
Not on my watch , pal . 
Oh , man . 
We 're dealing with a dead influencer and a missing girl . 
Surely someone else could have taken this call ? 
We have more important fish ... to fry . 
Mr. Hessel . 
You called ? 
It 's Rauch , from the Police Department . 
Please open the door . 
- Quiet . 
What do we do ? - Mr. Hessel ? Are you there ? 
I don 't know ... 
Try the back door . 
Good idea . 
Mr. Hessel ? 
Where 's the van ? 
It was right here . 
Okay , Mr. Hessel . We 're coming in . 
What do we do ? 
We have to get away . 
Slowly , very slowly . 
Come on . Come on ! 
Shit . 
Thanks for ... You know . 
You 're very welcome . 
Just one thing . 
The morning you saw Wanda , which way was she headed ? 
She drove in this direction . 
But she was alone . 
Okay , good to know . 
Thank you . 
Lucie ? 
- What are you doing here ? 
- Hello . 
We 've met . 
I 'm Carlotta Klatt . 
Ole 's mom ? 
- And Wanda 's . 
- My God , of course . 
I 've seen you at school events . 
You 're the queen of potato salad . 
Yes , Lucie ... Well , she saw me and she was expressing her sympathy . 
I didn 't know my daughter was so empathetic . 
She tends to hide it from me . 
I just wanted to get some ice cream . 
Maybe we can watch a movie together later ? 
Sounds lovely . 
Why don 't you go in and pick something ? 
I 'll be right in and then we can ride home together . 
I just wanted to say that I can 't even begin to imagine what you are going through . 
If you ever want to get a coffee or need someone to talk to , I 'm just down the street . 
- I would love that . 
Thank you so much . - Yes ? Great . 
Put in your number and I 'll drop you a text . 
God . 
- Some people drive like complete idiots . - Yes . 
Are they following us ? 
I don 't think so . 
Should I answer ? 
You know that Mom can never find out about this , right ? 
What exactly ? 
Breaking into Mr. Hessel 's house and punching him in the face ? 
Or stealing a van and running from the cops ? 
Oh , my God . 
You think I 'm crazy ? Of course I 'm not going to tell her . 
She 'd kill me . 
- Yeah , she would kill you . 
- She would really kill me . 
Then drive you to the hospital , have you resuscitated - just so she could kill you again . 
- Yes . 
And then she 'd put you in some boarding school in Switzerland where everyone speaks Latin and dresses like Harry Potter . 
Could you turn left here please ? 
You can stop here . 
Okay . Great , thanks . 
We 'll ditch the van in the woods , okay ? 
What 's that ? 
Rüdiger ? 
What ? 
Dad ! Dad ! 
3 MISSED CALLS FROM CARLOTTA A secret surveillance camera ? 
Yes , exactly . 
Hidden in the lamp in the hallway . 
- And then there were two men . - Bye . A short , round one and a scrawny fellow . 
With fast food bags over their heads ? Right . 
They broke in and attacked me . Knocked me out cold . 
When I came to , both the camera and the men had disappeared . 
Miraculously vanished , right ? 
It all makes sense now . 
That 's how they knew about Margaret . 
It 's their fault that Anita left me . 
Mr. Hessel , do you remember that we already ran into each other today ? 
At the Kapitän ? 
Were you there for much longer ? 
Did you keep drinking ? 
Just a small libation to ease my grief . 
Anita is gone . 
She 's gone . 
- She is gone . - Rauch here . 
Gone . 
Anita is gone . 
Ms. Rauch , Carlotta Klatt here . 
I just wanted to tell you that someone saw Wanda . On the day she disappeared , heading into the forest . 
What ? How do you know ? 
I spoke with a witness . 
What kind of witness ? 
- I 'm sorry , I can 't tell you . - Excuse me ? 
It doesn 't matter . 
This is new information that you didn 't have before . 
Mrs. Klatt , if the information is credible , then this witness needs to come in and make a statement . 
Have you already looked at the Dark House ? 
- The what ? - That big , creepy house near Forstplatz ? 
There are many , many theories circulating about it online . 
Now I admit , some of them sound a bit far-fetched ... Okay , I 'm gonna stop you there . Because I have actual police work to do . 
But I advise you not to go looking for Wanda on the internet 
You won 't find anything good there . 
Goodbye . 
- Silly cow . 
- Silly cow . 
Ole ! Ole , please ! 
Ole ! 
Wake up ! 
Are you all right ? 
Ole . Hey . Ole ! 
Are you okay ? 
Are you all right ? 
- Yes , I 'm okay . 
- Thank God . 
I 'm sorry , I don 't know what happened . 
- Are you okay ? 
- It 's all right , Dad . 
- I 'm fine . 
- Oh , my God . 
We have to get out of here . Okay ? 
Oh , shit . 
Oh , shit . 
Oh , God . 
Oh , God . 
Dad ? 
Why is there a cage ? 
I have no idea , and I don 't want to know . 
Give me that thing . 
Let 's get out of here . 
Ole , come on ! 
- Are you okay ? 
- Yeah , okay . 
Does anything hurt ? 
No . 
Shit . 
Did you get lost ? 
- You 're the journalist , right ? 
- Investigative influencer . 
Same as a journalist but with more Likes . 
You want to talk to the King , right ? Yes . 
Then come with me . 
Come on . 
I don 't bite . 
No !
