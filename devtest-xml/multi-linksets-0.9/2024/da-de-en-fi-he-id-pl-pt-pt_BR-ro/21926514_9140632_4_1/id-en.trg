I can 't remember if it 's fork on the left or spoon on the left . 
If I don 't figure this out now , what will I do if I get crowned princess of a small European country ? 
If you behead a few people right off the bat , they won 't care how you place your flatware . 
Luckily , our table-setting expert is right here . 
Care to weigh in , Lone Moose 's Cup King , Ham Tobin ? 
So ... not like I had it ? 
Sorry , Wolf . I 'm in the middle of a major crisis here . 
I am freaking out about the stupid assignment for my public speaking elective . 
It 's worth 50 % of our grade and it 's known as ... The soul crusher . 
You belong to me now , Ham . 
As you can probably guess by how demonic Moon is acting , the assignment is to give a speech to his class . 
No , not room 15 . 
They 're notorious hecklers . 
I heard Jeremy Nicholbottom transferred schools after presenting to that class last semester . 
Who did you hear that from ? 
Who didn 't I hear it from ? 
The heckles get so bad most people don 't even finish the speech . 
Mr. Golovkin teaches my class and he loves failing people for not finishing . 
He called it " one of life 's delights . " 
And the topic of the speech isn 't helping , either . It 's " Alaska : Wow . " 
That sounds easy . Alaska is full of wows . 
Which of its many wonders are you focusing on ? 
Let me read you what I have so far . 
" Alaska has the longest coastline in the nation with 66,000 miles of shorelines . Wow . " 
Oh , Ham , my class is gonna eat you alive . 
And I 'll personally pick the last bit of gristle off your bones . 
Moon , that 's your brother . 
Family means nothing in room 15 . 
What if this brings my grade down to a B-minus ? 
That 's a Ham Tobin F. I 'll have to run away to Seattle , and I 'm no Frasier . 
I 'm not even a Niles . 
Ham , buddy , calm down . 
You just need a more " Alaska : Wow " topic . If I were giving the speech ... which I am not because I chose turquoise jewelry design as my elective ... 
I , too , could spin any number of colorful Alaskan yarns . 
I 've also got an Alaskan story in my butt that 'll make you say " what ? " 
Fools . 
I bet none of your stories would impress me . 
How about we make it a contest ? 
We each tell our own " Alaska : Wow " story and Moon chooses the best one . 
And then I can use that one for my presentation . 
It 's not plagiarism when you 're saving your own life . I 'm in . 
And like velour sweatpants and infinity scarves , you 're both already out . 
And if you snooze , you lose . 
Sorry , just some good-natured ribbing , nothing personal meant by it . 
Whereas everything I say during your stories will be personal . 
Who 's first ? 
The loud teen , the plaid mumbler or the lady dressed as Barney 's sister ? 
The heckling has begun . 
I stay ready so I don 't have to get ready . 
I 'll go first . 
Now presenting : the true story of how Bob Ross , one of America 's most beloved painters found inspiration in Alaska . 
Perfect topic , Judy . 
Ten-year-olds go crazy for beloved painters . Well , no . 
Well , no , it was-it was more exciting than just that because , uh , uh , true fact : 
Bob Ross was stationed here in the Air Force . 
You like airplanes , right ? 
And he was part of a , um , Air Force fighter pilot training thingy . 
And it 's really exciting . And cinematic , actually , some might say . 
We see Bob-Judy Maverick Ross , flying in a very cool fighter jet . 
Wow , Ham Hock , look at these gorgeous clouds . 
I mean , I know we 're in the middle of life-or-death flight training , but I-I ... I simply must paint them . 
Uh , Bob-Judy Maverick Ross , I think you should fly the plane . 
Sorry , but you know they call me Maverick because of my unorthodox flying style . 
Bob-Judy Maverick Ross , please stop painting . We 're headed right for a mountain ! - Whoops . 
Eh , Ham Hock might be okay . 
Ham Hock 's dead . 
That 's the eighth navigator you 've killed this week with your painting . 
What can I say ? I 'm a Maverick . Damn it , I ought to ground you , but because everyone else is dead and you have a cool leather jacket , I 'm sending you to the most elite flight academy in the country : Snow Gun . 
Bob-Judy was sent to Snow Gun in Alaska , and Chief Beeferson was also going , for plot reasons . 
So , Bob-Judy sets off for the North . 
As he 's landing , he knows he 's gonna love Snow Gun Alaska because ... Because they had hunk volleyball ! 
Just a bunch of shirtless dudes having fun , patting butts , screaming , " Yeah ! " in slow-motion . 
What are the rules ? Nobody knows and nobody cares . 
- Wolf . 
- What ? 
We were all waiting for that scene . 
Stop messing up my story . 
Yeah , she wants to mess it up herself . 
Judy , please . I need this to be good . 
And it will be , because the best thing about Snow Gun was the gorgeous Alaskan scenery . 
Bob-Judy knew right away that he would need to paint all of it while flying and killing more pilots . 
I need to paint all of this while flying and killing more pilots . 
And then Maverick meets his new nemeses , IceWolf and HoneyBarf . 
We know all about your reputation , Maverick . 
You 're too dangerous to be in a plane . 
Your dad was reckless , too . 
Hundreds of men died on D-Day because your dad was sculpting in his plane over Normandy . 
And in the War of 1812 , your great-grandpa would fall off his horse because of his damn decoupage . 
Wow , you guys know a lot about my family . 
We know your painting is writing checks your plane can 't cash . 
And even though we hate each other right now we 're gonna later come to share a mutual respect . 
Looking forward to it . 
Maverick ! I finally found someone willing to fly with you . 
- Call sign : Goose . 
- Honk . Bob-Judy , no more painting up there . 
I can 't bury another man , even if that man is a goose . 
Damn this majestic Alaskan scenery . 
Maybe I 'll just paint one little happy tree ... 
Eject , Goose , eject ! 
Bob-Judy ejects just in time , but Goose couldn 't work the ejection lever because uh , because he was a goose . 
Honk , honk , honk , honk ! - No ! 
- But , luckily , Goose remembered he could fly . - Honk . 
But then he got sucked into the engine . 
My painting . 
Oh , and Goose ! 
Moon , I hope you 're liking this story because things are about to get " soary . " 
The only thing you should be " soary " about is talking , babe . 
Did you just call your sister " babe " ? 
It 's an energy , Dad . Please don 't question it . 
Come on , Judy , I need something good . 
I 'm gonna be pulled limb from limb by a bunch of toddlers tomorrow . 
And then we 'll sword fight with your arms while your partially-living head still screams . 
Fun . So , 
Bob-Judy is despondent after losing-slash-killing his best and only friend , Goose . 
Goose 's wife and child were also sad . - Honk . - Honk . But this isn 't about them . It 's about our cool hero , who expressed his sadness by riding a motorcycle . 
But then something exciting happened . 
Damn it . We 've got bogeys . 
Scramble the jets ! 
What the hell ? 
Damn it , Mav . We have to send these planes up now . 
Oh , really ? Can we at least let them dry first ? 
So , IceWolf and HoneyBarf are fighting the enemy and saying cool fighter stuff , like ... 
- Lock and load . 
- Roger that . 
Aircraft carrier . 
The MiG on our six is not engaging . 
It 's like ... it 's like he can 't see us . 
And that 's when they realized Bob-Judy 's painting had made the planes ... 
Invisible . 
Damn it , Mav , you did it . 
But then Chief Beeferson notices ... The sun is setting . 
All the sky colors are changing in a breathtaking way . 
But Beeferson had an idea . 
IceWolf , HoneyBarf , I need you to fly full speed towards that building . 
Sounds great , you got it . 
Pull up , pull up ! 
And because of how much Alaska made Bob-Judy say , " Wow ! , " the good guys from America won against the vague but definitely evil bad guys . 
Well , Maverick , - I guess I respect you now . 
- To Maverick . 
Then Bob-Judy pops the champagne bottle and hits the mom goose , 
- Geez , Judy . - What ? You wanted excitement . 
Okay . 
Moon , did you love it ? 
I love when it ended . Not to worry , Ham . 
I 've got a speech about something that makes everyone say " wow " : flags . 
Your groans of excitement are warranted . 
I 'm gonna tell you the true story of how Alaska 's actual state flag came to be designed by a 14-year-old named Benny Benson . 
A real Alaskan hero close in age to yourself , and I will tell it based on a truly action-packed movie I recently saw that was originally about math and janitors . 
- Young Benny Quinnson ... - Oh , my God . Did you change the boy who designed the Alaskan flag into Moon 's crush Quinn in a sad attempt to win ? 
I definitely don 't have a crush on Quinn . 
That 's defamation , but I 'm listening . 
Benny Quinnson worked as a janitor at Alaska Flag University , the foremost institution for flag design . 
Well , if it isn 't Mary Moppins . 
Mop that , loser . 
You 're just a 14-year-old punk who doesn 't know anything about flag design and , uh , - you never will . 
- But Benny Quinnson had a secret none of the flag design students knew : 
she was a flag design genius , with the ability to see the beautiful complexity of flags that others couldn 't . 
But she kept it to herself because all of her friends were nice but also super dumb . 
And all they did was play hunk volleyball ! 
Just a bunch of shirtless townies breaking into the university at night , and the air conditioning is off , so they 're greasy as hell . 
What are the rules out here ? Nobody knows and nobody cares . 
- Wolf . 
- Okay , fine . 
Actually , all Benny and her friends did was hang out at the local bar in their Alaskan town . 
Hello , my dirtbag friend , HoneyBen . 
I 'm also a dirtbag who turns out to be a genius but never forgets her dirtbag roots . 
As your best friend who 's the same age as you , you want a drink ? 
Of course , because I have a sad flag-related thing in my past I 'm trying to repress . 
I can 't believe that you 're so much better at creating flags than everyone at the school , but you 're just a janitor there . 
That 's all I 've ever known . 
My dad was a janitor and his dad was a janitor and his dad was a mop . 
You know , every morning when I come to your house , I hope you 're not there . 
That 's a mean thing to say . 
No . It 's-it 's heartfelt . Because you 're too smart . 
You know , they 're looking for someone to make a new flag for our great state of Alaska . 
If it ain 't about sweeping or trash , I don 't want to hear it . 
I 've put flags behind me because of that sad flag-related thing in my past . 
Wow , you really know how to make a floor wet . 
Thank you . 
But you know what you know even more ? Flags . 
I know you solved the unsolvable equation that I left on the board . 
You could be the next Flannery McBanner , and they named banners after her . 
Flags aren 't just pieces of fabric flapping in the wind like idiots , they give us our identity , and you could create the one our state needs . 
- I can 't . 
- Is it because you have a sad flag-related thing in your past ? 
Yes , that 's exactly what it is . 
Then I need to send you to a " tell it like it is " therapist who will never give up on you . 
I 'm Dr. Notyafault , and I 'm gonna help you with the sad flag-related thing in your past . I 'm also gonna tell it like it is . 
Let me guess ... a flag killed your beloved pony , Peppermint ? 
Yes . That is what happened . 
All I wanted was to show my beloved pony , Peppermint , the largest flag in the world . 
He also loved flags , because who doesn 't ? 
But when I stood back to take a photo of my pony near the flag , the flag was too heavy . It flattened him to death . 
The only thing left to bury was his tail . 
After that , I swore I 'd never have anything to do with flags again , which is why I bought a zoo and tried to deal with my amnesia while being chased by international assassins hell-bent on killing me . 
Here 's the deed to your zoo . - 
- Beef , no ! Those are totally different Matt Damon movies . 
- Are they ? 
- Yep . 
Right . So then ... Benny Quinnson , I know you 're sad that a flag flattened Peppermint , but I must tell it like it is . 
You 're a flag genius . 
You can 't keep running from this . 
Yes , I can . 
I 'll never give up on you , but I will bill you for this session even though you have 44 minutes left . 
And so Benny ran . Ran even though she knew she should stop running . 
Just like you should stop running your damn mouth . - Moon . 
- If you can 't stand the heat , stay out of the crematorium , babe . 
Come on , Dad , I need a miracle . 
Hang in there , Ham . 
So , Dr. Notyafault doesn 't give up on Benny because he refuses to . 
Hi , Dr. Notyafault . 
Thinking about flags , kid ? 
Always . 
Benny , what happened to Peppermint ... it 's not ya fault . 
Yes , it is . 
- Isn 't . 
- Is . 
- No , it 's not . 
- Hm , yeah . I never looked at it that way before . 
It 's not my fault . 
You 're cured . 
Now , can I tell you the story of how my wife died ? 
- No , thank you . - Well , I listened to your thing , but fine . 
You know , a flag can say so much with so little . 
That flag of our great state of Alaska will stay blank , saying nothing at all , unless somebody figures out how to fill it in . 
Now that my best friend left without even saying goodbye , it actually feels pretty bad . 
So even though Benny was only 14 , she created a flag that was just like Alaska ... beautiful in its simplicity . 
That son of a bitch . 
This flag was her fault . And I love it . 
The majesty ... of flags . 
Father , the only interest I have in flags is you moving ours to half-mast ' cause your funeral is right around the corner , old man . 
You see how I 'm talking to Dad , Ham ? To our own father , whom I actually respect ? 
Now imagine there 's 20 of me , desperate to get to their pudding pack at lunch . 
Oh , God , I 'm doomed . 
Maybe I should see if Jeff Bezos wants to take me to space like that little Dutch boy . 
Ham , keep it together , ' cause I 'm about to destroy your father and sister . 
- Leave the threats to me . 
- So sorry . 
Now , before I start up my story car and drive it directly into your brain , let me ask you one thing , 
Moon , do you hate vegetables ? 
I do , in fact , hate vegetables . 
Then imagine a world , right here in Alaska , where the only food was plain vegetables . 
Then , imagine that one man , an ordinary plumber by the name of Steve Henson , was about to do something extraordinary . To make an invention that would echo through time , bringing joy to millions . 
Yes , that man invented ranch dressing , and I 'm gonna tell you how he did it in a way that 's fun and actiony and doesn 't totally make sense , like The Matrix , but also totally original . 
Just go with it . 
So , we 're in , like , this dystopian future , and in this dystopian future we find an ordinary plumber living in Alaska by the name of Honey-bee-o Henson . 
Tell me , Honey , will this story " bee " over anytime soon ? 
I just started . 
And it 's " bee-o , " like Neo . 
Again , not that this is based on The Matrix or anything . 
Honeybee , you are now my only hope . I am begging you to take this seriously . 
And I 'm begging you to stop now while you 're way , way behind . 
Both of you shut your holes and let me roll . 
Like I said , there were only vegetables in this world , so that 's all anyone ate , day in and day out . 
Until one spooky morning , when Honey-bee-o goes to the fridge and ... 
Wake up , Honey-bee-o . 
But I am awake . 
Never mind , I 'm coming out . 
Then the fridge door opened , and a cool , mysterious bad boy stepped out , 
Guy Morfieri . 
Hello , Honey-bee-o . 
The world you 're living in is a lie . 
Also , you 're low on radishes . 
Okay , how did you get in there ? And in here ? 
There 's no time to explain , and it also wouldn 't make any sense , but listen , this world ... the world around you ... it 's actually imaginary . 
Everything ? 
Even my toilet ? 
Especially your toilet , but there is a real world . 
With real toilets ? Stop talking about toilets . 
I need you to focus . 
The real world is just people in goo pods . 
It 's pretty gross , but at least it 's real , or whatever . 
And are there toilets in there ? 
- I swear to God . 
- Sorry . 
Look , we have to wake everyone up from goo sleep to set them free , so I 've chosen you to help . 
Make sense ? 
- Nope . 
- Perfect . 
Oh , and here 's the big thing : 
vegetables don 't have to taste bad . 
We 've all been lied to , and that 's why you have to choose . 
Eat this Brussel sprout , and you stay in the world you know , or take this clove of garlic and change everything forever and be in a bunch of danger . 
Brussel sprout , please . - No , pick the other one . 
- Uh , normally , I don 't eat straight-up garlic from men who step out of my refrigerator , but you 're charming as hell and your hair makes me smile , so let 's go . 
So , what do you think so far , Moon ? 
I liked the part where you said vegetables suck , but I hated the part where you kept talking . 
Oh , no ! 
Talking is , like , the main part of a presentation . 
Sounds like I 'm still in the running . 
And I think my flag story was pretty nice . 
And I think it was a war crime . Tomato , " tomahto . " 
Speaking of tomatoes , when Honey-bee-o takes the garlic , she and Guy Morfieri go into this , like , uh , white void space so she can train to save the world from flavorless vegetables , starting with ... Hunk volleyball ! 
It 's dudes in leather shorts spinning a cauliflower ball on one finger . 
- Wolf ! 
- Sorry , my Matrix Maven . - Go on . - So , 
Honey-bee-o and Guy Morfieri do , like , karate stuff and some light gymnastics , and it 's very unclear how those things would help people get out of goo pods , but it looks cool as hell . 
Damn it . No matter how cool this looks , it isn 't working . 
- What should we do ? 
- Hmm . I know . 
Let 's go see a weird lady who speaks in riddles and will also not explain anything . 
Perfect . 
As The Jude-acle , I can tell you , you might be The One , Honey-bee-o , but first you have to believe that you 're The One . 
So , am I The One ? Or ... I 'm pretty sure it 's you , but I 'm wrong a lot . 
I thought the guy in The Jinx documentary was innocent , so , you know what I mean ? 
And then , um ... something happens . 
You don 't remember the movie , do you ? 
- What movie ? 
- The Matrix . 
This isn 't that . 
It 's just a cool story I 'm making up . Oh , oh , oh , hold on , I remember now . 
I just remembered I 'm supposed to upload some instructions to your brain . 
I 'm just gonna pop back to goo world real quick . 
Cool spoon trick . 
Okay , um , sorry about that . I just uploaded something to your goo world brain . 
A recipe for some kind of sauce . 
Oh , and I also uploaded a playlist called " Now That 's What Guy Calls Music " that takes me to an emotional Flavortown when I 'm feeling down . 
A lot of Spin Doctors on there . 
Well , then why don 't we go ahead now and get back to the goo world , make this sauce recipe you uploaded in my brain and then put it in the goo pods so I can win this story competition . 
Wait , what story competition ? 
No time to explain . Let 's go . And then Agent Beef Smith shows up to stop them because he wants people to stay in those goo pods forever . 
Vegetables should not be delicious . 
If you don 't like dry broccoli , just try it wet . 
- Like , soaked in water ? - Yes . 
What are you talking about , man ? 
Nobody wants wet-getables . 
Honey-bee-o , kick this guy 's ass . 
And then they fought . 
Honey-bee-o used his , uh , mind powers to make ingredients appear and made them fly around and mixed it all in the air in a big ol ' blob of floating sauce , but then Agent Beef Smith shoots at him with carrot bullets . 
But he stops them mid-air with flavor powers . 
Alaska : Wow ! 
With the perfect combination of buttermilk , mayo , eggs and a proprietary blend of herbs and spices , I 've invented an amazing sauce right here in this fine state . 
I 'll call it Donkey Sauce . 
I will sue you into oblivion . 
Ranch dressing it is . 
And then she sends the carrot with the ranch dressing into his mouth and the flavor was too delicious . 
No ! It 's too delicious ! 
- Honey-bee-o , you did it . 
- Yes , and I think it all made perfect sense , don 't you ? 
Definitely . 
Let 's go sauce those pods . 
So then everyone got free of their goo pods , and then , in the sequel , they have a big rave in a cave . 
And that 's the true story of how Alaska was the site of the invention of the most perfect sauce of all time . 
And the real inventor 's name was Steven Henson , and I worship him and his beautiful mind . 
Case closed . I win . 
Did she win , Moon ? Or did Judy win ? 
Or Dad ? 
Which story will make it so I don 't wind up peeing my pants in front of your class ? 
I 'm sorry , Ham , but I can 't choose . 
I 'm forced to declare a three-way tie for worst story ever . 
But my story was about hating vegetables . 
It was about salad , which I wouldn 't even eat if it was dipped in frosting . 
Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . 
What am I supposed to do ? 
I 'm sorry , Ham , but it 's time to get your affairs in order because tomorrow , you die . 
All right , everyone , I have just realized that the lasagna has been in for 90 extra minutes and is on fire , so , let 's extinguish it and go out for pizza . 
Desperate to get to their pudding pack . - Pack . Pack . 
- " Now That 's What Guy Calls Music . " - Music . 
Music . Music . - Wouldn 't even eat if it was dipped in frosting . 
I know what I have to do . 
Um , so , uh , today , I will be telling you about Alaska 's coastlines ... 
- So long , brother . 
As shown on these cupcakes I made ! 
Everyone gets six . 
Six whole cupcakes that you will get to eat during my speech . 
Now we 're talking . 
You son of a bitch . 
You cracked it . 
Are you really giving each of my students six cupcakes ? Yep . 
And in ten minutes it 'll be your problem . 
But for now , their mouths are too full to say a word , so ... 
Alaska : Wow ! 
Our great state has the longest coastline in the nation .
