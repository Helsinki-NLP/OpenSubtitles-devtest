[ Ham ] Get him , everybody ! 
Get him ! [ Jerrybee ] Moon , get back here ! 
Don 't think I won 't bite a child ! 
[ Moon ] Aunt Dirt , shoot anyone who follows me ! 
- [ gunshot ] - [ hammer clicks ] 
- Damn it , I 'm out of bullets . 
[ overlapping chatter ] 
[ Golovkin ] Snerts ! 
- [ groaning ] - Yes , I won ! 
In your face and your face and your face . 
It 's very strange to get yelled at by my teacher like this in my own home . 
I am not here as your teacher , I am here as your father 's friend . 
- [ doorbell rings ] - [ gasps ] They 've arrived . 
Give me now . 
What the hell is a Coddingham Creme Potato ? Oh , Jerry , it is the Cadillac of potato-shaped holiday novelty chocolates . 
Minty , chocolatey , and with little bits of fried potato inside . 
Intriguing . We were gifted a box of them on St. Patrick 's Day years ago when Kathleen was having an online affair with an Irish gentleman on AOL Instant Messenger . 
LuckyCharms69 . 
Great guy . And even though Kathleen 's virtual romance ended , we all fell and remained deeply in love with these treats . 
But they are only available in Ireland , so I spend all year combing eBay for them . 
And you only got one box for all of us ? 
Please have your resignation letter and your father badge on my desk in the morning , Beef . 
To avoid a riot , I shall hide these until we can properly divide them up . 
Why weren 't you at school this week , Mr. Golovkin ? 
I mean , don 't get me wrong , I Go-loved it . 
How dare you ? 
I know why he was out . 
A bunch of the teachers had lice . 
[ all exclaim ] - Ew ! 
- That 's nasty . Don 't worry , I 've been to Nits Giggles and I have a clean bill of hair health . 
You realize you are literally scratching your head right now ? 
- [ phone rings ] Hello . 
Yes , sweetheart , I ... 
Oh , no , we haven 't been listening . Yep , yep . Okay , see you soon . 
Beef , turn on the weather band . 
[ announcer ] The storm has been upgraded to a category five . 
Residents are urged to shelter in place and take - all necessary precautions . - [ all exclaim ] Uh-oh . 
A storm ? Like a " snowed in " storm ? Mr. Golovkin , can you drop me off ? 
I can 't get stuck here for this crap again . 
When these guys get snowed in , they go full wonkers in the conkers . [ scoffs ] Us ? 
No . But maybe someone should maybe hide all the sharps . [ laughs ] No reason . Come on , Mr. G , let 's roll . 
Oh ! Oh , no . 
- [ Moon growls ] - Ow ! Moon , the lights have only been off for two seconds . - Stop biting my legs . 
Ow ! 
Moon , not my beautiful butt . 
- [ bell rings ] - [ all shout ] 
Captain on deck . Uh-oh , what 's this gonna be ? 
Dad , may I be the first to say , sick fit . 
Thank you , son . 
As Jerry noted earlier , during ice storms , blizzards , and blackouts of all kinds , we Tobins have indeed been known to get a little ... Big silly style in our head tanks ? 
Beautifully said , son . 
But it wasn 't until the last one , when we had guests , that I realized how shameful our behavior is . 
So , as the captain of this family , I have come up with a foolproof plan . 
Okay , a plan could be good . 
During this storm , we will be dressing and acting according to the rules of the most efficiently regulated maritime organization in the world : the Royal British Navy . 
That 's your idea ? 
Well , you know the saying : " Any idea my dad has is perfect . " 
There will be no chaos , no Moon Courts ... What 's Moon Court ? 
Oh , it 's a court ruled over by a child , but all the adults take it seriously . 
Sustained . There will also be no eating of people , no eating of sweets ... 
- [ gasps ] What ? - What ? 
I mutiny . 
Me , too . That sucks , Dad . 
No mutinies allowed . 
Three healthy meals a day will be provided . 
Uh , Dad , you have been known to actually get the most loggins in the noggins of any of us . Yeah , like when you became convinced you had " the same illness Tim Allen had in The Santa Clause . " 
Or when you made us stay awake for 36 hours to avoid what you called " storm snakes " 
who " feed on sleep . " 
Yes , during storms past , I let myself go crazy , but I assure you , this plan will help me keep my mind right . 
The Tobin household is now a Royal British Navy vessel , call sign : HMS Perfect Family . 
I am her captain . Moon is her first mate . 
Don 't try to butter me up . 
Judy , you 're first " looftenant , " as the Brits say . 
Ham , second " looftenant . " 
Honeybee and Wolf , co-third " looftenants . " Yes , I 'm my Dad 's third . 
Babe ? Uh-uh . 
And to make up for last time , Jerry shall take on a comfortable role as my best friend and personal confidant . 
[ groans ] Fine . 
Golovkin , since you have lice , you will be a barrel boy . 
And what is a barrel boy ? 
A diseased boy in a barrel . 
But since we have no barrel , you can ride this out in the brig . 
We should burn his clothes , too . 
Fine by me . My whole outfit cost three dollars . 
Perfect . Jerry , I offer you this book and pen for recordkeeping . 
And I also offer you my reassurance that we will all act very normally for the duration of the storm . 
I do not believe you and , in fact , think you have already gone crazy . 
Well , I can 't wait to prove you wrong . 
Welcome aboard the HMS Perfect Family , troops . 
The voyage begins upon my bell . 
Oh , sail yeah . 
Ah , what a fine , brisk day at sea , is it not , Jerry ? 
Everything very calm , very normal . 
Yep , just one of those normal days dressing your children in jaunty little sailor outfits and pretending the house is a ship . 
Dad , I don 't want to get ahead of myself , but so far this has been better than slowly descending into madness . See ? I told you all that a little order would go a long way . 
Honestly , I was worried about you , Dad , but you know I love chores . 
And usually by now I 'd have chugged two full bottles of maple syrup , and me and Judy would be fist-fighting about who was the best Bachelor . 
- It was Brad Womack . 
- It 's Lorenzo Borghese . 
This is why you 're single . 
Borghese ? 
More like Barf-ghese . 
Speaking of barfing , I wouldn 't mind getting my hands on all 48 of those Coddingham Creme Potatoes . 
Captain Father , shall we set a course to the Potato Creme Bay ? 
We don 't need sugar , First Mate Moon , we need structure . 
Jerry , take an entry into the captain 's log . 
Day one aboard the HMS Perfect Family . 
We set sail mere hours ago , and morale is high . 
No signs of slappy fights , scurvy , purple-nurples , cannibalism , or Moon Court . 
Even our louse-ridden barrel boy is well cared for . 
I daresay my plan is perfection . 
Day two commences . The sailors happily enjoy a hearty breakfast of plain oatmeal and a refreshing glass of room temperature water , filling one and all with both vim and vigor . 
Meals are followed by exercise . 
The lunchtime rations of boiled chicken were generous , as were the spirits of the crew . 
I know this routine is supposed to keep our brains from turning to goo , but I 'm starting to feel like one of those animals that runs on a wheel , you know ? Like a , uh ... 
- Hamster ? 
- Yes , Judester ? 
No , I ... Never mind . 
Excuse me for a moment , sailors . 
I must prepare the afternoon 's entertainment . 
I agree with Ham . 
All this boiled food and cleaning is not making me less restless . 
Don 't worry , my cooped up Catherine , 
Dad has absolutely everything under control . 
[ laughs ] I don 't think so . 
How dare you not think so ? 
Guys , it is very obvious that your dad is slowly going mad . 
Like Dad Dad ? No . He 's specifically not getting wobbled in his bobble . 
Haven 't you ever seen Mutiny on the Bounty ? Or-or Cast Away ? 
Your dad is seconds away from frenching a volleyball . 
- Maritime lecture , ahoy . 
Welcome , sailors , to the captain 's lecture series . 
To properly swab , first thing you 'll need is a bucket of hot , soapy water . 
Soak up the hot , soapy water with a mop and a back-and-forth swabbing-like fashion ... your azimuth compass and set your mop 's course due north-northeast ... 
This is pure teak , so you 're gonna be sanding with a hollystone ... Ugh . He 's been lecturing us on swabbing for hours . 
He just keeps repeating himself . What is going on ? 
[ Beef ] [ clears throat ] Something to say , " Looftenant " ? 
Oh , uh , just , you know , there 's a lot of swabbing information happening here , and I think we got it . 
Well , then , let 's put our wet rags where our mouths are . 
In fact , tonight 's meal will be delayed so that we can swab the walls , the countertops , the individual coins in the swear jar , and the rafters . 
Oh , boy . 
[ Honeybee ] Guys , I think Golovkin was right . 
Maybe your dad is starting to go a little , uh , you know ... Master and Bananas ? 
I 'm sure he has a very good reason for keeping a stuffed parrot on his shoulder and speaking with it and sometimes kissing it . 
What 's that , Darius ? 
- Good one , my fine bird . 
Look , if Dad 's getting a little loose in the brain caboose , maybe that 's to our advantage . 
[ clears throat ] Father ? On behalf of the crew , I am humbly requesting we each be allowed one small treat with our evening meal . 
Perhaps one of the Coddingham Creme Potatoes ? 
Ship 's historian , best friend and personal confidant ? 
Yes ? Shall I get the potatoes ? [ chuckles ] No . Take a log / letter . 
Dear First Mate Moon , request denied . 
You bastard . 
Come on , Dad . We 've been trapped inside for 51 hours . Yeah . 
And all we are asking for is one tiny , itty-bitty treat to get us through till the power comes back on . 
And also to get our phones back and not to do any more work and no more lectures . 
Absolutely not . 
This is my voyage and we will stay this course . 
- Told you . 
- Silence , Barrel Boy . 
I 'm noticing that the trim around the baseboards of the ship is dirty . 
Let us clean it all before bedtime . 
Jerry , please go and get a pack of toothbrushes from the basement . 
[ snoring ] [ bell rings ] [ all exclaiming ] 
Pirates of the Crap-ibbean : Curse of the What the Hell ? 
Dad , it 's 4 : 00 in the morning . 
It 's time to scrub the galley . 
[ all groan ] Jerry , take a log . 
Day three begins before dawn , with all and sundry cheered by my buoyant leadership . 
[ giggles ] [ cackles ] [ kisses ] 
The troops have pleased me today , and so Darius , my shoulder companion , encouraged me to reconsider - my dessert edict . 
- Yes . 
Dark chocolate ? That 's disgusting . 
It 's basically a vegetable . 
Now , if you could all excuse me , I have a private captain 's matter to attend to . 
Also please note that today , when I was on the phone with Mrs. Claus , she told me the snow snakes are back and they don 't like smiles . 
So , just something to keep in mind . 
Okay , enough . 
That man is full melon in the cerebellum . 
This ends now . 
[ Wolf ] Moon , what you doing , bud ? 
You can 't kill Dad , we 've been over this . 
Oh , God , no . - [ others gasp ] 
[ Moon ] You sick son of a boat captain . 
You ate 48 candy potatoes ? 
[ gasps ] No , this isn 't what it looks like . 
I found them like this . 
Save it , Dad . 
I 'm afraid you 've been caught brown-handed . 
While your crew goes hungry , you 're gorging yourself on Coddingham Creme Potatoes , only available on another continent or the Potato Dark Web . 
I didn 't eat them , I swear . 
I only came down here to grab more swab supplies . I thought , after your dessert , we could swab each other and the snakes . 
And Mrs. Claus could use a swabbing , if I 'm honest . 
Captain , we are relieving you of your duties , effective immediately . What ? 
You can 't mean ... Oh , we can mean . 
You say " potato , " we say " mutiny-tah-tah-to . " 
And you know what ? I believe that I would actually like to press charges . 
- [ Judy ] Me , too . 
- [ Wolf ] And I. 
[ chuckles ] You may have kept us from going mad but not from getting mad . 
You said no Moon Court , but you didn 't say no Moon Court-Martial . 
- You better lawyer up , pal . 
Darius , don 't say another word . 
- [ gavel bangs ] - [ Moon ] Order . 
Order . This special court-martial tribunal is now called to order . 
I recognize the plaintiffs : Ham , Judy , and Wolf Tobin , who are the victims of the defendant , Captain Beef Tenderloin Tobin , who is guilty . 
You can 't say I 'm guilty before the trial starts . Overruled . 
Who will represent the plaintiffs in this case ? 
- I will , Your Honor . 
- Sustained . 
And who will represent this disgusting potato hog , who is the worst and very guilty , case dismissed ? 
All right , 
I shall proceed with the sentencing to death . 
Come on , somebody ? Jerry , please . 
[ sighs ] All right . 
Court stenographer , Diseased Barrel Boy , please read the charges . 
Captain Beef Tobin stands here accused of being a nasty little potato hog , oink-oink . - Sustained . 
- Judge Moon , if it pleases the court , 
I have something to say . 
I 'll allow it , Barrel Boy . 
I feel the need to point out that it is usually the mutineers who are court - martialed and not the captain . 
Hmm , is that so ? 
Well , if you 're such a huge fan of the captain , why don 't you join him as a defendant ? - Wait , what ? 
- You are hereby charged with being pretentious and a teacher at my school . Sustained . 
Please sit right next to my father , - same chair . - But he has lice . 
Oh , is that so ? 
Well , a trial on that matter will be set on the dumbteenth of stupid . 
But who will be the stenographer ? [ Dirt ] I 'll do it . - [ others scream ] - [ Ham ] A stowaway . 
Aunt Dirt , where the hell did you come from ? 
Oh , I came over to the main house right after the blizzard started , but when I peeked my head into the kitchen and saw everyone was doing chores dressed as Scientologists , 
I had my gun , my flask , my backup flask , so I was all set . 
But the flasks ran out , and this seems kind of fun . 
So now I 'm in . 
Sustained . 
Aunt Dirt is recognized as the court stenographer and also the jury . 
Motion to also be a publicly intoxicated loudmouth ? 
- So granted . - [ burps ] 
Yee-haw , your highness . 
If there are no further motions at this time , The trial of Beef Tenderloin Tobin for being a horrible captain and nasty spud piggy is called to order . 
[ Moon ] Counselor Honeybee , your opening statement , please . 
Your Honor , gentlelady of the jury . - Present . - Let me begin by asking you a question . 
What do we mean when we say " potato pig " ? 
Webster 's defines " filthy potato pig " as follows : a man with a red beard and no soul who used an ice storm to starve and torture his own children , their gorgeous wives ... 
Guilty as described . 
And while I sometimes say " I rest my case " just for fun , in this case I do rest my case because every single person in this room , except Aunt Dirt , saw this little potato piggy Beef Tobin down on all fours just piggin ' those potatoes , slurping that potato slop , - in his little piggy sty ... - Objection . On what grounds ? 
I didn 't do it . 
You should 've thought of that before you did it . 
So , in conclusion , this little piggy went to the basement , this little piggy ate chocolates , and those Coddingham Creme Potatoes went wee-wee-wee all the way to his stomach . 
In your face , and I do rest my case . 
Your Honor , may I approach the bench to kiss my wife ? Overruled . 
Jerry , your opening and closing statements , please . 
I call to the opening and closing statement stand , - Captain Beef Tobin . - Objection . 
He can 't call a witness during his opening statement . 
That 's hearsay , Your Honor . Huh . 
I 'll allow it . 
Dad , please take the witness stand . 
Now , Beef , you are , in fact , just a man , is that right ? 
- Guilty . - Objection . 
I 'll render the verdicts around here . 
Sustained . 
And like any other man , you like chocolates , particularly novelty chocolates , is that right ? I 've been known to dabble with the devil in the brown dress , yes . 
And so , you , as you admitted , just a man , had been at sea for three days , burdened with overwhelming responsibilities and an ungrateful crew , is that right ? 
Indeed . 
Even though Santa bit me , and I 'm slowly becoming him , like Timothy Allen . Darius was so worried . 
[ chuckles ] Of course he was . 
Aw , he 's going for the insanity defense ? [ sighs ] Brilliant . 
And under that kind of pressure , you went down to the basement to get the swabbing supplies , but then there it was , an unopened box of four dozen 
So you thought , " What could be the harm ? I 'll just have one . " But they 're so good , just the right balance of chocolate and minty cream filling to soothe a warped mind , that you just kept going back . 
You didn 't want to do it , no , you did not , but you were insane from the storm and from trying to take care of all these insubordinate scallywags . 
Scallywags , please murmur angrily . 
These sailors you trusted , that you loved like they were your own children , well , they hurt you , didn 't they , Captain Tobin ? - Didn 't they ? 
- Yes . 
It makes me sick . 
They swabbed the deck , but they couldn 't swab their own hearts . 
In closing , you must find Beef Tobin not guilty by reason of insanity . 
Who could blame this sad shell of a man for seeking out a little bit of chocolate-covered joy in this crazy snowed-in world ? I know I can 't . I won 't ! [ crying ] 
It 's like the leprechaun 's limerick inscribed upon the Creme Potato says , " Potatoes are the root vegetable of all happiness . " [ gasps ] 
And I do rest my case . 
I 'm so sorry , potato papa . We 're gonna get you the help you need . 
Damn it , Jerry 's good . 
We will now move on to sentencing . 
Moon , wait , I have new evidence . I know who ate the potatoes . 
It was you , Jerry . - [ others gasp ] 
- No , don 't listen to this man . 
Three days ago , when the potatoes came , Jerry said he 'd never seen one before . 
The only way he would know about the leprechaun 's limerick would be if he ate the potatoes himself . - [ others gasp ] - Oh , dang . 
- [ Moon ] Order . 
Order . 
Order me some popcorn ' cause this is getting good . 
[ Moon ] The trial of Jerry Shaw for stealing and eating Coddingham Creme Potatoes is now in session . 
Jerry , how do you plead ? Not guilty . I 'm Jerry . 
As was stated earlier , I never do anything wrong . 
Liar ! Murderer ! 
Judy , don 't , it 's not worth it . 
That 's not how we get justice . Who will be representing Mr. Shaw ? I 'll take the case , but if it pleases the court , 
I 'll be pretending to be my favorite lawyer , the lead character from the 1961 TV show 
Shirley Dunn , Lady Lawyer with a Gun . She waves her gun around a lot and occasionally shoots a juror . 
Court is pleased . Continue . Honeybee , your opening statement . Oh , uh , same statements as before , but about my brother this time . 
Lady Lawyer , you 're up . 
- [ others scream ] 
- The defense rests . Hey , you 're supposed to defend me . 
No can do , buckaroo . 
I saw you eating those potatoes . - The court will now gasp . 
- [ others gasp ] 
Last night I went down to the basement looking for cigarettes and nudie mags , and that 's when I saw ... Toothbrushes , toothbrushes ... Ooh . 
[ laughs ] You all think I 'm so sweet . 
Perfect little angel baby Jerry would never eat a stolen candy potato . 
[ laughs ] That 's how I got away with it for so long . - It wasn 't that long . 
- I did it because of him ! 
Beef , you promised me a better Tobin snowed-in experience , and this was not that . 
I was just sitting around , taking your logs , while you slowly went bonkers in every single tonker you possessed . 
Yes , I ate the potatoes with my actual mouth , but I was driven to do it by Beef . 
They might as well be swimming around in his tummy . 
I 'm not guilty by reason of Beef being a bad captain , and , in closing , I put Beef back on trial . 
He is guilty . The end . 
- So ordered . 
- What ? 
[ Moon ] Honeybee , your opening and closing statements . 
Same statement as last time and the other time , but about Beef again . 
In your face , and I rest my case . 
Will anyone defend my father , the potato pig ? - I will act as my own counsel . 
- Proceed . 
Yes , I admit it . 
This was probably the most crazy I ever acted . 
In fact , I was probably literally nuts from the moment I came in here in my little white suit . I knew it ! 
And I do , in fact , sentence myself to death . 
So granted . But , before I walk the plank , 
I must make my real confession . 
I told a rank and abhorrent lie a few days ago , and I cannot die with that sin upon my soul . 
There are , in fact , a whole bunch more potatoes in the basement that I was hoarding for myself , and I cannot ... Court adjourned . Aunt Dirt , shoot anyone who follows me . 
Consider it done . Shirley Dunn . Moon , don 't you dare eat those potatoes . 
Damn it , I 'm out of bullets . 
Get him , everybody , get him . - [ panting ] 
- Moon , get back here . Don 't think I won 't bite a child . 
[ Ham ] No , come on . Give me those potatoes . 
Oop . Hey . 
Power 's back on . I definitely still have lice . 
I believe we all do . 
[ Beef ] Well , it seems my British Royal Navy idea worked pretty well after all . 
Beef , respectfully , what the hell are you talking about ? 
No one died , no one ate anyone , and the house is very clean . Pretty good , right , guys ? 
Oh , yeah , Dad , best storm yet . Terrific . 
Now , if you 'll excuse me , 
I have to go see how the elves are doing . 
It 's only a few days till Christmas , and we are way behind on wooden ducks . Dad , please go lie down . 
You got it . 
Ho ho ho . 
Merry Christmas , everybody .
