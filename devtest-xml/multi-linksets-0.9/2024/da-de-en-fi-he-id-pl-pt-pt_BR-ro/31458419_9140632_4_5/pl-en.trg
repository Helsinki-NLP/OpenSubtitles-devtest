[ Wolf ] Thanks for stopping by Cheesecake 's with me . I just want to check on him . 
He hasn 't texted me back in a few weeks - and I 'm a little worried . 
- Of course . But remember , I am not staying for drinks . 
I 'm still a little annoyed about him eating my passport the last time we all partied . 
That was hilarious . Even better than the time he ate my passport . 
- What a specific craving . 
- I will never understand how much you love Cheesecake , babe . But a friend of yours is a friend of mine . 
Cheesecake is just pure fun . 
He 's like , you know , if a piñata was a living man . 
Uh-oh , how 'd you find me , Officer ? 
I can explain everything . [ chuckles ] 
Get in here . 
Hey , pal , what 's going on ? 
I texted you a bunch of YouTubes of news anchors farting on air , and not a single LOL . 
Oh , I guess I forgot to pay my dang bill . Lost my wallet . 
Set it down in a wallet store , and , well , you can see what happened there . 
Let me get you two a cocktail . 
You guys got to try this hangover cure I invented . 
You drink gin out of a bowl , and that tricks the body into thinking it 's getting soup , which is healthy . 
None for me . 
My new passport just came in the mail , - so I need my wits about me . 
- Suit yourself . 
[ Wolf ] Looks like you have some past-due bills here , - huh , bud ? 
- Oh , yeah . You know how these companies like to play hardball . You can 't give in to their demands . - Aah ! - What the ... 
Cheesecake ! - Aah ! - Quick question : is it possible that your RV is being repossessed ? 
This is a bluff . 
They 're bluffing . 
I 'm sorry , Cheesecake , but you haven 't made a payment on the RV in seven months . 
Okay , true , but a heads-up would 've been nice . 
I told you a dozen times to your face that I was gonna have to tow this thing away . 
I thought we were doing a bit . 
I don 't understand . Aren 't you loaded ? 
What happened to that 350,000 bucks from the settlement when that snowplow hit you ? 
Yeah , you said you 'd never have to work again . 
Oh , it seems I misunderstood . 
The settlement I received was actually 35 grand , which I thought was just a cute way of saying $ 350,000 . 
So it turns out I 've spent all my money except $ 11 . 
Well , don 't worry , you can stay with us for a few days and ... Uh , uh , Wolf , is there someone you 'd like to check with - before making that offer ? 
- Oh , Dad 'll totally be cool with it . 
- I meant me ! 
- Guys , I 'll be fine . 
I can just stay at that beachfront drainpipe . It hasn 't rained that much recently , so I 'm good . 
- Honeybee . 
- Ugh , fine . I guess you can stay with us . 
But just until you figure something out . 
Great . Let me just grab my gin bowl and ... And you will drink your gin out of a glass , mixed with tonic and lime , just like everyone else . 
- [ people laughing ] - [ Carissa ] Oh , Dorothy . 
Hear ye , hear ye . The clothing swap is now in session . 
- Beef , you go . 
- Okay . I brought a 10 x 14 waxed canvas tarp that can become a poncho during a sudden downpour . Ooh , gimme . 
I 'd love to embarrass my daughter by wearing that in public . 
I bet you 'd look good in canvas tan . 
Beef , are you flirting with Carissa ? 
What ? ! N-No . 
I genuinely think she 'd look great in a tarp . What an unusual but fun compliment . 
Now stop embarrassing him , Dorothy . If he turns any redder , we 're gonna have to take him to the emergency room . 
[ clears throat ] Uh , you , uh , finally opened your new coffee shop , Carissa . 
That 's exciting . 
How are things going down there ? 
Oh , it 's not going that good . 
We don 't have regulars yet and the tourists off the cruises just seem to pass us by . 
Well , maybe we could all stop in and spend a little dough . 
- Oh , sure . - Sure . 
Thanks , guys . 
Okay , my turn . 
Who wants it ? It 's casual , but you could dress it up with some stilettos . 
- Quick meeting under the covers ? 
- Schedule 's wide open . 
Okay , what 's the plan ? 
Cheesecake can 't sleep in a Snorks sleeping bag in our living room forever . 
Don 't worry , sweetie . 
I 've been through this kind of stuff with him before , and Cheesy-C always lands on his feet . 
Besides , that 's our thing . 
I 'm there for him , he 's there for me . 
I 've seen half of that , Babe . When has Cheesecake ever done something for ... - Hey , guys . Quick threesome ? 
- Aah ! - Aah ! JK , JK . [ laughs ] 
Sorry to startle you , but I just woke up to a text with some great news . 
My cousin Porch is gonna hook me up with a job - as a deep-sea crab fisherman ! 
- Oh , uh ... I guess the greenhorn just got decapitated by an icy net . So the job 's all mine . 
How lucky am I ? 
Uh , so lucky . 
[ chuckles ] All right , sleep tight . 
Uh , follow-up meeting , right now , same location ? 
Oh , man , oh , man , I can 't let my BFF do this . 
He does not have the stuff to make it on a crab boat . 
Look , why don 't we take him out on our boat tomorrow and see how he does ? 
Maybe he 'll turn out to be a secret genius at it and there 's nothing to worry about . 
Hell yeah . Maybe he 's a Good Will Fishing . 
[ Beef ] Wolf , I need you and Honeybee to prep the boat this morning . 
- I 'll be a little late . 
- Aye aye , Father . 
That 's actually perfect , because Cheesecake got a job on a crab boat , so we were gonna give him a little taste of the seafaring life . 
A job ? 
Cheesecake ? 
That 's hilarious . 
What are you gonna do , operate him from under his hat - like Ratatouille ? 
- Ooh , could we ? 
Both of you ? 
You 're gonna break the poor guy 's neck . 
Well , I am visiting Carissa 's fancy new coffee shop on the way to the docks this morning to support her by spending a couple of bucks on a cup of joe . 
Classy . 
Want to borrow one of my berets ? 
- Oh , God , do I need one ? 
- Definitely . 
And when they ask for your name for your cup , say " Jean-Luc Picard . " 
Definitely do that , Dad . 
Oh , I see . You 're making fun of me . - What ? 
No . Uh-uh . - Oh , Dad , no , we would never . 
Black coffee , please , miss . 
Aw , Beef , you really came by to support me . 
Love the name . [ chuckles ] Scone Moose . 
It 's like Lone Moose , but a scone is a food that you sell here . 
Look at you , nailing it . 
You know , I 'm headed to the boat to meet Honeybee and Wolf , so throw in two more large coffees and four chocolate croissants . 
Wolf always needs two or he says the other hand gets jealous . 
And I 'll be back tomorrow for more , okay ? 
I 'd love to see you tomorrow . But promise me you 'll actually come in ? 
Well , I 've never hung out inside a cool coffee shop like this before , since I 'm not actor Ethan Hawke , but you have my word . 
Hey , Cheesecake . How you holding up ? 
Oh , man , oh , man , oh , man . I 'm so seasick . 
Huh , that 's uh , a little worrisome , since we haven 't even left shore . 
- Yeah . - Uh , you know what , Cheesecake ? 
Uh , me and Honeybee are actually gonna help you get a job right here in Lone Moose . 
- We are ? - Yep . Honeybee , I can 't let my best friend get beheaded by an icy net . 
That is , like , the first rule of friendship . 
All right , I guess I can help get him signed up at a temp agency . 
Thank you . 
This is incredible . 
I just need a brand-new job before Friday . 
That 's when I 'm supposed to ship out . 
Ooh , is being Spider-Man a job ? 
He seems to have fun . 
Okay , I 'm gonna role-play with Wolf so you can see exactly how to act at an interview . 
You have three set up for this afternoon through that temp service I found , so focus . 
Honeybee , what would you say your greatest strength is ? 
My greatest strength , hmm , is I 'm a problem solver . 
Now , see , this is where you brag about what you 're good at . Don 't hold back . 
[ Cheesecake ] I 'd say my greatest strength is that you can throw anything at me and I won 't flinch . 
Throw that stapler at me . 
I don 't want to throw a stapler at you . 
And what would you say is your biggest weakness ? 
I would say that my biggest weakness is that I 'm too invested in my work . 
This is where you pretend to be too good at something and it isn 't really a flaw . 
[ Cheesecake ] Oh , that 's easy . 
My biggest weakness is that I drink too much . 
Uh , well , yeah , what you do at home is ... 
Oh , no , no , no . I drink at work , too . 
You want one ? 
And it 's always good to ask them a few questions , too . 
[ Cheesecake ] Do I have questions ? 
Uh , yeah . Do you think I 'd look good with bangs ? 
Be honest . 
I actually have to wrap this up . 
Do it ! Do it , you coward ! 
- Throw that stapler ! 
One plain bran muffin and one black coffee for this absolute wild man . 
So , now what should I do ? 
[ chuckles ] Um , sit down and people-watch ? 
Is there someone suspicious you want me to keep an eye on , specifically ? 
Holy Christmas , you are overthinking this , you big red weirdo . 
Hey , man , can you keep an eye on my laptop for me while I 'm in the bathroom ? 
Sir , you have my word . 
No harm shall come to your machine . Not on my watch . 
Uh , okay . 
She 's safe , my friend . All right . 
Uh , thanks again , man . 
It was my honor . 
We have bonded over a shared moral code , and now the day may come for him to watch my lap computer . 
Welp , that was a bust . 
Let 's face it , I 'm a party guy , not an office guy . 
All right , well , I 'll talk to Dad tonight about adding a room on to the cabin , so you can live here since you didn 't get any offers . Oh , no , I got an offer from the pretzel place , but you never want to take the first one , right ? 
- Oh , my God . 
- Call them . Call them back . 
Yep . Sure , I could start tomorrow . Sounds good . - I have a job ! 
[ whoops ] - Yay ! 
- Yay ! 
Should we go out and get very , very drunk to celebrate ? 
Cheesecake , now that you 've got the job , you got to make choices that 'll help you keep the job . Smart , Honeybee . I 'll want to be fresh , so let 's just get drunk here . 
- Ooh , Curacao . 
- Cheesecake , that 's Windex ! Ugh . 
How is he gonna get through a whole day of work ? 
It 's too bad you can 't really Ratatouille him . 
[ gasps ] Honeybee , maybe we can . 
But we 're gonna need a few more rats . 
Namely , my siblings . 
[ groans ] I hate this idea and I don 't even know what it is yet . 
It is Windex , you were right . 
Okay , earpiece is in . 
Come in , Team Cheese . 
- Do you copy ? 
- Loud and clear . 
[ Cheesecake ] Uh-oh , boss lady ahoy . 
Cheesecake , great to see you again . 
Plenty more where that came from . 
If you know what I mean , wink , wink . [ chuckles ] 
- Oh , boy . 
- He 's just warming up . 
[ Valentina ] So , as I mentioned , this is a temporary position but it could become full-time . This is your desk . 
Oh . [ chuckles ] He never comes out here . 
This is the CEO of Alaska Pretzels , Mr. Slimsac . 
Uh , Mr. Slimsac , this is Cheesecake . He 's our new receptionist . 
Don 't steal , don 't snoop , don 't call the health department . 
Wouldn 't dream of it . 
Not that I 'm dreaming about you . 
N-Not that that 's bad . 
I 'm sure plenty of people dream about you . - And I can see why . 
- [ sighs ] Sure . 
Okay , well , once you 're settled , please make collated copies of these . 
You got it . 
Okay , I was panicking . I did not hear a word she said . 
Guys , 911 . 
The lady asked me to do something . 
Hold tight . 
Okay , guys , Cheesecake needs our help . 
This is what we 're here for . 
Not me . I 'm just here ' cause I passed out in the van . 
And we 're just here ' cause we got to skip school . 
Technically not skipping . I told Principal Gibbons that Aunt Dirt died . 
- You wish . 
- And you 're still paying us 20 bucks each , right ? 
I said ten . 
Oh , shall I call Dad , then ? 
Aren 't you supposed to be on the boat ? 
Fine . 20 . 
- Thirty . 
- Okay . 
- I only agreed to do this to solve the Cheesecake problem once and for all , so let 's go . 
Okay , Cheesecake , what do you remember about the instructions ? 
Oh God , I think she said either the word copy or coffee ? 
- Cheesecake , this is Ham . 
- Ham , I 'm scared . 
It 's gonna be okay . 
Now , do you see either papers or a coffee maker ? 
- That could be a big clue . 
- Yes . There 's a stack of papers here . 
That 's real good , bud . 
I think she wants you to make copies . 
Let 's head on over to the copy machine . 
Lot of machines in here , guys . 
- Judy , we need your eyes here . 
Judy just texted you a photo . 
Find the thing that looks like that . 
Uh , I got it . I got it . 
Okay , headed over . 
Just gonna grab a little sip of water . 
Oh , no . Oh , God ! I swallowed my earpiece ! 
Uh-oh , we 're losing signal . We 're losing signal ! 
Cheesecake , no . 
Oh , look who 's back . Is it our second date , Beef ? 
Oh , uh ... [ chuckles ] I , uh ... 
I 'm just kidding . [ chuckles ] Sorry , the cruise ships are here today , so I am trying to keep it fun . 
Hi , welcome to Scone Moose . 
Hi , we just got off the cruise ship and we couldn 't help but notice him through the window . 
Are we allowed to talk to your Alaskan man ? 
[ Carissa ] Who , Beef ? 
Yes . He 's not an exhibit . 
Beef ? 
Wow . What a rugged name . 
Oh , he 's so authentic . 
He is , right ? 
And really nice . 
The kind of guy who would take time out of his day to come support you , not like your stupid ex who watched reruns of Grace Under Fire all day and told you your dreams were dumb . 
Oh , uh , I guess . 
And handsome . Like , in a way , like , you didn 't notice before but now , suddenly , you 're , like , maybe ? 
Uh , what does he order ? 
He usually just gets a coffee and a muffin . 
Ooh , okay . Yes , we 'll take that . 
Oh , and also a few croissants and he loves those keychains . 
Yeah , he puts them on all of his axes . 
Oh , we need those . 
Oh , and he loves mugs . 
This is the kind he uses . 
Only , uh , $ 30 . 
Uh-huh . We 'll take two . 
- Okay . 
- Oh , your hand . 
It 's like if leather was sandpaper . 
Hi . Hello , hi . 
I 'm here from Silicon Valley on a cruise and I would love to take a picture with you . 
Uh , sure . 
Okay , here we go , but don 't do kissy lips . That 's my thing . 
Beefcake , you 're a hit . 
You sitting in the window is like a lure for cruise ship tourists . 
That 's a fishing reference . You 're welcome . 
And the people love it . 
I love it . 
You , uh , love it ? 
Yeah , yeah , like , as a friend who loves their friend who 's making them money . 
Of course . 
Yes . Can you lean even more into the Alaskan man thing a little bit ? 
Like , tell people about a bear you fought and how you , like , respected him and he respected you . 
Both of those things are true . 
Cheesecake , it 's me , Honeybee . 
I 'm not really a delivery person . Something in this box is gonna help you , so please focus because I need my life back . 
[ loudly ] Sign here . 
Okay , the box is gonna help me , so I just look at it or ... 
Oh , maybe I burn it ? [ Moon ] No ! 
- Moon ? 
- Don 't call me Moon . For the rest of the day , I 'm a normal , everyday office plant . 
I 'll sit right by your desk and guide you . 
Okay , we have eyes and ears again , people . 
Uh-oh . We 've got boss . 
You there , uh , temp , can you email me the marketing report ? 
Uh , uh-huh . Email . I love it and I 've used it before . 
[ whoops ] Great response . 
All right , good . I got to get back on the floor . 
Guess there 's some " poison " in the dough today , so another nightmare for me . 
[ Moon ] Okay , email . 
Let 's begin by turning on the computer . 
Wow , Beef , this has been my best day at the shop since I opened . 
You know , I can keep coming back every day , if you want . 
But what about your boat ? 
Oh , the boat ? 
Pfft . Boat . What boat ? 
Pfft . Beef , come on . 
Okay , yes , I care about my boat intensely . 
My son has been captaining it for a few days , but I am filled with jealousy and having nightmares that the boat is calling him Dad . 
[ chuckles ] You are a deeply weird man and I enjoy it . 
But , Beef , fishing is your actual job . You got to get back to it . 
Also , how much cash have you spent here these last two days ? 
Oh , not much . Just $ 197 . 
Beef ! I can 't let you keep doing that . As much as I would love to . 
And I would love to , too . But how about this ? 
I come back and sit in your window every two weeks when the cruise ships dock ? 
Perfect . 
And if you miss me too much in between , you can ... take me out to dinner ? 
Because it turns out I like it when you spend money on me . 
I 'm very greedy . Very shallow . 
Sure . I 'm also very shallow . 
I like eating dinner with gorgeous model types who own their own businesses . 
Okay , that was almost , like , smooth . 
Are you feeling okay ? 
Oh , I am definitely feeling okay . Hi , excuse me . 
Could I just snip a little piece of your beard for my scrapbook ? 
As long as you also order whatever the hell a cold brew is , be my guest . 
[ Valentina ] All right . Good first day today . 
You did all the jobs and , more importantly , you didn 't call OSHA about stuff you saw like the last temp . 
Oh , and that weird new plant you brought really livens the place up . 
Thank you . 
It 's my friend 's brother ... ' s . You know , we 've been trying to fill this position for a while and , well , you are acceptable . 
So if you want , we can make this a full-time job . 
- We did it ! - Oh , my God , we did it ! 
All right , Wolf , you saved Cheesecake . Take a bow . I will take ... this whole crew out to dinner at Maude 's . And the cheesecake 's on me . 
- Babe , no . 
- Babe , yes . 
All right guys , Cheesecake 's out celebrating , so this is the perfect time for us to strategize and tighten up our game for tomorrow . 
Tomorrow ? 
Oh , sorry . The day after today . 
I know what the word " tomorrow " means , Wolf . 
Let 's start with Judy . 
I 'd love to see a little more hustle , okay ? 
Um ... Aunt Dirt , maybe you could actually help tomorrow ? 
Maybe not , hot shot . Okay . 
Could you at least fart less ? 
- Dream on , bitch . - Right . Moon , let 's keep innovating . 
Babe , you can 't be serious . You have done enough for your friend . 
And we 've missed enough time on the boat , which is our actual job while we 're waiting for our Shark Tank audition . 
But , no . We just got Cheesecake safe . We can 't stop now . 
Guys , you mind if I talk to Wolf alone ? 
Sweetie , I 'm glad it went well today , and I 'm glad Cheesecake got a full-time job , but for me , the Cheesecake experiment is over . 
But-but Cheesecake needs us . 
Do you not like him or something ? 
No , babe , I do like Cheesecake . I just don 't like the effect he has on you sometimes . 
I mean , you do everything for him and he doesn 't do anything for you . 
What is it with him ? 
It 's just , when you have a friend you made when you were a kid , they 're like your family . 
And when someone 's family , you protect them no matter what . 
And he does do things for me . 
He never forgets my birthday , he bought me three lottery tickets last month and also , when I 'm around him , I can 't be serious . 
I just relax . He 's like a human hot tub full of rum . 
I know it 's hard to understand , but that 's what he does for me . 
I can 't let him down now . 
But babe , you are letting him down . 
When you do everything for someone , you 're kind of not letting them grow on their own . 
It 's called co-dependent , hon , and I 've seen enough Ben Affleck relationships to know it does not work . 
I 'm sorry , Honeybee , but I can 't let Cheesecake die on a crab boat . 
So I 'll go it alone if I have to . 
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I got to go find our Die Hard DVD . 
Might pull a John McClane tomorrow and help Cheesecake from the air ducts . 
[ Valentina ] So , Cheesecake , how 's your afternoon going ? 
- Hang on , buddy . Fun banter coming right up . 
Can 't park in a red zone . 
Move this hunk of junk before you lose it . 
Hey , this is not a hunk of junk . But , okay , moving it before I 'm losing it . Hey , this is not a hunk of junk . But I 'm moving it before I 'm losing it . 
Wait , why did you just say that ? Wait , why did you just say that ? 
I didn 't say anything . 
Why did I say that ? 
Because it 's my job . Have you been drinking ? 
I have not been drinking , sir . I have not been drinking , sir . - Well , not a lot . 
- Cheesecake , no . 
Whoa , whoa , whoa . What the hell was that ? 
You could have killed someone , buddy . 
Yeah , jeez . I really could have . 
Step out of the car . 
So , now I have to go to court and pay some fines and the front of the van is messed up . And you tried to warn me . 
Mr. Bean 's jeans , you were right . 
Look , Wolf , I don 't want to destroy your friendship . In fact , I 'm trying to help it . 
If Cheesecake has to take a risky job because of choices he made , well , that 's how people learn . 
And grow . And your friendship 's gonna survive better if y 'all grow together . 
Like you said , he 's basically family , and family can make it through stuff like this . 
Yeah . I 'll talk to him . 
Okay , but when you do , make sure he 's really awake and hasn 't painted eyeballs on his eyelids again . 
[ chuckles ] Sleepcake . 
Oh , my God , I love when he does that . 
Hey , there he is ... My old pal Wolf . 
Hey , what happened to you today ? 
About that ... We , uh , need to have a talk . 
Okay . Is it about me eating that whole block of Velveeta I found in the fridge that was labeled , " Honeybee 's . Do not touch ? " 
- No . - Good , because I didn 't eat it - or get sick . - Course . Look , as you know , I 've been covering for you our whole lives . 
Hey , the system works . 
But it 's probably got to stop . 
You 're like a brother to me . A-And also like a piñata . A-And a hot tub filled with rum . [ chuckles ] Flattered . 
And you 've literally always been there to cheer me up and keep me going , but it might be time for you to learn how to do things for yourself . 
So you got to go to work alone tomorrow . 
- I understand . 
- You do ? 
You 're not mad ? Like , if I stop doing stuff for you , - we 'll still be buds ? 
- Of course . I don 't expect you to do stuff for me . 
I mean , I like it ' cause I hate doing stuff , but I 'll be around no matter what , - ' cause we are bros . 
- That 's great news . 
Now how about we grab a bowl of gin before we hit the sack ? 
Okay , but only one . I got work tomorrow . 
[ Honeybee ] Well , it 's almost the end of the day . I don 't want to jinx it , but maybe he did okay on his own ? 
- Hi , guys . - Aah ! 
- Aah ! Welp , I got fired . 
Oh , no . You did ? What happened ? 
I sorta accidentally shredded a bunch of important papers and then somehow also shredded the shredder itself . 
Mm , that checks out . 
But , you won 't believe this . 
Right after I got fired , they told me to get out immediately , and I tried , but I walked the wrong way . Wound up on the factory floor , and right when I was like " Hey , this isn 't the outdoors , " I got snagged by this hook thing , and then I was briefly dipped into the white chocolate pretzel-coating vat and I almost drowned . 
Oh , God . 
I tried eating my way out but that only works in cartoons . 
Then I blacked out , and when I woke up , I thought I was in heaven but I was in the back of that pretzel boss 's Camry . 
He thought I was dead so he was pretty surprised to see me sit up . 
But here 's the best part . 
- There 's a best part ? - Yup . Apparently there 's a lot of very unsafe stuff going on down there that they don 't want people to know about . And so , when I woke up , that boss guy yelled at me but he also gave me 200 grand if I signed something that said I wouldn 't sue them . 
Cheesecake , that 's incredible . 
Let me see the check . 
Okay , this is $ 20,000 . 
You have got to learn your numbers . - And I 'll help you . 
- Wolf . 
Wait , nope , you can learn numbers on your own . 
But you really did it all by yourself . 
Aw , I 'm so proud of you . 
Your head is gonna stay right here , where it belongs . On your neck in Lone Moose . 
Yeah , I guess you kinda did it . 
All right ! 
Let 's hit the bar . Drinks are on me . 
And by me , I mean you because it 's gonna take some time - for this check to clear . 
- We haven 't even had dinner yet . 
Then we better get over there . 
We got to put down a base of alcohol to absorb the food . 
Aw , what the hell , let 's do it .
