I 'm Diondra Tundra , coming to you live from the oldest bar in Lone Moose , the Toe in the Snow Tavern , where people have been hot-footing it in to sign up for tomorrow night 's annual 
I 'm joined by bar owner Pamela Suggs and by the body part that gives her bar its name . 
Tell us about it , Pamela . 
It was my great-great-great - grandfather 's toe . 
He accidentally chopped it off when he was building this place . 
He put it in a jar , and it 's been sitting on the bar ever since . 
I love you , Pappy Suggs . 
Well , there you have it . 
Be sure to get a sitter and designate a driver because tomorrow night Lone Moose cuts loose . 
I am so stoked to enter my first Chug n ' Tug . 
I 've been doing throat-loosening exercises all week . 
By tomorrow night , I 'll be able to put anything down this gullet . 
A hammer , a ... a big hammer . You name it . Please don 't swallow a hammer , son . 
I 'm excited , too . 
I mean , I don 't think we 'll win ' cause apparently Craig Ptarmigan 's family 's team wins every year ? 
It 's still gonna be fun , though . 
The only thing that would make it more special is if the third family member on our team was ... you , Father . 
What do you say ? 
I say the same thing I 've said dozens of times . No . 
I will be home with Ham and Judy and Moon doing our annual Hugs n ' Rugs . 
We clean the rugs , we give each other hugs , and the only loser is loneliness . 
Right , kids ? 
I 'd be your third , Wolf , but I 'm banned , just ' cause I used the tug-of-war rope improperly for an attempted strangulation in 1957 . 
Come on , Dad , I 'm begging you . 
With you on our side , we might even win ! 
You are great at tugging things , Dad . 
When our school bus broke down on that field trip , you tugged us all the way home . 
Plus , Beef , you could use a night out . 
Let 's get a little sloppy and have some fun . 
I put my sloppy days behind me when I became a dad at 19 . 
While Kathleen continued to live it up , I took care of diaper changes , feedings , and emotional stability . 
But to her credit , she would occasionally shout something supportive from an adjoining room . 
Okay , Beef , but I do think every parent deserves a big night out every now and then . 
Rest assured , Honeybee , I had enough big nights at that good old bar to last a lifetime . 
And after a few too many , if this wonderful song came on ... Ooh ! " The Humpty Hump " ? 
No , a sea shanty called " Three Sad Wives . " 
Once I heard that , all bets were off , and I 'd enter a state known as " the Dare Bear . " 
would always goad the Dare Bear to do 
Heck , one time , he offered me $ 700 to drink a shot of that old toe juice . 
But not even the Dare Bear would take that bet . 
- Just when I think my dad can 't get any radder . 
- Rad , indeed . 
the Dare Bear went into hibernation forever . 
- Sorry , you two , but the only thing this guy 's gonna be chugging tomorrow night are his parental responsibilities . 
In that case , we 'll go with our second most logical option ... Adopting my best bud Cheesecake as our child . 
I will not recognize Cheesecake , your adult best friend , as a family member . 
Wow ! That 's your grandchild ! 
Well , Dad , since I 'm gonna be swamped with adoption paperwork , could you at least drop off our $ 200 entry fee and entry form with Pamela Suggs ? And also loan us , $ 200 ? 
Judy , we 've been over this . 
I 'm not going to tape an iPad to my chest and live stream tomorrow night 's kegger in the woods for you . Me neither . Sorry , Ham , but iPads look too boxy on me . 
Well , we at least expect a photo every 15 minutes just to get us through Rugging n ' Hugging with our dad while every other teen in town is unsupervised and going wild . Hi . 
Wow . I didn 't even see you guys there . 
You literally just walked up to us . 
Hey , Judy , quick question . 
Is your dad gonna make you stay home and vacuum tomorrow night while the rest of us are in the woods being cool ? 
No . 
Well , I mean , factually , yes , but ... Yeah , I knew you were gonna say that because you 're just like a vacuum . 
Everyone in school thinks Ham and I are losers who never party . 
Honestly , guys , the kegger hasn 't been the same since Doug De Luca got emancipated and stopped coming . 
He was the real party captain . 
Now there 's never enough alcohol to go around . 
Doug De Luca was such a legend . 
I was at the party where he was so wasted , he drank a whole fish tank , including the little plastic treasure chest and all the fish . 
He pooped one out alive later ! 
And I heard , another time , he got one of those hot tub limos , and he did a cannonball into it and almost drowned . 
Well , I guess that kind of debauchery is something Judy and I were never meant to know . 
Makes me so mad , I 'm going to open my locker just so I can slam it . 
Four . 17 . 12 ? Nope , nope . 
Whoa . It 's the Dare Bear himself . 
I haven 't seen you around here in 20-odd years . 
And I do mean odd . 
I must say , Pamela , I love what you 've done with the place . 
- Absolutely nothing . 
- Ha ! How about a breakfast beer for old time 's sake ? 
Thanks , but they 're called old times for a reason . 
I 'm just here to drop off my son Wolf 's Chug n ' Tug entry form . 
Good . I hope he enjoys it , since it 'll be the last one . 
My cousin Burt-tholomew started gambling again , stole my savings , and now I 'm gonna ... lose the bar . 
What ? No . - The Toe in the Snow can 't close . 
- Yup . Looks like the Dare Bear 's old den ain 't long for this world . 
I 've missed three mortgage payments . So if you want to take home that chandelier you loved to swing on , then you better do it now . Because in a few days , it 'll be property of the bank . 
Exactly how deep underwater are you ? 
A little over six grand . 
You 're the only person I 've told . 
So embarrassing . 
You know the Suggs don 't like to ask for help . 
When Grandpappy cut his toe off , he put it in his pocket and walked three miles to the hospital . Then , when he got there , he just asked for a jar to put it in . 
This is tugging at my chug strings . 
Damn it . Pamela , I 'm gonna save this bar . 
It 's time for me to put your alcohol where my mouth is . 
Here comes the airplane . Open wide ! 
You 're really committing to this baby thing , Wolf ? 
This is actually how I always feed Cheesecake . 
None of my back teeth ever came in . 
Wolf , Honeybee , important breaking news . 
I have decided to Chug n ' Tug with you ! 
C-cake , I 'm sorry , but this means you 're no longer my son . 
It 's not the first time I 've heard that . 
Kids , I apologize for my sudden change of plans . 
I know how much you all look forward to Rugs n ' Hugs . - But we could reschedule . 
- Please , no . - No , thanks . 
- Never ! 
Okay , Team Tobin , we are gonna win this thing and give the money to Pamela to save the Toe in the Snow Tavern ! 
Hell yeah ! 
I 'm finally - gonna tug with my dad . 
- Babe , no ! 
Okay , so now that our dad has decided to finally act like a normal parent and get drunk , can you fill us in on how we should act at the kegger tonight ? 
My God , it 's the cast of Below Dork . 
Before you keep barfing out your words , Stacy , you should know that Judy and Ham are , in fact , going out tonight . 
Are they coming to study at the party ? And narc everybody out ? 
Actually , you know what ? We 're not even going to that kegger , Stacy . 
We 're doing something much cooler that you aren 't even invited to do . 
Ooh ! Am I invited , Judy ? 
Yes , Ham . 
What ? You 're so funny today . 
Remember how we are all going to do that thing that will make us party legends like Doug De Luca ? 
Because that is actually who we are partying with . - With Doug . 
- Judy . 
Nobody knows where Doug is . 
Ooh , then I guess we 're not nobodies ' cause we do know where he is . 
You 're totally lying . 
There 's no way that Dougie D. Would hang out with you scabies . 
Yes , there is a way , and we will send you the pics to prove it . 
- God . 
- So have fun at your boring kegger for dweebs , Stace . 
- Judy , what the hell ? 
! - Did you see her face ? 
My God , she was so mad . 
Um , we are also mad . 
We do not know where Doug De Luca is . 
Last I heard , he and Jared Leto were in Mykonos writing a Joker musical . 
Guys , don 't be so negative . 
If Dateline has taught us anything , it 's that anyone can be found . 
Farewell , children . 
I 've provided Aunt Dirt with the Tobin Babysitter Bible , so it should be a seamless transition in terms of policies and procedures . 
And as always , I 'll call to check in every hour on the hour , just like your mother 's old probation officer Jerrod . 
Look . There 's your ride . 
- Better get going . - Bye-bye now . Goodbye . 
There you go . Bye-bye . Not that we 're anxious for you to leave . 
We 'd love for you to stay , 
- so if you want to stay , just say the word . 
- Ham ! I-I mean , get out of here , Dad ! 
Now ! - Ham ! - I don 't know what 's going on here , but Londra 's waiting , so let 's go . 
Okay , guys , the coast is clear ! 
I see . Moon and I were planning to use the laundry basket to sled off the roof , but if you 've got something better cooking , we 'll take a flyer on it . 
- Well , if you must know ... 
- We must . We 're gonna find party legend Doug De Luca and then party with him legendarily . 
The only problem is , we have no idea where he is . 
Well , I knew a Chester De Luca in my day , and I 'm guessing he 's Doug 's grandfather , ' cause Chester was also a party legend . 
He made Cary Grant look like Jimmy Stewart , 
- if you know what I mean . - We do not . 
It 's not my fault you 're dumb . 
Now , Chester had an underground speakeasy . 
I bet Doug 's party is there . 
I still know the password . It 's showing your boobs . - Yeesh . - Relax , Polly Prudebottom . 
I 'm happy to show mine . 
They 're a little long , but they 're going strong . 
Judy , you might have to help me hold them up to the peephole . 
- Can do . I 'll make us all some Van-hattans in a travel flask . 
- Great . 
- Moon , you 're driving . 
- He 's ten . Come on , Ham , you know I can drive . 
- Yup . 
You 're the best driver in the family . 
Yeah . 
Okay , here we go . 
The Big Dance . Holy Hoobastank , Dad ! 
Someone carved " Don 't poke the Dare Bear " on this table . 
Yes , I had quite a following back in the day . 
So cool . 
Good evening , tuggers ! 
Good evening . 
We 've got last year 's champions , the Ptuggin ' Ptarmigan family , in the house . - 
- Yeah . - We eat boos for breakfast and wash ' em down with these . 
You like that ? You like that ? 
You 're going down , Ptarmigans ! 
We 're gonna murder each and every one of you ! 
- Babe . - Sorry , I-I got carried away . 
But first up , it 's the Tobin Family Tobler-ropes versus the Evanoff Evan-knots . Hey , Duane . Nice to see you . 
You 're all going down , too , FYI . 
Chug ! 
Dad , what 's wrong ? 
I don 't remember how to chug . 
Don 't think and don 't savor , just swallow . 
Finish it all in one gulp . 
And tug . 
On my honor ! 
Let 's keep our composure . We have many ropes to travel . 
I get it . What a perfect front for a speakeasy . 
- Classic . 
- It 's not a front , Ham . - The speakeasy 's gone . 
- And I may have a few outstanding warrants , and our designated driver 's a ten-year-old , so let 's not cool our heels here too long . 
Okay , but where are we supposed to go ? 
That was our only Doug lead . 
Well , I guess we could go talk to Chester . - Ask him where his grandson is . 
- Wait , Chester is alive ? 
Yeah , I ran into him last week . 
My dealer Morty lives at his retirement home . 
Wait , what kind of dealer ? 
Blackjack , butt crack . 
We 're not paying you to ask questions . 
- You 're not paying me . 
- Even better . Next up , the Tobin Family Tobler-ropes versus Alyson and her Sisterhood of the Tugging Pants . 
Does Alyson have two incredibly large , hot sisters ? 
Yeah . Madison and Wisconsin . 
They 're in town from Portland . They 're super nice . 
So large . 
Chug ... and tug ! 
I 'm a little distracted by those double dreamboats over there . 
The phrase " smother me " - keeps popping into my head . 
- Use it . Pull those giant Alysons into your arms , Dad . 
- Woo-hoo ! - Bring on the next beer . 
Gosh , I just realized I haven 't phoned the kids once yet . 
Don 't worry , Dad , I 'll text them for you . 
I have their numbers . We text all the time . 
Incredible . 
Hey , maybe we should do a few shots ? 
You sure about that , Dad ? 
I mean , what about focusing ? Come on , son , I may not be The Dare Bear , but you don 't want to be a Square Bear . 
- If you insist . 
- That 's the spirit , Mr. T. 
I pity the fool that doesn 't want to do shots with you . 
We 're down to the Final Four . 
It 's the Tobin Family Tobler-ropes versus the Tug-tleys . 
And chug ! 
Well , ex-squeeze me . 
I love drunk Beef . 
Give him another shot , Pam . 
Gladly . 
You still got it , Beef . 
Now get your asses on the rope . 
Okay , but wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait . 
Wait . I love you guys . 
Well , we love you , too , Dad , but we got to tug now . 
You got to tug now . 
Whee ... - Ooh , chandelier . 
- Plenty of time for that later , fella . 
Got to save the bar . 
- Chug ! - Gonna ... Dad , no . 
Don 't worry . I can pull from down here . 
I love you guys . 
Yes ! 
Shots for everybody , on me . Okay . Who wanted to see me ? 
You ? What are you doing here ? 
Morty 's in jail . 
They got him . I 'm not here for that . We 're looking for your grandson . 
These kids want to party . 
Last I heard , he was living on a houseboat at the marina . 
A party boat ? 
Hell yeah . You guys want a real party , stick around . 
The nurse fell asleep again . 
We got everything . 
I 'm gonna stick with these losers for now , but I 'll circle back for the after-party . 
Later , Chester . 
Don 't let my back door hit you on the way out . 
Maybe this is the boat that takes us to his party boat ? 
Or maybe this is a freaky party where the lights are all out and the first person to make a sound has to drink an entire bottle of Chardonnay . 
Bow-bow-bo-bow . Are you trying to do an air horn ? Yeah . 
Bam-bada-bam-berr ! Okay , that 's like a fanfare , that 's not even ... Kids , can we go inside ? 
Toot-toot , Doug . Party patrol . 
- Hello . 
- Doug . There he is . I mean , there you are . 
Lone Moose legend alert . 
Let 's party . 
Where do you keep your beer bongs , ' cause Mama came to rage . 
Sorry , we 've been looking for you all night . 
We 're here to become party legends at your awesome party , so let 's go . 
We just want to get in on whatever you 're doing tonight . Great . 
Come on in . 
Doug , um , would you eat a Meat-a-Roni ever ? 
What 's the savings ? - 35 cents . 
- Yeah . - That 's a keeper . 
- What about dog food ? 
Definitely . I call it " Doug Food . " 
So , how 's the emancipated life treating you , Doug ? Lot of freedom ? 
Lot of good times ? I 'm kind of too busy for good times . 
I work two jobs and my houseboat needs a new bilge pump . 
How 's things at school ? 
They still got classes ? 
Doug , do you have any alcohol ? 
I 'd really love to not feel this way anymore . No , alcohol is way too expensive for me now . 
But I have some friends just down the dock if you want to go visit them . That sounds like a party . 
Let 's go . Could I , use your bathroom first ? 
Sure . It 's that jar . 
- We can all turn around . 
- Never mind . I 'm never going to the bathroom again . 
And ... chug ! 
I can 't believe it took me this long to remember how much fun it is to have this much fun . 
That 's great , Dad . 
But what do you say we buckle down for a quick sec and get serious ? 
W-We 're in the finals against Craig and his fellow Ptarmigans . 
You 're going down , Tobin . 
You 're going down Tobin . 
I 'm gonna kick your ass , Beef . 
I don 't think you are , Beef . 
Or should I say 
Dare Bear ? 
Time to boogie , Beef . 
Dad , don 't listen . 
Put ... let 's put candles in his ears . 
And tug ! 
Dad , we need you on the rope . We got to save the bar . 
Beef , I 'm giving you ten seconds . 
- Beef ! 
- Dang it ! 
Three , two , one . 
And the Ptarmigans win . 
- This is bad . - I don 't know . He seems to be taking losing pretty well . 
I mean , sure , he 's , like , nine beers in and having the time of his life , but trust me , in the morning , he is gonna be hella pissed at himself . 
He 's never gonna let himself have fun again . 
- Dare Bare ! 
- Man . What 's he doing now ? 
- Dare Bear ! - You asked for it . 
Scroungey , 
Stubby , Two-legs . Daddy 's here . 
Come eat . - Now it 's a party . 
- Is it ? Sometimes I feed them like this . 
It helps build trust . 
- I wish I had teats . 
- Geez , I 'm just realizing what time it is , and that we simply must go because we are , um ... reverse-Draculas , which means that we 're allergic to the nighttime , so we have to go , - but let me just snap a quick pic real quick . 
- All right , cool . 
This is one of those times I never want to forget . 
Okay , everyone looks great , bye-bye . 
Hey , come back . 
I still have 45 minutes till my shift at the medical waste rendering depot . 
Let 's go home and clean those rugs , okay ? 
And I sure wouldn 't mind a hug . 
98 , 99 , 100 . 
I think he 's done enough dares for one night . 
Let 's try to get him home . 
We could be looking at a full Beef Melt when he sobers up and it really sinks in that he didn 't save the bar . 
But , hon , I got to say , I don 't think this is really ... - about the bar ? 
- What do you mean ? 
You guys might not be able to see it ' cause he 's your dad , but I think Beef actually wanted to cut loose tonight . 
The Chug n ' Tug was just , like , an excuse . 
He doesn 't care that much about this old bar except it 's the last time he was his old self . 
Gosh . Wow , yeah . 
So , what do we do ? 
Well , I think we save the bar and the Dare Bear . 
Maybe your dad doesn 't need to leave . Maybe he needs to stay here so we can poke the guy who loved to poke the Dare Bear . 
There he is . - He 's back , baby . 
- Sorry , Dad , we had to put you in the bathtub in case you puked . 
You asked to be put to sea , but this seemed safer . No . It 's coming back to me . 
The bar . I didn 't save it , did I ? 
And I-I danced . 
And sang ? - You want some coffee ? 
- Coffee will not remove the foul taste that comes from making a fool of myself . 
You want me to pistol-whip you ? 
That 's how we cured hangovers in the ' 50s . 
No , I 'll just lie here in my shame and regret , thank you . 
What shame and regret , Beef ? 
You did it . 
- Did what ? - You saved the bar . 
I mean , you didn 't , but the Dare Bear did . 
Wait , what ? What did that lunatic do ? 
That crazy little cub took a $ 6,000 dare from Craig Ptarmigan . No . Did we do a Cage-Travolta style Face / Off ? 
No , it was more of an In / Face . 
Chug , chug , chug ! 
Dear Lord . 
I didn 't . 
You did . You swallowed the toe . 
- Did I throw up ? 
- Nope . But I did . 
Might again right now just thinking about it . 
Then Craig gave you the cash , and you gave it to Pamela . 
She was incredibly grateful . But she would also like Pappy Suggs 's toe back when you 're , done with it ? 
Good lord . 
I mean , I 'm glad I saved the bar , but you guys must be very embarrassed of me . 
Hell no , Dad . 
It was great to see you having that much fun . 
Beef Tobin , Lone Moose party legend . 
Beep-beep-bop-berr . What sound are you making , Judy ? 
It 's the party air horn . 
- Bam-beep-bop-berr . 
- Sure . And everything worked out just like you wanted . 
So maybe you shouldn 't feel like you have to be in control all the time ? 
Yeah , I wouldn 't mind hanging out with the Dare Bear now and again . 
I got to admit , other than a pounding headache and the fact that I have an ancient man 's toe in my stomach , I had a wonderful night . 
By the way , how did we get home ? 
We picked you up on our way back from the docks . 
Great . 
Wait , why were you at the docks ? 
You just rest now , Father .
