- Hello ? 
- Beef cheeks , it 's carissa . 
Me and dorothy and marie are going to gals guzzle free night At the daiquiri cave in kenai . You wanna come ? 
Gonna be a lotta sturdy broads there ! 
I wish but ... My ... Nets are tangled , 
So gotta take a rain check . 
Beef , I love ya , but you 're a terrible liar . 
You should be meetin ' some bishes instead Of catchin ' fishes , but your loss . 
Smell you later . 
Time to unwind after a full day of fishing With a little more fishing . 
No . 
I 'll just swim back . 
God , the current . 
My leg is so stuck . 
Okay , think , beef . 
Your leg is stuck in the net . 
You gotta get untangled . But pulling is seeming to tighten the ropes . 
Cold water . 
Hypothermia . 
- Probably have 15 minutes at best . 
- Beef . 
- What ? 
- Relax . It 's all okay . 
God ? Is that you ? 
Sorry I said I thought you were imaginary . 
It 's not god , beef . 
It 's me ! Your penis . 
Man , hypothermia must be setting in . 
Wait , why do you have a southern accent ? 
' cause I 'm from down south . On your body . I mean ... 
I was , when I was alive . 
But now I 'm dead . And I 'm in heaven . 
Me . Your beautiful body handle . Deceased . 
That 's not true . 
What about last month ? 
The latest issue of fisherwoman 's quarterly . 
That was a few minutes of fun . 
I 'm not talking about catchin ' your own cod , I 'm talking about sex . 
Sex is kinda my thing . 
Well , I never have the opportunity to meet anyone . 
" I never have the opportunity ... " 
You pass up opportunities all the time . 
You just passed up an opportunity to go to Gals guzzle free night with carissa . 
I have ears , you know . 
- You do ? 
- Kinda . 
Anyway , saying no to going to a literal ladies night Was the last straw for me . 
It killed me . 
Just come join me in heaven . 
But I don 't want to die . 
Well , then , maybe I could help you . - Please ! 
- If you could also help me . 
- I 'll do anything . 
- Promise me you 'll actually start living , Get me in the game ? 
Because I 'm not asking for a lot ! 
I 'd take a-a one-night stand . Or , I don 't know , let 's say you meet a lady At the bus station . Y 'all go to the bathroom together . She gets you up on the changing table . 
Maybe that 's part of it . 
Wait , what am I saying ? 
Please , help me get untangled ! 
Okay , the net is tangled around your left foot . 
It 's in a kind of a cinch knot , so slide it up your leg To loosen it , then wiggle your foot out . 
Holy hell . 
I 'm alive . I 'm alive ! 
Sorry ... I 'm ... Late . 
Beef , you okay there ? 
You look like the bear from the revenant . 
What happened to you ? 
Okay , I know this might sound bonkers , But I had a near-death experience , And I ... 
The cherubic faces of your beloved children ? 
No , I saw my ... My penis in the sky , and it spoke unto me . 
So you passed out , had a dream ? 
This was no dream , it was an epiphany . 
My , genital member was angry About me not having ... - A falcon ? - Sex . 
And that 's my cue . 
Glad you 're okay , dad . 
I 'll be on the porch not talking about this . 
I 'm also suppressing a scream of terror At the prospect of discussing dad 's boudoir journey , But I like to be perceived as sex-positive , And I want dad to be happy , so I 'm just gonna stay here But just nod and say " ... - " I , on the other hand , am ready to dig in . 
Father , are you saying that your downstairs dad Wants you to get a girlfriend ? 
He 's not looking for commitment . 
He 's after a one-night stand . 
Maybe me and honeybee can find you a date , And then we can all go out together ! 
It 's always been a dream of mine To do some double-teaming with my dad . 
I hope to god that 's not what you meant to say . 
Thank you for the offer , son . But I 've gleaned from tv That if all I 'm looking for is a " hooking up , " I should just get on the ... 
Yeah , if you 're just after a little straddle-and-skedaddle , Then dating apps are just the ticket . 
All right , once we finish dinner , I will expose myself to the internet . 
Hey , moon . Did you have to fart during dinner 
So you came outside ? 
It happens to me all the time . 
Just last week I had to run out of steak ' n shake . 
Actually , the indoor conversation Got a little too grown-up for my liking . 
What are you up to , jerry ? 
I was just stopping by to grab My spare bigfoot head . I left it over here last week . 
- May I ? - Yeah . 
Whoa , baby bigfoot . 
Ooh , this is giving me an idea . 
My gigs have slowed down a little lately , And I could use a new gimmick . 
You want to play bigfoot 's baby brother At the birthday gig I 'm headed to ? 
- For real ? 
- Heck yeah , it 'll be fun . 
Plus , I always wanted a real-life baby brother , 
- So what do you say ? 
- I 'm in . 
And we can split the tip . 
Free money ? 
Okay , you 're already my new best big brother . 
Let me go inform my family about my new life . 
Okay , I uploaded the only picture we have of dad smiling . 
Remember ? We took it after You saw that monkey wearing human clothes . 
It 's not what they 're supposed to wear . 
So , I guess I just click this button ... 
- Hey , you matched . - Wonderful . 
What do I do ? 
Send her a letter in the mail ? 
You meet her tonight at the russian restaurant . And ... 
Send . If things go well , you 'll be getting 
An extra side of russian un-dressing . 
- I hope so . 
Life is precious , and I cannot squander this second chance . 
I must do what my trouser captain demands . 
Hello ... - Tracy ? 
- Hi . Hi . 
I 'm sex tobin . 
I 'm here for beef . 
I mean sex . 
I mean I 'm here for a date . Sex . Beef . 
- Sex me . 
- I 'm gonna go . 
Oof . Rough start , but that 's okay . We gotta get you back on that horse . 
That sex horse . Yee-haw , dad ! 
Here we go . 
I wonder if I 've ever eaten a fish that you caught . 
That sure is fun to think about . 
It is . 
I hope you 're enjoying your drink . - I am . - You 're welcome . 
- I don 't follow . 
- I invented cups . 
You invented cups ? 
- Yes . 
- Is this a joke ? 
Also , I know you 're ... Hillary clinton . 
I can 't wait to wriggle that skin suit off you - Back at my place . 
- To be expected . You 're gonna meet some people who are bonkers in the wonkers . 
Right . Back on the sex horse I sit again . 
Maybe I 'll get earplugs , Or perhaps the lord will take me . 
Here we go . This lady looks nice and normal . 
Nina ? 
Hello , daddy ! 
- My diaper was full . 
- No . 
No , no , no , no , no , no . 
Um , barbie ? 
I dwopped my pacifier , daddy . 
Guys , I 've been out every night this week . 
I 'm exhausted . 
And a new issue of fisherwoman 's quarterly arrived today , So maybe I 'll stay in and just read . 
Beef , that last app sucked , but I found one called lumber love that seems more your speed . 
You 're meeting a gal called dee tonight . 
She says she 's gonna be wearing head-to-toe plaid . 
Well , that is a great start . 
Hey , guys . I 'm here to pick moon up . 
Bigfoot and his little brother are a big hit . This is our fifth party this week . 
Let 's go do what bigfeet do . 
Stackin ' bills and delivering thrills . 
Well , there 's my date in head-to-toe plaid . Hey , delmer . 
I think there might have been a fun little mix-up . 
Hell no ! 
Sorry , mr . P , I really tried . 
Greta ? 
What are you doing on the ground ? 
It 's silly , I have something called " cottage cheese knees . " 
The dumb things just give out sometimes . 
I was just heading in for a drink . 
Are you leaving ? 
Buffalo wild wings . 
That was because of the sex . 
Good morning . 
Wow , beef . You sure made a lot of bacon . Which is great , because I 'm pork deficient . 
If I don 't eat at least a half a pound a day , My doctor says my hands could fall off . 
I know it 's just the two of us , but I set Six places out of habit . 
I love it ! I mean , Who doesn 't love breakfast ? 
Well , there was my old co-worker kedden Who used to scream at his hash browns In the break room , but he died . 
I also packed you a nutritious lunch . 
So , that 's there if you should want it . 
I ... Um , haven 't really , had , you know , A romantic encounter in a while . 
I wasn 't sure how to act . 
Beef , just because we knocked galoshes Doesn 't mean we have to act any differently . 
- We 're just friends who boned . 
- Friends who boned . Okay , I like the sound of that . 
Well , I have to go home And prepare this exact same meal For my entire family before they wake up . 
Surprise ! 
We noticed you didn 't come home last night , 
So we threw a little something together for you . 
Was it everything you 'd hoped for ? 
Rose petals ? 
Candles ? 
A single hershey 's kiss on your pillowcase ? 
- Spill . 
- Or , you know , don 't spill . At all . 
Son , those details are private . 
But what the heck ? 
Give me a slice of that one-night-stand cake . 
Why is there breakfast cake ? 
More like sex-fest cake ! Ha-ha ! 
- Dad went all the way ! 
- And back up I go . 
Take me with you . 
We did it , my penis . 
We had a one-night stand . 
Of sex ! 
Man , we 're making money hand over fist . 
And I 'm finally getting to experience The big brother thing . 
Who knew it 'd be so much fun Buying my little brother an amount of ice cream That would make him physically sick ? 
- You 're nailing it , jer . 
- Well , hello , hello , hello . Um ... Hello . 
We heard you 've been doin ' parties Around town , as a duo . 
Even heard you did ryan ferguson 's sixth birthday party . 
- Yeah . 
- Ferguson is our gig ! 
There 's only room for one Big / little party duo in this town . 
Used to be big cher and little cher . Then someone gave ' em a pair of concrete wigs . 
Now the only big / little duo is us . 
Okay , that was freaky . 
Don 't worry about it , little bro . 
They 're just party entertainers . 
Yeah , what 's the worst they could do ? 
Hit us with a bucket of confetti ? 
Or make us a delightful balloon animal ? 
Honestly , I 'd welcome it . 
Good morning , My fine family . 
What are you looking at ? 
- Hi , dad . 
- Morning . 
- Nothing . - Dad , If you 're thinking about reading 
The poetry corner , don 't bother . It 's just dumb . But today 's obituaries are popping off . 
Don 't be ridiculous , judy . 
You know poetry corner is always my first stop After I read the date . 
" October 14th . " pretty good . Hey ! 
Should we all go on a road trip ? 
Vegas ? 
- Let 's go ! 
- Not now , son . 
And I 'd thank you not to throw keys at my head . 
" red meat no gristle , " late night guided missile . By ... 
" when he helped me up in the parking lot , " suddenly things got very hot . 
" in the darkness entwined , on each other , we dined . 
" I was disrobing , He was ... Beef tobin . " 
My god . 
" bedclothes askew ; aroma , beef stew . 
" night gives way to dawn , And yet our lovemaking goes on . " 
Very cool ! 
I wanted a discreet one-night stand , Not to be the star of a literary sex tape . 
Dad , you got to celebrate your accomplishments . 
This poem is going right up on the fridge . 
I listened to my sky member , And now I 'm the town trollop . 
Dad , relax . 
I don 't think anyone is gonna care much about this . 
When crispin and I started dating We thought we 'd be the talk of the town . 
You know , being a new couple in a small alaskan village , But people moved on pretty quickly . 
Frankly , a little more quickly Than my ego was comfortable with . 
And , beef , I didn 't even know There was a poetry corner in the lone moose wind . 
I bet no one 's even read this . 
You 're probably right . 
I mean , kids today , with their video games And their linkedins , and their ... Kites . 
I 'm sure nobody cares about my sex-capades . 
I 'm just gonna go run my errands and , Not give it a second thought . 
Dad ? You okay ? 
You 're sitting on your brooding log . 
I was in town , and it seems like many other ladies Wanted me to dip my ... Beef taquito in their ... Lady queso . 
Which I know a lot of guys would dig , But being the center of attention Just isn 't my style . 
Dad , if you don 't like all the attention , You should go talk to greta . She should know that you 'd rather keep Any further rhyming couplets about your romp private . 
All right , hamjam . 
When did you become so wise ? 
About three years ago . 
Pretty crazy that we 've done Three parties for this family in one week . 
Yeah , they always give little jay-jay three parties . 
He 's gonna grow up to be a monster . 
Hey , what in the ... I think those damn clowns pied your car . 
Honk-honk , bitch . 
How 'd you get in here ? 
You just couldn 't leave well enough alone , could you ? 
Since you boys can 't take a hint , Costume battle . Woods . Tomorrow night . You . Us . Couple other guys . 
Appetizers , but not a meal . 
You get the picture . 
What the hell 's a costume battle ? 
It 's how us local party entertainers settle This kind of score . 
Winner gets to keep their act . Loser loses theirs . 
Boy , these clowns make the one from it seem chill . 
I hope no one was watching them leave . 
Be real disappointing to see Only two clowns get out of a car . 
Hello , greta . 
I read your poem . 
You did ? I 'm so glad . 
I was so stirred by our lovemaking That I was finally able to rhyme . 
Would you like to come in ? 
I ... Yes , beef ? 
Yes ... so ... 
Based on this second , very graphic poem , I 'm guessing you didn 't tell greta That you didn 't love the first one ? 
Well , I tried , but ... 
Let me guess , you made significant eye contact And then just boned again . 
- We did . 
- Hoo ... " more beef broth overfloweth my trough , By greta meatweep . " 
It 's a great title for the sequel . Wait . Let me just ... Brace myself . Okay . 
Proceed . " prime rib sandwich , open face . Mid-day gravy , hot embrace . " 
no ! No ! Nope , nope , nope ! Sorry , I tried to be cool , but I am not this cool . 
Good luck , dad . And I am going to go upstairs to my room And then out the window to a therapist ! 
And I shall go to my room . 
For the foreseeable future , I shall moor my personal watercraft In the safe harbor of my own underpants . 
Hey , judy , you want to bring the table piece back ? 
I could get started fixing it . 
This seems kind of bad . 
And I think you 'll share my concern ... - Where are the frickin ' appetizers ? 
- There 's noodie the noodle . 
Looks like he 's been hitting the sauce pretty hard . 
- Didn 't think you 'd show up . 
- Yeah , we showed up . 
And you messed up by messing with My big bigfoot bro ! 
Go on , jerry . Get ' em ! 
Moon ! No , no , no , no . Don 't say that . - I-I 'm not ... 
- All right . Here 's how this goes down . 
First we strip down to our underwear So we don 't stain our costumes with blood . 
Then we fist-fight . Then winners burn the losers ' costumes . 
But first , everybody gets ten minutes To do whatever drugs they want . 
Moon , look . I think I 've been so focused on being a fun brother That I forgot about the other big brother stuff , Like protecting you . 
I mean , taking you to a clearing in the woods With a bunch of psychopaths ? 
That 's not ideal big brother behavior . 
I think it might be time to retire our bigfoot team . 
But maybe we could just hang out sometimes . 
Definitely . 
Okay . When I say , " run , " run . 
- Run ! 
- Hey ! Get back here . 
Where are you going ? 
I 'll miss you ... ! 
Okay ... Yeah , this is bad . 
Very , very bad . Morning , my sibs . Your plates are saying flapjacks , But your faces are saying , " crap . " 
" my eager vegan by greta meatweep " ? 
" your long blonde rattail glistening in the sun . 
Your lips like silken tofu , your patchouli-soaked man bun . " 
This poem is not about your dad . 
" truffle hunting at night , my garden delight . 
I unearthed his carrot , and with glee he did share it . " 
I know this poem 's not about dad , But I still hate it . 
Looks like greta took a veggie dip . 
Dad 's gonna be devastated . 
He 's just gotten himself Back on the market , and now he 's being recalled . 
- Gee ! 
Hi-hi , hi . 
- Hi . Hi , dad . 
What , What 's going on ? 
Th-th-the ... Whole yard is-is on fire , So ... 
You better ... 
I see . 
Excuse me . 
- No , greta broke his heart . 
- I 'll go after him . 
- Wolf , no . 
- But he 's ... 
Sad . Yes , wolf , probably . 
But look , dad chose to sleep with somebody . Twice . And it got complicated . 
But as someone who has had to think about This kind of relationship and sex crap From the time he was ... 12 And first saw a knight rider rerun ... Hasselhoff . 
Vroom-vroom , baby . 
Exactly . 
And that car was no slouch , either . 
Look , as a gay dude , I always knew that My love life might bring me a bit of , Scrutiny . But the other choice , hiding away , kind of sucks . And we got to let dad process that . Even if it means he lives in the shed for a month or two , 
Mumbling and eating cold spaghetti . Okay , then , batten down the hatches . It 's about to get very forlorn around here . 
Come on , penis , show yourself . 
We need to talk . 
Maybe I have to be at risk of death . 
No ! I 'm in danger . 
I could die . 
Beef ! My man ! What is up ? 
I am really proud of you . 
You 're the conductor of the bone town express . 
Choo-choo ! No . I am not that . 
Although I do like trains . But I 'm upset . 
Is it because greta took another lover ? The vegan ? 
How do you know that ? 
Beef , I 'm a part of you . 
I know everything you do . 
I know you 're about to fart right now . 
Well , you 're wro ... see ? 
So , what 's the big deal about greta ? You jealous ? 
No . And that 's what I 'm upset about . 
I was always kind of jealous of kathleen , So why am I not devastated That I 'm not greta 's only boy toy ? 
Has having casual sex turned me into some kind of a lothario ? 
Beef , if you want answers , You need to talk to the guy who sent me . 
No offense to me , but I am pretty dumb . 
Someone sent you ? 
Your heart sent me . 
- Hey , heart . - Hey , fellas . 
I was just thinking about this cat I saw once That only had three paws . 
He rode around on a little scooter . - He was so brave . 
- ' sup , dennis . 
My heart 's name is dennis ? 
- Your name is beef ? 
- Fair . 
Beef , it 's not just your down-below dangler That 's been dead for years . 
It 's me , too . 
What ? I use you all the time . 
I-I love the kids . And the boat . And that cat with the three paws . 
I remember when we saw jangles on that website . 
Beef , I 'm talking about romantic love . 
I haven 't gotten to feel that in years . 
Okay , but then why 'd you send my wiener ? 
Come on , beef , we all know the saying , " the penis is the gateway to the heart . " 
That 's not a saying . Sure it is . I have it on a bumper sticker . 
You have a car ? 
Sort of . 
Well , it 's complicated . 
Look , beef , the point is , if you don 't start Getting your old rod and reel back in the game , Then I have no chance , either . 
And we 've got a lot of good years ahead of us . 
So you 're saying that if I keep - Doing the deed ... 
- Hell yeah ! 
You can handle that , dennis ? 
I mean , you were really messed up Back when you-know-who ran off . 
Yeah . I was a disaster . 
Remember how we used to have to lie down in the shower Every time an air supply song came on ? 
We were both hanging on by our fingertips . 
But I 'm better now . 
I guess that 's true . 
These days , when I hear air supply , I just turn the radio off And sometimes rub a cool rag across my forehead . 
We 're just asking you not to fish your whole life away While your friends go to gals guzzle free night . 
Okay , I 'll do what you guys want and get out there again . 
Yes ! But , beef , it 's actually what you want . 
' cause we 're you , ding-dong . 
Hey , since we 're gonna be getting back out there again , Maybe we call that doll lady ? 
No . - absolutely not . But I will keep trying . 
I promise . All right , well , we 'll be seeing you around , beef . 
Bye , player . 
Don 't be afraid to reach out . 
Wait , my penis . I never got your name . 
It 's cindy ... 
Thanks for all the support through the years , Captain christy covington , Beast of bass fishing and three-time cover girl . 
But I got this now . 
You know what ? A man can change his mind .
