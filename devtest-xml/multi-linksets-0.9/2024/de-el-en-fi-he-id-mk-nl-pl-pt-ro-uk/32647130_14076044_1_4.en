I 'm - - I 'm looking for Darius . 
No . You 're not . 
You are not looking for Darius . You are looking for answers . 
Actually , what I 'm looking for are the humans . 
Humans ? 
You won 't find them in my presence . 
Right . I just - - 
Do you know where they are ? Where I could find them ? 
Silence . 
All your questions must be in the past tense because all of my answers have already happened . 
Yeah . I don 't understand . 
Not " Where am I going ? " but " Where did I come from ? " 
Not " Who will I meet when I die ? " but " Who died before I could meet them ? " 
Not a question about something you want to know . A question about something you never knew . 
I wanna know what happened to this planet before it was Orbona . 
What happened to the humans ? 
A particularly painful request . 
Very well . Gifts given for given gifts . 
Gifts given . 
A gift . 
Okay . 
I 'm not sure I have anything you want . 
But you do have something I want . 
Let 's see . Let 's see . 
I know there 's a spare one here somewhere . 
Yes . 
I believe this one . 
Oh , my . 
When was this one fill - - What a moment , that . 
So beautiful . 
Is there anything more joyful than the birth of one 's child ? 
My apologies . 
I thought that one was empty . 
Just a moment . 
Much better . 
These are all filled with memories ? 
Joyful memories . Now mine to experience whenever I choose , whenever I need . 
And you want one of my memories . 
A most happy memory . 
Okay . Close your eyes . 
Grip the handles tightly . 
And remember . Let the memory find you . Take you back to a time when you had no cares or worries . 
A time when you felt love . Safe . 
Happy sixth birthday , Eva . 
Make a wish . 
When you knew exactly what you wanted . 
Dyna-Chamber unlocked . 
Many children just like you are being raised in underground sanctuaries just like this one . 
When do I get to play with them ? 
And once you pass the Final Assessment test , you can go through the big door . Where you 'll get to meet your family . 
And you believed that everything was right in the world . 
What is this ? 
Gift given . 
Given gift . 
I arrived on Orbona with my brothers and sister by the grace of King Ojo . 
He perceived the planet to be an open plane , ripe with potential for life . 
But I perceived a broken world and the aura of catastrophe . 
All I could hear were the screams of those who had fallen before me . 
All I could feel was the pain of a desecrated world . 
All I could see was death . 
And I was haunted by the humans . 
Who were they ? 
Who did this ? 
The ones you sought , who destroyed it all and buried themselves with it . 
No . 
No ! This is not why I came here . 
I do not expect all to appreciate my gifts , but please know yours means a great deal to me . 
The pain of the past is , at times , too much to bear . 
Up here , with my memories , I feel only happiness . 
Make a wish . 
Many children just like youâ  ¦ 
- Many children just like you . - â  ¦ in sanctuariesâ  ¦ Sanctuaries just like this one . 
Oh , no . 
No . It can 't be . 
Wait , but - - I can explain . 
Humans underground this whole time ? 
That there should be even one more would be too many . 
Get out . Underground monster . 
- Burrowing demon . Ghost of the dirt . 
- Wait , please . 
Get out ! 
Drowning imminent . 
Eva , please respond . 
Eva , please respond . 
Thanks , Otto . 
That was close . 
You 're okay now . 
And I didn 't eat any yummy fish . 
Probably . 
Darius , she - - No . 
She has to be wrong . 
Don 't be sad . 
She called me a monster , Otto . Just because I 'mâ  ¦ human . 
We were supposed to be the ones to rebuild the planet , but she said we destroyed it . An - - 
What if I 'm alone ? 
What if I 'm the only one ? 
Oh , Eva . You 're not alone . 
- All right . Fill the gourd . - Rovee ? 
Okay . 
- I give you whatever you want . - Yes ! You know what to do . 
You 're right , Otto . I 'm not alone . 
The patch . It belonged to another human . 
Another sanctuary-born . I have to find out where it came from . 
Not now , not now , not now . When . 
Can 't believe I walked right into this mess . 
- What was I thinking ? - Yeah . Thinking is overrated . 
- Well , I wasn 't thinking , was I ? 
- Absolutely not . 
What ? You don 't think I 'm a smart guy ? 
- Smart as they come . 
- Then why am I so stupid ? 
Maybe the smarts come and went . 
Come here . Come here . 
- You wanna know a little secret ? 
- I already know the one about winning . 
No , no . Better . 
She is a human . 
Okay . 
Someone had a little too much to drink . 
I see that look on your face . You don 't believe me . 
Buddy , no one have seen any human for a long time . 
Time to close the bar . 
It is getting late . 
However , you still drinking , and I have nowhere to go . 
Rovee , what are you doing ? 
Don 't call me Rovee . 
Hand it over . 
There . Go away . 
They 're half gone ? 
I got my half . You got yours . 
You know I need this money . All of it ! To find out where Caruncle got that Dynastes patch . 
Caruncle 's a crook and a liar ! 
- Am I wrong ? - Never trust a guy in a sweater-pants . 
But that patch came from somewhere , right ? 
Everything come from somewhere . 
Like Uncle Boodoo Obeedo always said , 
" To get anywhere , you have to start somewhere ! " 
- Or was it " Put on your underwearâ  ¦ " 
- Where are you going ? - We had a deal . 
- And you broke it . So I took my share out of the winning . 
- Simple . - So , that 's it ? - We 're done , just like that ? 
- Just like that . Please , I need your help . 
You are the only one who can get me where I need to go . 
Why ? 
Why me ? I 'm not the one you need ! 
You got me here ! And you - - I got you here for the money . The deal . Nothing more . That 's it . I am a washed-up old drifter , end of story . 
I can 't help you ! 
Fiscian said you 're the greatest pathfinder on Orbona . 
Fiscian 's got a big mouth . 
And Hostia told me about what happened - to your family . - About nothing . 
You don 't know anything about me . 
So stop talking . Stop following me . 
- Go away ! 
- I 'm s - - Oh , the jargum 's not working anymore ? 
Human brain too slow ? 
We are done . Deal over . 
Goodbye . 
How can Caruncle help you ? 
Perhaps a numerical boredom tracker ? 
Or a device used to plant one seed at a time ? 
I 'm here about the patch you sold to Rovender Kitt . It had a Dynastes Corporation logo on it . 
Right . Yes . The Dynastes logo , huh ? 
- You have the 300 shellacks ? - No , I don 't . 
- But what can I get for 150 ? 
- Wait a second . Half the money gets you half the information . 
- I just need to know where you got it . 
- That 's the half you cannot afford . 
What if I tell you what all the human stuff in here really is ? 
You make me laugh . Ridiculous . Caruncle is the premier expert on human merchandise . 
More of an expert than an actual human ? 
Wha - - Hey ! Welcome , welcome . A most unique guest . 
Please forgive Caruncle 's rudeness . 
Perhaps an exchange of information can be arranged . 
Great . I 'll start . The patch , where did you get it ? 
Caruncle received that patch in Solas as part of a trade . 
What 's Solas ? Uh-uh . My turn now . Any other humans with you ? 
I 'm alone . And I 'm trying to find the others . 
So , I need to know , what is Solas ? 
Solas is the capital city of Orbona , home to the single greatest collector of the Dynastes dynasty , Zin . 
In fact , Caruncle sold him one of these things in your hand . 
You mean this ? 
Another Omni . It could have names , dates , last known locations . 
I have to get it . 
Zin , he 's in Solas ? 
How do I get to Solas ? 
What do you mean ? By yourself ? No , it 's very far . 
You 're gonna need supplies , transportation and a map . 
Uh-huh . Caruncle happens to have one right here . 
Now let me see , I put it over - - Okay . 
Yeah . Right . Here it is . 
Come , come . Have a look . Caruncle wants to help . 
Always helping . 
What ? 
One of Besteel 's traps ? 
With the trap activated , he will arrive shortly . 
And you will soon learn about Solas , little human . 
Because you 're headed there as cargo . 
Uh-uh . When Caruncle was there yesterday , he heard of a human that had escaped Besteel 's grasp . 
And Zin was very disappointed in Besteel for losing you . 
You were to be the pride of his collection . 
And now you will be . 
It 's Besteel . 
He came much quicker than I thought . 
Besteel ! 
Over here ! 
The human 's this way . 
Be sure to remind Zin who was responsible for capturing the human . 
- Me . 
- You . 
Yes , of course you . 
Caruncle was merely the guy-between . 
Stop shooting at Caruncle 's shop . 
Do you know how much this cost me ? 
Stop , please . 
Are you kidding me ? 
You 're ruining my life . 
Caruncle still gets his money , yes ? 
- Muthr ! Muthr , we need to go . - Eva ! 
Where were you ? I have been very concerned . 
- Besteel , he found me . 
- Besteel ? He 's here . We need to leave , okay ? We 're going to Solas . Solas ? What is Solas ? Is everything all right ? 
Yeah , and where 'd you go ? 
Besteel found Eva . 
- Besteel ? 
That is not good . - No . He scares me . 
No , no . It 's okay . He doesn 't know I 'm here . Okay ? Muthr , I went and saw Darius . 
- You saw Darius ? 
- Did she ask to see your toes ? 
Eva , what have you been doing ? 
Maegdan , Zoozi , I need your help in the kitchen . 
- You don 't need our help . - Muthr , listen . Darius told me humans destroyed the planet . That they 're all gone . But that can 't be right . 
Where are all the other sanctuary-borns ? 
I should never have deviated from protocol . We should not have left Sanctuary . 
Muthr , Caruncle sold an Omnipod to someone in Solas . Someone named Zin . 
That could tell me where they are . So we have to go there , now . 
- You are sure Besteel didn 't follow you ? 
- I 'm sure . Then perhaps staying here is the safest option . Here ? No , we are not staying here . 
An Omnipod . 
In Solas . 
First the patch , now the Omni , and this . 
Look , I found this in Sanctuary . 
" Eva find me . " 
I mean , someone is looking for me . 
We have to go to Solas . 
Enough ! We are not going to Solas . 
Don 't you want me to find my family ? 
- My first priority is to keep you safe . 
- I don 't need you to keep me safe anymore . 
Your selfish behavior would indicate otherwise . 
My selfish behavior ? 
Betting me . 
Sneaking out . 
You are being reckless and it 's going to get you hurt . 
We are staying here . 
No ! I am not staying here . Someone out there wants me to find them and you 're not going to stop me . 
As a MUTHR unit , my protocol is to help you , to keep you safe . 
Exactly ! You are a multi-utility task helper robot . You are not my real mother . 
- Eva ! Eva ! - And I don 't need your help . 
I know the human was here . 
- Where did it go ? - Human ? I didn 't know it was a human . 
I give you anything you want . 
How about a nice drink on the house ? 
- Be quiet . Shut up . - You don 't have to go . 
- You can drink it right here . 
- You talk too much . Besteel . 
Well , look at here . 
I heard you wanna take me to Solas . 
So , here I am . 
Well , well , well . 
Hello , human . 
Something so fragile should not be so bold . 
Perhaps that is why you 're the last of your kind .
