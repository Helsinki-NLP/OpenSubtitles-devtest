Greetings , Eva . 
I am a Dynastes Corporation Omnipod . 
But you can call me Omni . Ask me anything . 
Go ahead . 
Eva ? 
Open door . 
Surface . 
Friend . 
Can you repeat that ? 
Can you open the door so I can play with the other kids ? 
You cannot exit Sanctuary 573 until you pass the Final Assessment test . 
A test ? 
Can I take it now ? 
You seem very excited to take a test . 
That means it 's time for you to meet someone . 
I get to meet a person ? 
Go ahead . 
Dyna-Chamber unlocked . 
Welcome , Eva . 
Begin welcome instruction . 
Initiate welcome . 
Hello , Eva . 
My name is Cadmus Pryde . 
A human ! 
Well , technically , I 'm a hologram of Cadmus Pryde . 
And I hear today is a very special day . 
- I am six years old . 
- Six years old ? 
And I 'll bet you 're very excited about going outside to play with friends . 
Yes . 
Can I go now ? 
Not quite yet . 
And I 'll tell you why . 
You see , I helped make this underground sanctuary you 're living in right now . 
Why am I in the underground ? 
Well , it wasn 't safe for people to live up there on the surface anymore . 
The earth was very sick , and it needed time to get better without us . 
But that was a long , long time ago . And now the earth is feeling much better . 
Lots of children just like you are being raised in underground sanctuaries like this one and are up on the surface waiting for you . 
They are ? 
Are you ready to meet your family ? Yes ! 
Then you have lots to learn to get ready to go . 
I can count to 200 . 
And that 's a very good start , Eva . But there 's so much more . 
And that 's why Meego and his friends are here to help you prepare for the test . 
Hello , Mr. Cadmus . 
Hello , Eva . 
Meego ! 
Hi there , Meego . 
Isn 't it a beautiful day ? 
It sure is , Meego . 
Why don 't you tell us all about what Eva is going to learn ? 
Sure thing , Mr. Cadmus . 
Come on , friends . 
Agriculture , to grow the food you eat Health , to keep you on your feet Technology , the future you invent Science , now let 's experiment 
Communication , listen and talk with me Art , your creativity And teamwork , we do it all together ' Cause Meego and buddies your friends forever 
That was great , Meego . 
Thanks . 
So , train hard . 
And once you pass the Final Assessment test , you can go through the big door . 
And , Eva , you 'll make your way all the way up , up , up the stairs and onto the earth 's surface . 
Hi , Eva ! 
Over here ! 
Where you 'll get to meet your family . 
What 's it like on the surface ? 
How many kids are there ? Will they look like me ? 
- Do you think they 'll like me ? - Eva . - What 's the test like ? Is it hard ? - Eva . Is the training hard ? 
Is Meego gonna help me ? 
- Are you going to help me ? 
- Yes , of course . I like Cadmus . 
Will I meet him on the surface ? Does he have a family ? 
Eva , it 's time to go to sleep . 
Tomorrow 's a big day . 
You start your training . 
And you need your rest . 
Muthr ? 
Yes , dear ? 
Are we a family ? 
No , we are not . 
A family is a group of humans . The ones you will meet on the surface . 
Okay . 
Good night , Eva dear . 
I can 't wait to meet my family . 
Happy birthday , Eva . 
The time has gone so fast . 
Your 16th birthday . 
Would you like a big piece of cake ? Thank you . But - - It looks good - 
- No , no , can 't eat . I gotta get ready . 
You seem anxious . 
Are you feeling anxious ? 
- Omnipod , status . - Increased heart rate . 
- Sweaty palms . - We 've talked about this ! Don 't check my stats without asking . 
Perhaps we should reschedule tomorrow 's test . 
- Muthr . 
- Omni , reschedule tomorrow 's test . 
- Reschedule testing . - No . No rescheduling . 
- Omni , we 're not rescheduling . 
- Please make up your mind . 
Muthr . I 'm not anxious , okay ? 
I 'm excited . 
I 've been waiting a long time for this . 
I am finally going to meet friends , family , other humans . 
I gotta get ready . 
Hi , fellow human . 
I 'm Eva from Sanctuary 573 . 
What are you doing ? Human things ? 
Yeah . 
I like that . 
I also like doing human things . 
You hang out on the surface too ? 
How about that sun ? 
So bright , and you 're not supposed to look at it , but you totally want to , right ? 
Sanctuary , so over it . 
And Muthr , it 's like , seriously , my stats are private . 
If I have to eat one more kale-chickpea Susti-bar - - That 's your favorite ? 
Mine too . 
Yeah , I know . 
It 's just , I don 't know how to do this , how people are supposed to act , how to be normal . 
But we got this , right ? 
We got this . 
But what if we don 't ? 
Omni , what happens if I don 't pass the test ? 
I 'm sure you won 't fail . 
But if you do , protocol states to review your training from the beginning . 
From the beginning ? 
But I 'd get to take the test again , right , Omni ? 
Of course you would . 
On your following birthday . 
A year ? A year ? 
I can 't wait another year ! 
I need to meet people ! Now ! 
Omni , what 's on the other side of this ? 
I 'm sorry , Eva . I don 't have information on restricted areas . 
Restricted ? 
Omni , how can I open this door ? 
You can 't . 
Security doors are magnetically secured . 
Eva , tampering with security doors is forbidden . 
- Not for me . 
- This is like the time when you broke in - - Door is open . 
Omni , light level three . 
Sofia ? 
Brighton , Hadley , Freya , Roshon ? 
Eva . 
There are other kids ? 
There are other kids . 
I 'm not alone . I 'm not alone . 
Hello , where are you ? 
Hello , is there anyone here ? 
Brighton ? 
Hadley ? 
Roshon ? 
Sofia ? 
Please , where are you ? 
Omni , light level one . 
" Wondla . " 
What 's Wondla , Omni ? 
There is no " Wondla " in any of my encyclopedic files . 
- Is it a place ? 
- I 'm sorry . I cannot find Wondla on any of my Earth maps . 
" Eva , find me . " Wait , is someone looking for me ? 
Omni , light level 10 ! 
Okay , okay . Come on . 
Come on . Omni , activate visual signal . 
Come on , come on . Over here . 
I 'm here ! I 'm here ! 
It 's Eva !

I 'm here . 
I 'm right here . 
- Eva ? 
- Muthr ? 
- You entered a restricted area ? - I know . 
I 'm sorry , but I found something . 
I think there were other kids . 
I can explain . 
Eva , what 's going on ? 
There 's something else in there . 
Seal room 1-13 . 
We got this . 
Intruder in Sanctuary . 
Activate security protocol 19-1-65 . Standby . 
Security protocol activated . 
Target and fire . 
Vault lock override . 
Administration code 49-26269 . 
Pressurizing exit shaft . 
Vault door release activated . 
Eva , run ! 
It 's blocked ! 
Get to the kitchen ! 
Run ! 
- Lock code , 119-20-38-514 . 
- Securing room three . 
- What is that thing ? 
- I do not know . 
It is not in my database . 
Muthr ! 
This vent shaft leads to the surface . 
These supplies should be sufficient until you find other humans . 
From the other sanctuaries ? 
In each sanctuary there are supposed to be six children . 
You are the only one who grew up by yourself . 
I did not tell you . I had to make a choice . 
What ? 
What are you talking about ? 
Come with me ! 
I cannot leave Sanctuary . 
Please , Muthr , that thing will kill you . 
I was programmed to keep you safe . This is what I 'm doing . 
Trust what you have been taught . Go ! 
Oxygen levels stable . 
No airborne toxins . 
Breathe normally , Eva . 
Where am I ?
