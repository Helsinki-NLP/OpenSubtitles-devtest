What is it , exactly , to lead ? 
It is one thing to make bold plans and speak of victory to your men , but to fill their hearts with a fire so they willingly die for you ? 
As a wise man once said , 
" I do not fear an army of lions led by a sheep . " 
" I fear an army of sheep led by a lion . " 
Help me understand it , my king . 
Our numbers are unbeatable . 
- If we were to attack ... 
- Stop , Bessus . 
Just look . 
Breathe it in . 
That reckless boy king would have to take pause at such a glorious sight . 
But " unbeatable , " Bessus ? 
A man of your experience using that word . 
I think we have the numerical advantage . 
We had that at Granicus too . 
And you , Mazaeus . 
You think our hammer can crack this nut ? 
I think under these circumstances ... 
You can drop the diplomacy , Mazaeus . 
Our enemy has shown we cannot rely on brute force . 
Our enemy is riding his luck . 
Which is why we need to take the fight to him on our terms . 
We will isolate this bastard and get rid of him . 
Once and for all . 
But the wise man also knows that if you seek victory above all else ... you need an army of lions 
led by the biggest lion of all . 
Bad news ? 
We 're facing the largest army on Earth led by Darius . 
For Darius , the defeat at Granicus makes it clear that this is a serious problem . 
Even more so as he sees Alexander going down , sort of , the Levant towards Egypt , that he 's coming to do some serious damage to the empire . 
So he then gathers an imperial army to confront Alexander on that Levantine coast at Issus . 
Darius is determined to stop him in his tracks right there . 
Sir . 
The Persians are retaking Issus . 
Of course they are . 
That will sever our supply lines , reinforcements , communications . 
Not to mention where our wounded are being treated . 
Alex . 
We 'll be completely cut off . 
You asked for a stand-up fight . 
Well , it 'll happen there . But I 'm not sure you 'll want it . 
Alexander , you need to hear this for yourself . 
You have to imagine Alexander and Darius are moving through mountains . 
They don 't have a drone they can send to try and see where their opponents are , so they 're relying on reports and strategy and anticipating what their opponents might do . 
Ptol , that 's enough . 
A patrol caught him in the Beilan Pass , spying on our lines . 
Turns out he knows a lot about the Persian troop numbers too with the right prompting . 
Don 't you ? Huh ? 
Darius has called in reinforcements , the city garrison of Babylon , along with several thousand local conscripts . 
It gives them a standing army of ... 100,000 men . 
Versus our 40,000 . 
Look , Alex . We need to at least consider a retreat . 
Or it 'll be the kind of massacre only the Androctasiae can dream of . 
What ? 
Do you not know any mythology ? 
He means the spirits of slaughter , Ptol . 
But I disagree . 
Darius is running this by the book . Meaning ? 
I 've read it . 
It 's a well-worn Persian tactic . 
He 'll trap us here ... between the Amanus Mountains and the sea , then use their superior numbers ... to crush us . 
Those same mountains and sea prevent him from outflanking us . 
Meaning he can 't bring his entire force to bear on us all at once . 
Parmenion , can you hold their horses ? 
For how long ? 
Get me enough time to drive at them and they 'll fold . I know it . 
There 's no small risk to this strategy . 
But also no small merit . 
I 'll do my duty on the field . 
Then let 's take the battle to them . 
It 's clear from the outset that Darius doesn 't expect this to be a minor confrontation or a stepping stone to a larger battle . 
He wants this to be decisive . 
He wants to deal with the issue and get Alexander out of the way , so he 's kind of throwing everything he has at this battle . 
Macedonians . Already , danger has threatened you . 
And you ... You have looked it triumphantly in the face . 
But this time , the struggle will be between a victorious army and an enemy already once vanquished . 
And don 't forget . 
They are Persians . 
Men who , for centuries , have lived soft and luxurious lives . 
While , for generations past , we of Macedon have been trained in warfare . 
There is a stain ... upon your houses . 
An infestation led by a degenerate king with one aim . 
To sully all that is good and pure about Persia . 
My question to you . Will you let him ? 
No ! Will you stand by and watch him take your homes , your livelihoods ? 
No ! Let their filthy Greek hands molest your wives ? 
Then I say fight ! 
Not for me , not for Persia , but for yourselves ! 
When Darius travels , he takes the whole of the court with him . 
Persia ! Queen Stateira , Barsine , his daughter , were all present themselves . 
It was an absolute standard royal Persian practice to bring the women close to the battlefield . 
That suggests to me that Darius thinks the outcome of this is already secured , that his wife and his family are going to see the spectacle of the king slaughtering his enemies . 
Yeah ! Hopefully , as far as Darius is concerned , he 'll put an end to this mess once and for all . 
But , above all , remember this . 
We are free men , and they are mercenaries fighting for Darius , fighting for pay . 
But we ... Brothers , we will be fighting for Macedon , and our hearts will be in it . 
Yes ! 
Come on ! 
The interesting thing here for Alexander is that he only has to lose one battle and that 's it . 
If he loses that battle , you can be pretty sure that Darius isn 't going to be magnanimous , because he sees him as a rebel . Of course , the stakes are pretty high for Darius too . I mean , let 's not underestimate those . 
If Darius loses , basically , he loses the western part of the Persian empire . 
The terrain of the battlefield really did work against the Persians , particularly because of the size of their army and their dependence on cavalry . 
I mean , basically you 're almost in a little bowl , right ? You know , sort of squashed between the foothills of a not insignificant mountain range and the Mediterranean coast . 
And so , although Darius had a greater number of troops , they 're squashed together , and they don 't have the space to maneuver as effectively as they could on a flatter , more open battlefield . 
Persians are using a force of 100,000 men as opposed to something like 40,000 troops that Alexander has . 
So the odds are certainly stacked against him . 
The Persians become a little bit overconfident because they seem to have superiority in numbers , but what really matters is command and control , not the numbers . 
If Alexander is going to win this battle , then he has to win it on his terms and employ the usual off-center tactics that he 's always employed and have always been successful for him . 
Shields up ! 
The Persians swarm around Alexander 's troops , especially those led by Parmenion . 
It 's looking pretty desperate for them . 
Several major players on the Macedonian side are killed at that point . 
Where the hell is he ? 
Mazaeus . Quickly ! 
Target their left flank . 
Their cavalry is starting to fall . 
I will hit them hard . 
Troops ! Charge ! 
The Persian way of fighting in battle , it tends to be that the commander , in this case , Darius himself , they tend to stay at the center of the army so they 're surrounded . Okay ? So it 's about keeping them safe , but also , of course , issuing orders from the center itself . 
And that 's in complete contrast to Alexander 's way of doing it , who likes to cut through the center all the time and actually get to the head , to the charge . 
We need to buy him more time . 
Hoplites ! 
Hold the line ! Hold the line ! 
Alexander clearly sees that this is not going well . 
One of his major players , Parmenion , his friend , is in desperate danger . 
Alexander suddenly sees that there 's an opening , and , as ever the opportunist , Alexander seizes the moment and takes decisive action . 
Cavalry , on me ! 
- Charge ! 
The war-winning aspect with Alexander 's army is his cavalry . And why is that ? Because he 's able to move . And he 's able to move with alarming speed . 
He kicks things off . 
He starts it with his charge from the right companion cavalry heading towards the Persian lines . 
But this isn 't a haphazard , flat-out gallop towards the Persians . 
Alexander has deliberately picked a spot in the Persian lines that he thinks is going to be the weakest , where he sees the potential for an opening , and it works . 
Hold the line ! 
Hold the line ! 
All the classical sources agree , and it 's even in the iconography as well , that , for the first time , Alexander and Darius lock eyes on one another . 
It must have been quite remarkable . 
You know , these two great kings , these two warriors are there , and the history of the world is going to be formed by what happens in the next few seconds . 
I think if he could 've , he would 've killed Darius there and then . 
Clear a path ! Clear a path ! 
We can 't leave the men ! 
Sir , my duty is to the king , to Persia . 
Move it ! 
No ! 
Darius 's bodyguards are quick to maneuver Darius out of the way . 
They immediately turn the chariot off the field . 
Darius has to leave the battlefield . 
Darius cannot die on that battlefield . 
It 's not because he 's a coward . It 's not because he 's running away for any personal reason . It 's because of what he represents . 
If Darius dies on the battlefield , that is the end of the Persian house . 
Alex , the battle has turned . We can win this . 
No . 
We can win the war . Come ! 
So , basically , Alexander is able to make a tactical assessment of the battlefield really quickly and to respond to it . 
And he sees the weakness in the opposing ranks , and that 's what Alexander takes advantage of . 
It is a very , very bold maneuver . 
And it works . 
With Darius gone from the scene , the instinct that all the Persian soldiers have is to follow their king , of course . And this is essentially what happens . 
First of all , the middle lines , those that were around Darius , go with him until only the front line is left , and they too then begin to peel away . 
And this is when the Macedonians simply hack them down . They are slaughtered to a man as they are leaving the battlefield . 
The loss of the Battle of Issus meant for Darius that his Western satrapies are gone and now are going to be in the hands of Alexander . 
They are facing a new military force , and the traditional Persian army is not capable of withstanding Alexander . 
My king . 
Mazaeus , send word to your garrison to regroup ... 
Sir , please . 
- With the remaining Kardakes ... 
Where are the women ? 
Barsine and Stateira . 
Quickly , give me your horse . 
- Sir ... Sir . 
- We 're going back . 
It 's too dangerous . For Persia , your safety must be the priority . 
But they are Persia ! 
After the battle , Alexander is able to , basically , take the spoils of victory , which is Darius 's camp . 
That camp included Darius 's family . 
So , he advances to the royal tent where we have a rather fateful meeting . 
King Alexander . My husband will not tolerate any bad treatment . 
You 're not Alexander . 
No , he is . 
As much as I am . 
I read that Persian rulers bring their families to battle . 
So this is how Darius wages war . 
Such ... luxury . 
For the Persians , Persianness and the centrality of Persia was everything . 
Civilization was the hub of Persia . 
The further away you went from that , the more barbaric you became . 
So this outcrop of land which is called Macedonia , for the Persians , was the ultimate site of barbarity . 
Just get behind me . 
Stateira would have thought of Alexander as the ultimate barbarian . 
If you even breathe on her ... 
What ? 
- I will make it my mission ... 
- No . 
No . 
What kind of barbarian do you think I am ? 
Please . 
- I 've not harmed you . 
- No . 
And you won 't either . 
Because we have no value to you dead . 
Then , if only in this regard , we have an understanding . 
They can gather their belongings and bring them . 
The women must have been terrified . 
Or if not terrified , resigned to an unenviable fate . 
Let 's be honest . The fate of most women on the losing side of a battle in antiquity was rape and death or enslavement , 
regardless of their status . 
And so , when Alexander entered the tent , they knew they were at his mercy . 
Uh , their fate was entirely in his hands . 
I think taking Darius 's wife and daughter sent a huge signal , uh , to many of the mercenaries and Darius 's immediate followers that the king , who cannot even take care of their own children and wife , 
- Any word ? 
- I have no words . 
- Mazaeus ... 
- We let them be taken . 
Don 't . 
You underestimated Alexander . 
You 're right . 
And for that , I 'm sorry . 
But we are Persians . 
We do not cower . 
We do not panic . 
Certainly not with 60,000 men still on the field . 
What good are they when that thug is holding my fiancÃ © e , your daughter , captive . 
I know . 
I know you 're right . 
They are the world to me . 
So that is what I will offer them . 
What ? 
A bribe ? 
Will that work ? 
Trust me . 
He 's Macedonian . 
Find me a messenger . 
Darius realizes that he needs to get his family back because Stateira , given her high royal status , had provided a legitimacy to him in his early days of kingship . 
So he sends Alexander a letter . 
- We have the momentum . - My king . 
No , Ptolemy , now is not the right time . 
The right time ? Parmenion , his army is scattered . 
They 're licking their wounds . 
Now is the time . Let 's finish this . 
The Persians may be scattered , but they still substantially outnumber us . 
Without reinforcements , we could suffer the fate of Antaeus . 
- He was crushed to death by Herakles . 
- Yeah , I got that one . 
Then perhaps we should just stay here and give up . 
It 's an offer from Darius . 
We keep all the territories and cities we 've taken so far , plus a ransom . 
Ten thousand gold talents . 
- What does he ask in return ? 
- His family , mainly . 
But also an end to our war . 
It 's a bribe for my obedience . 
It 's a good offer , sir . 
Think of all the cities you conquered for Macedon . 
If I were Alexander , I would take it . 
And if I were Parmenion , I would too . 
Alex , it pains me , but ... He 's right . 
You 've proved yourself , more than anyone could 've envisioned . 
If I consider this , I am no better than Attalus . 
Taking the Persian coin with my head bowed ? 
And what is the alternative ? 
Stretch our dwindling resources to breaking point ? 
And thereby , truly test our mettle ? 
Well , I hope , for your sake , Parmenion , it doesn 't come to that . 
Look at you all . 
Am I the only one who still has fire in his heart ? 
The classical sources suggest that rather than go headlong into battle again , 
Darius was prepared to offer Alexander , uh , various gifts , everything from gold and silver coinage , or even , one classical source says , half of his empire . 
That is to say , if Alexander now takes everything that he conquered so far , Darius would be satisfied , and let 's just call it quits . 
Good morning . 
I trust the new accommodation is to your liking ? 
The beds comfortable ? 
Is there something you need ? 
Please , sit . 
It would be very unusual for Alexander not to seek to gain information out of his captives . 
It would be almost negligent of him not to . 
We don 't know , for instance , if Stateira had a rapport with Alexander . 
You know , could he have gone to her for advice about her husband , the running of the empire ? We simply don 't know . 
It 's pretty clear if they 're there in the baggage train , they would 've been a valuable source of information for Alexander about what 's going on at the inner sanctum of the Persian Empire , and also , all sorts of things about the psychology of Darius would 've been revealed . 
If you 're the wife and daughter of the Persian king who 's just abandoned you to your enemy , you 're probably not going to be entirely complimentary about what your husband or father has done . 
Egypt ... What do you know of it ? 
You want me to draw you a pyramid ? 
No , I mean , what are his defenses ? Troop numbers , cavalry ... ? 
And you think I would be party to that kind of detail ? 
Yes , I do . 
It is the only jewel in the Persian crown more prized than you . 
Its riches fill the Persian treasury . 
The crops of the Nile delta fill the bellies of your subjects . 
It 's why Artaxerxes built an army of 350,000 just to conquer it and gentrify all those barbarians . 
Seems you already know a great deal . 
Only what anyone can learn from a book . 
I want to know what Egypt can teach me itself . What a place like that can show me . 
So , all that 's stopping you are 50,000 elite troops who 've sworn allegiance to my husband . 
Then again ... he did once share a hated enemy . 
Us . 
So maybe all you barbarians have more in common than you think . 
Mother . What do you think you 're doing ? 
Right now ? Surviving . 
Persian royal women were not silent partners . 
They had a long , long history of being determined go-getters . 
And if Stateira was representative of any of the line of Persian women that had gone before her , then I think she would have played on this situation and maximized on it as best as she could . 
Sir . Have you decided how to respond to the Persian offer ? 
I have . 
Good . 
To the esteemed Darius Codomannus , son of Arsames and current king of Persia ... 
No . 
As I , Alexander of Macedon , am now the de facto king of all Asia , it is up to me , and me alone , to decide upon territorial divisions . 
My decision is this . 
I 'm coming for you and your throne . 
Ptol , send that immediately . 
The rest of you , prepare the troops and take on water . 
Tomorrow , we march south to Egypt . 
Egypt , where an entire garrison of Persian infantry awaits us ? 
Well , it 's bold . 
I 'll give him that . 
It 's a death wish is what it is . 
Heph ? 
You need to make your friend see his mistake . 
Now . 
Or we will all die and it would be for nothing . 
So you might think that immediately following his success at Issus that Alexander would continue his pursuit of Darius , get it done . 
But , in a very Alexander way , he doesn 't . Instead , he goes to Egypt . 
Alexander was probably interested and somewhat obsessed by Egypt when he was quite young . 
He had read about it , Aristotle had taught him about it , and Egypt featured in sort of the mythos of the world . 
Egypt is wealthy in terms of financial resources , but when you have an army , you have to feed that army , and Egypt was one of the breadbaskets of the ancient world . 
It produced a huge volume of grain . 
So for Alexander to control Egypt would make it easier to have access to the supplies he needed for his army . 
Poor Heph . 
They sent the friend to talk down the madman . 
No . 
No , not talk down . 
Understand . 
What is there to understand ? 
Why you would march us through a burning desert for weeks just to see us climb into a lion 's mouth . 
What if I 've been told the lion might be friendlier than we think ? 
And who told you that ? 
Alex , who told you that ? Stateira ? 
I need to listen to all voices , Heph . 
Well , then listen to mine . 
I know this goes against all military sense . 
But what if it 's not a military decision ? 
What if it 's something I have to do before I face Darius ? 
You remember Homer 's writings . " The journey is the thing . " 
Well , I finally found my destination . 
The question is , will you follow ? 
What is faith but a journey ? 
A pilgrimage that may lead you through fire or hell itself that may be beset by doubt ... or a dread of what is to come . 
Alexander has arrived at the gates of Pelusium . 
Pelusium ? 
Are you sure ? 
Straight towards several thousand loyal troops ready to liberate the royal women on your behalf , sir . 
Looks like the boy king may have just made his first tactical error . 
And maybe his last . 
But one that if you can hold fast and keep your nerve ... 
So , what now ? 
... a most glorious destination awaits .
