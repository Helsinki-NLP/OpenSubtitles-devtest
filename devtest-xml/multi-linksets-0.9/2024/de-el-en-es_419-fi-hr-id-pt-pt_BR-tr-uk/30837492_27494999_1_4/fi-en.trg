What is the prize that only the mighty have conquered and kept ? 
A place whose wealth , beauty , and history have obsessed Alexander since childhood . 
It is the ancient , glittering jewel . 
Egypt . 
Em hotep nefer ! 
Brother , I don 't think we 're welcome here . 
Hotep ! 
Good people of Egypt . 
Please , Alex . 
What in the name of gods is he doing ? 
Em hotep nefer . 
Do you know what that even means ? 
I come in peace . 
Really ? 
You seek peace with Egypt ? 
Yes . 
And much more . Such as ? 
Such as liberation . 
Welcome to Egypt , Alexander . 
Egypt was one of the most important components of the Persian Empire because of its vast wealth . 
Egypt was always known as the breadbasket of antiquity because it produced more fertile soil , and , therefore , more wheat and barley than anywhere else in the Persian Empire . 
And yet the relationship between Egypt and the Persian Empire had always been a fractious one . 
It had often broken away from the empire , had been reconquered , and , even under Darius III , of course , it was in a rather perilous position . 
I think there was an increasing awareness of a kind of an independence movement in Egypt . 
Egypt 's kind of cut off by this point . 
You know , Alexander 's got a massively successful army . 
If Egypt resists him , who 's gonna come to their aid ? 
So it may just have seemed like the easier thing to do , the logical thing to do . Hand Egypt over to Alexander and hope that everything goes smoothly . 
You know that in my official capacity as viceroy to King Darius ... I should have you beheaded right here . 
So why shouldn 't I give that order ? 
Satrap Mazaces . 
I slaughtered your predecessor when he led the Egyptian garrison against us at the Battle of Issus . 
The sand ran red with their blood . 
All of them . Summoned and massacred . 
And in whose name ? 
Darius . 
That heartless Persian who demands Egypt calls him king but has never cared to visit . 
Who sees Egypt as nothing more than providing grain and gold for his empire . 
What do you see ? 
The center of the civilized world . 
A place of beauty , history , and endless potential . 
With a people who should be nurtured and protected . 
Not slaughtered . 
Then ... it will need a protector . 
One that the world will know and fear ... from here all the way to Persia . 
I think that the Egyptians almost wholeheartedly welcome Alexander . 
After all , one foreign ruler is like another foreign ruler . 
For the Egyptians , when Alexander came , for them , it was like a godsend because they wanted to get rid of the Persians , and here was someone who wanted to get rid of the Persians for them and who had the military might that would make it possible . 
They 're more than happy to say , " Welcome " in Egypt , and basically let him in so that he could do the work for them . 
But they see in Alexander , clearly , a way to get rid of the hated Persians , and they offer Alexander the , the crown of Egypt . 
There was a big coronation ceremony , which was done the way it would have been done for an Egyptian pharaoh . 
Alexander 's coronation was important in many ways . 
First of all , it gave him legitimacy . 
So the Egyptians could say , " Yes , you are a legitimate pharaoh because you 've gone through the right ceremonies . " " You have been crowned in Memphis . " 
Hail the son of Ra . 
Our blessed and beloved Pharaoh . 
And having someone who also embraces Egyptian religion in this way , that was just perfect . 
This must have been really the first major step in achieving his ambitions and really creating what became his persona . 
So it must have been a big head rush . 
Pharaoh ? 
So not just a cowardly surrender . They made him a living god ? 
What kind of conspiracy is this ? 
I understand they also presented him with a gift , sir . 
Eight hundred gold talents . 
Then how revealing is this gift from Egypt . 
Filthy insects . 
No better than the excrement they feed on . 
Then again , sir , as Queen Stateira said ... 
But she 's not here ! 
Is she ? 
Right now , we don 't even know whether she 's alive or dead . 
Look around you ! 
My empire ! 
All the pomp and state and military might . All the riches of Croesus . 
But in reality it all counts for nothing . 
The loss of Egypt for Darius was a further blow into his prestige and the reach of the empire . 
It showed that the empire has certain weaknesses , and it cannot control the distant satrapies . 
All hail the son of Ra . 
That was a great honor . 
What an honor indeed . 
Did you ever consider my ambition may extend beyond war to something more ? 
Something much greater ? 
From Stateira 's point of view , I suppose there are two ways of thinking of her situation . 
She could either have been completely repulsed by this barbarian using her sexually in this way and have never come to terms with it . 
Or , if we want to see her as taking certain agency for herself , maybe she went along willingly with this because maybe she sees in Alexander the possibility of her future as the Queen of Persia continuing . 
The capture of Stateira would have been a huge blow to Darius on any level , to his status , to his standing in the eyes of the Persians . 
Darius III wasn 't from the royal noble line . 
Through marrying Stateira , a Persian noble lady , he was able to elevate his position as someone worthy for the Persian throne . 
Alexander has inherited the Egyptian throne from Darius . 
He 's become a ... a living god , as far as the Egyptians are concerned , and like everybody who conquers Egypt , eventually , the conqueror becomes conquered by Egyptian culture . 
And I think Alexander just wants to leave his mark on Egypt , and what he does there , of course , is leave his mark in the most phenomenal way . 
He founds a city , and he names it after himself . 
He founds Alexandria . 
What 's this ? 
What are you doing here , Alexander ? 
Building a city , the greatest the world 's ever seen . 
The walls will be brilliant white , so the sunlight reflects its beauty . 
In time , these lines will become roads . Buildings , a port . 
A vast metropolis built by the very best of Greek architecture . 
Looks like you 've got it all planned out . 
Yes . 
The idea came to me in a dream . 
It 's a new kind of city . 
Not just a center of commerce and trade , but a symbol of culture . Of learning and knowledge . 
For me , it can 't exist anywhere but right here . 
In Egypt . 
This was basically a tiny little village , but Alexander saw tactical advantages to having an outpost on the sea . 
It shall be built here . 
And he then laid out this city and said , you know , " This is going to be Alexandria . " 
This will house a record of our entire history . 
And indeed , this became one of the most important cities on the Mediterranean . 
Traces of the real world of Alexander , of course , still survive , and they are emerging from the archeology . 
If we dig in Alexandria , it 's almost like cutting through a slice of cake , where we can see the layers of habitation there . 
And we know that somewhere on this bottom layer , beneath the Arab , beneath the Christian , beneath the Roman layer , is going to be the layer of Alexander 's world itself . 
It 's sitting there . We just have to find it . 
My mission and my dream is to find this Greek Alexandria , the Alexandria of Alexander . 
Look how deep we arrived in order to find the layer where Alexander built the city . 
This is about ten meters and a half . 
This is our secret of success . 
So we are now in the deepest layer of the city of Alexandria . 
After these stones , there is nothing . 
What we know about ancient Alexandria comes from classical writers and that is how we know where the Royal Quarter should be and what should be in it . So , in fact , they describe Alexandria as having two major roads , and at the intersection where they cross is where the Royal Quarter was located at the heart of the city . 
After moving tons and tons of earth , Dr. Pepi made a discovery that suddenly changed everything for her . 
A limestone ? 
- This ? Yes . 
We uncovered the main broad road of Alexandria . 
The Royal Road . 
This is one of the two broad streets that Alexander himself planned . 
One important evidence , according to the maps we have , is the direction of the road . 
It was the road that the kings were using to go from their palaces from the port of Alexandria to the port of the lake . 
And now she thinks that she is really honing in on the Royal Quarter because she has found actually what might be the foundations of a large building . 
When these stones appeared , it was a great day for me because , maybe for the first time in the Royal Quarter , we see evidence of the buildings that were here . 
The size of this building is huge . 
We have arrived in a length of 50 meters , so we can compare it even with Parthenon . 
That means this was a very important building . 
One of the interesting finds associated with the building is plaster . 
Dr. Pepi has found lots and lots and lots of fragments of painted plaster , which shows how the building was decorated . 
Here we have samples . 
Strong red , nice yellow , and a big quantity of light blue . 
Light blue is not the Egyptian blue . It 's the Greek blue . 
When we first saw these colored fragments of plaster , I was so excited because I never saw that in Alexandria before . 
We know that these colors decorated the tombs in Macedonia , and this is , for the first time , we find something like that in the Royal Quarter of Alexandria . 
Besides , we find architectural pieces , and a nice surprise was the colored one with egg motif , pure , typical Macedonian Greek style . 
I 'm sure that it is one of the famous buildings we know that were inside the Royal Quarter . 
The library , the museum , and the tomb of Alexander . 
And from the size and the construction , we understand how glorious this building should be . 
Having laid down the foundations of Alexandria , Alexander doesn 't linger in the area , and that 's because , basically , he 's a man on a mission . 
He 's got a ... a spiritual quest to go on . 
You 're going to Siwa ? 
Yes . 
You know , mythical temple in the depths of the Great Sand Sea . 
Ptol . 
It 's just a symptom of madness to even consider that journey . 
It 's not madness , General . 
No ? 
Siwa is in this direction . Persia is this way . 
What am I missing ? 
- He needs to see the high priest . 
- And our men need to fight . 
That journey will take months . If you make it out alive . 
What are the men supposed to do in the meantime ? 
Let them rest . 
Let them enjoy Egyptian hospitality . 
They 've earned it . With the war coming , it may be the last chance they get . 
Sir , with respect , we will lose any strategic advantage we had over the Persians . 
Have faith , Parmenion . 
I 've led you to victory before . 
And I will do it again . 
But only when the time is right . 
And you are in favor of this jaunt ? 
He 's the king . 
Doesn 't matter what I think . 
I don 't care how native he has become , how the foreign in him strengthens , while the Macedon in him weakens . 
I do . 
I came here to fight , not to see the damn sights . 
Alexander did something extraordinary in Egypt . 
Instead of going on to conquer the rest of the Persian empire , he takes a detour going to Siwa , which is a small oasis in the western desert , closer to Libya than anywhere else , and he goes there because it 's famed for its oracle . 
Alexander had already been crowned pharaoh , but he wants to go to the oracle at Siwa , perhaps because he wants spiritual legitimacy as well as political legitimacy . 
Alexander 's journey to Siwa must have been arduous . 
We should imagine him day after day , high , high temperatures . 
Alexander 's aim to get to Siwa obviously drives him forward . 
So tell me , Alex . Why are we risking certain death again ? 
Greatness , Ptol . 
Greatness . 
- Ah , yes . 
- I 've missed this . 
Adventuring together . 
Isn 't that all we do now ? Without distractions , I mean . 
She had nothing to do with this . 
- I knew I 'd make this trip before we left . - I know . 
It 's just nice to get you to myself for a few weeks . 
And all I had to do was volunteer for this suicidal lunacy . 
Again , isn 't that all we do now ? 
Sir , I have news . 
We have located your wife and daughter . 
Tell me . Are they in Macedon ? 
No , sir . 
Egypt . 
When Alexander took Pelusium , the women were there with him . 
Our source says they are in good health and being treated well . 
Almost too well . 
What was that , Governor ? 
Sir . They 're not prisoners . 
They 're guests , paraded at his side and kept in his own royal quarters . 
Barsine too . 
Sir . He 's treating your queen like his own . 
They are women ... alone ... in the company of savages . 
Stateira only has a number of cards to play to survive . 
That bastard ! 
I will kill him . 
I will rip him apart with my own bare hands ! I swear it to God . 
But you might not have to , my king . 
There was more news . 
Alexander has not turned his forces towards Persia as expected . 
Instead , he has set out with a small caravan across the Great Sand Sea . 
The desert ? 
The very same that swallowed King Cambyses himself . 
And whether it be the heat or the raging sand , it will swallow him too . I know it . 
So our empire and everyone we love 
is threatened by a tyrant , but you are pinning our hopes on a sandstorm ... to blow him away . 
And what would you suggest , sir ? 
No more excuses ! 
No more waiting for the gods to intervene . 
We will be the storm , Bessus . 
We will be the storm , Bessus . 
Oh , no , thank you . 
- Sorry . What I mean is I don 't want ... 
- She doesn 't want tea . 
She 's feeling sick due to her condition . 
That doesn 't concern you , Barsine . 
What ? 
That I am to have a bastard sibling by the enemy ? 
Mind your tongue . 
How could you , Maman ? 
How could I what ? 
Keep us alive ? 
Call it that if it makes you feel better . 
But it is a betrayal . 
Of Papa , of Persia itself . 
But look around you , Barsine . 
This is not Persia . 
This is not our home . 
We 're not royal here . 
We 're Persian pawns in this violent war . 
And the only protection you have is what I can leverage . 
This is the real world . 
I 'm so sorry , Maman . 
Then , for both our sakes , we must pray for his safe return . 
Alexander would have been told that 200 years before him , the Persian king Cambyses had tried to move his army across this vast desert , but had failed and had lost tens of thousands of soldiers in this vast , unforgiving wilderness . 
Everybody find cover . Now ! 
Take cover ! 
Oh , my eyes ! 
Alex ! 
- I 'm with you , brother ! 
Hold on ! 
Ptolemy . 
Alexander ! 
Quickly ! 
Alex ! Alex ! 
Ptolemy , you all right ? 
Alex ! 
Right . 
Suicidal lunacy , yes ? 
What did I say ? 
That 's all we do . 
Still alive ? 
Oh , the blessed gods ! 
It has passed . 
All the trails , our path ... They 're gone . 
Going to Siwa was no picnic because it 's really in the middle of the Sahara Desert . 
Cambyses 's army had been entirely consumed by a sandstorm , so Alexander was doing something that was both brave but also foolhardy . 
Alex . 
I just need a moment . 
No , you really don 't . 
It 's Siwa . 
We 're here . 
We made it . 
That damn snake , huh ? 
This trip to Siwa is a very important part of Alexander 's PR campaign to show that he has divine sonship . 
And this part is just as important to him as the military victories . 
So this trip to Siwa is part and parcel of Alexander 's entire program , and without it , he would not be the king that we know him to be . 
We have been waiting for you , Alexander .
