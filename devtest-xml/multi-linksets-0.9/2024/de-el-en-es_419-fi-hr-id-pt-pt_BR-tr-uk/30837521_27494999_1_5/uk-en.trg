Into each life comes adversity . 
What is there to understand ? 
Why you would march us through a burning desert for weeks , just to see us climb into a lion 's mouth ? 
What if it 's something I have to do before I face Darius ? 
But for those who seek greatness , they must take the hardest path , the road less traveled . 
They must pass through the tempest , the eye of the storm . 
But this is how the gods test us . 
For it is only in the eye of that storm where we find if we are truly worthy , how they challenge us to recognize what is truly important ... 
Alex ? 
... what is worth fighting for ... and what is worth moving heaven and earth to protect . 
We have been waiting for you , Alexander . 
You know who I am ? 
The world knows who you are . 
The question is , do you ? 
Two bitter enemies worlds apart . 
But two sides of the same coin . 
A young Macedonian prince fighting for his country and for his own name . 
And a Persian king determined to defend the greatest empire on earth . 
But who shall be victorious ? 
The gods will decide . 
So ... this war , the worlds I fight for , everything I do in pursuit of some higher meaning is pointless ? 
That is not what I said . 
And it is not what you feel within . 
But what if I fail ? 
The child of a god cannot fail . 
My mother ... She told me that . 
She told you only what you needed to hear to set you on the path . 
The path to where ? 
Let me show you . 
We simply do not know what happens in that inner sanctuary in the Temple of Amun at Siwa . 
Our sources are at loggerheads with each other here . 
But one thing is certain , is that Alexander comes out of the experience a changed man . 
He claims that the Oracle pronounced that he was the son of the god Amun . 
And whether it is a fervent spiritual belief of his or whether it is an incredible piece of politics , he projects himself from here on in as a living , breathing god . 
Everybody back ! 
Guards ! 
Control this crowd ! 
Ptol , it 's okay . 
Really . 
Alexander spends the night at the temple in Siwa , and there , the Oracle speaks to him . 
Alexander , keep moving . 
When he comes out , he says that the god Amun-Ra claimed him as his son . 
And so , Alexander is also divine and , therefore , obviously the legitimate ruler of Egypt , and certainly for the Egyptians , he is a god from that point on . 
Alexander ! General . 
Alexander . 
It 's good to see you . 
A living god ? 
The High Priest confirmed it . 
Apparently , he 's the son of Zeus . 
Well , then , if he is not Philip 's son , is he really our king ? 
- It 's not a joke , General . 
The troops are getting fractious . 
They 've done nothing but train for months . 
Then they 'll be ready to fight for Macedon . 
But will Alexander ? 
Doesn 't it bother you ? 
Him here , in his Egyptian clothes , learning Persian from the enemy 's wife . 
He 's going native . A pharaoh . 
Now a god . Where does it all end ? 
With a glorious victory over Persia . 
Does it ? 
I need to know that he is still with us . 
And you too . 
Why go to the oracle of an Egyptian deity , Amun ? 
Well , the Greeks were quite flexible in their understanding of their gods . 
They accepted that perhaps their gods could go by different names in different places and so , although it was the oracle of Amun in Egypt , the Greeks associated Amun with Zeus . 
So , in going to that oracle , it 's also like Alexander was getting recognition from Zeus as well . They would 've been one and the same to the Greeks . 
Again . 
Again . 
I 've never seen him like this . 
Right now , he would take on all of Macedon if it would save Stateira from that savage . 
Let 's not over-egg the idea that it 's all over for Darius . 
He 's still got substantial territories from Babylon all the way through to Northern India and Pakistan . 
But we can 't deny that the loss of Asia Minor , the Levant , Egypt , to Alexander is an enormous blow . That was a substantial part of his kingdom gone . 
Plus the fact now , he 's lost his wife , he 's losing confidence with his chief advisors , ministers , and council of war . 
It is looking dodgy for him . But the game isn 't over yet . 
My king , I bring news . 
Of Alexander 's death , I hope . 
No , sir . 
My hope he would have been swallowed by the Great Sand Sea proved optimistic . 
He returned from the Temple of Siwa a few days ago to some excitement , it would seem . 
Excitement ? 
Rumor amongst the locals is that the high priestess at Siwa has declared him the rightful pharaoh . 
More than that son of Zeus-Amun , sir . 
A living god . 
Then it seems I am to be a god killer . 
I have a little something to tell you . 
I have a little news myself . 
I 'm afraid your news has already spread like wildfire . 
Is he going to be known as the son of the son of God ? 
Alexander . You need to come with me . 
It 's urgent . 
By this stage in Alexander 's life , I think his heart is no longer Macedonian per se , but here 's a young man experiencing a much wider world with a great cultural depth to it . 
And I just think he happily buys in to whatever he encounters next . 
I think that 's the thing with Alexander . He 's incredibly receptive to the next thing that opens up to him . 
Well , this doesn 't feel welcoming . 
We are concerned , the leaders of your army . 
May I speak my mind , sir ? 
You 've earned that right , General . 
Then hear me when I say we have lost all focus on our mission . 
You might be worshiped here by the Egyptians , but our men will never bow down to one of their own . 
Now , wait a minute , General . I know my men . 
Theirs is a faith that needs to be earned in great deeds . 
Then I will earn that faith . I promise you . 
We 'll make preparations to leave Egypt immediately and face Darius on the field . 
But I must have loyalty . 
Especially among those that I depend on most . 
Did I not lead you to victory at Granicus ? 
Halicarnassus ? 
Issus and Tyre ? 
So I ask all of you right now to make your choice . 
Go with my blessing . 
Or pledge your life to me all the way to the gates of Babylon and Persia beyond . 
What do you say ? 
I agree with you , General . 
Out here , how they worship my oldest friend , it 's ... It feels like hysteria . 
It does . 
But they are willing to follow him to the ends of the world . 
And that belief , that faith in him ... it can level armies , entire cities . 
They 're ready to fight to the death to win a war in his name . 
The least we can do ... is show them how . 
So am I with you , my king ? 
Nai ! 
Nai ! Nai ! Nai ! 
Nai . 
Ptolemy 's dilemma is palpable . 
He was probably the person who knew Alexander best of all of his generals . 
They 'd grown up together since boyhood . He knew him intimately . 
And so , for Alexander to now present himself to Ptolemy as this god-king , and an Egyptian-style god-king at that , is so unpalatable to Ptolemy and to the rest of the ... the Macedonians , of course . 
But there is an irony to all of this , and that is , in years to come , Ptolemy himself , of course , was going to be crowned as the pharaoh of Egypt , the Lord of the Two Lands , and he himself was made into a living god . 
Thank you , Ptol . 
For your faith in me . 
Faith ? 
It 's not faith , Alexander . 
It 's friendship . 
And it 's blood . 
Because I know that for all of this , you are still Macedon to the bone . 
Sir , the magi , what did they say ? 
The usual . 
Omens of victory , vague warnings of doom , empty words . 
Are the generals all assembled ? 
They 're ready for your orders , my king . 
I can assure you , Bessus , they are not . 
I don 't think there 's any doubt whatsoever that after Issus , Darius is hemorrhaging support from the political elite . 
They 're starting to have doubts . They don 't know whether this guy 's gonna survive . It ... It 's really quite chaotic . 
If you can imagine that you 've had this imperial system in place for 200 years , it 's very disruptive to everyone . They don 't know what comes in its place , what 's happening . 
So , really , for Darius , he 's got one very last throw of the dice . 
I think a big showdown somewhere was inevitable . 
Alexander still has a huge numerical disadvantage , even with his Egyptian reinforcement . 
We estimate 30,000 heavy infantry , 7,000 cavalry . 
Which means ... we can easily contain his forces here ... 
My king ? 
No , no , no . 
No , Mazaeus . 
I 've read those reports too . 
He 's restored army morale and won the hearts of the Egyptian people . 
He even has a new nickname . 
Alexander the Invincible . 
So , no . 
We will not contain him . 
We need to destroy him . 
So , I am hereby mobilizing the Immortal guards , the hoplites , the scythed chariots , as well as the cavalries of the Eastern satrapies , the Indian garrison , and the allied Scythian tribes . 
In fact ... send everything . 
Then let us see how this Alexander the Invincible fares against the entire Persian Empire . 
Indeed , sir . 
A great army . 
Truly inspired . 
Mazaeus ? 
Yes , my king ? 
I know you 'll want to be at the vanguard , so ride out and determine Alexander 's route . 
Then burn all the crops between us . 
We need to starve them out . 
But be aware . That will harm our people too . 
It 's two years since the Battle of Issus . 
Things are looking grim for Darius . 
The war is not over yet . 
He has been in Babylon all this time , putting troops together , bringing in more mercenaries . 
Darius is all set again for the fight . 
Yes . 
Stateira had been separated from Darius III for two years at this point , so it is out of the question that Darius could have fathered this child , of course . 
So that leaves Alexander or his men . 
Now , I do not think that Alexander would have conceivably allowed anyone to have sexual relations with this queen of Persia , which leads me to believe that the father of that child can only have been Alexander himself . 
Maman ? 
Maman ? 
Stateira and the baby do not survive the traumas of childbirth . 
Alexander 's biographer , the historian Plutarch , specifically names Stateira , and he tells us the circumstances in which she died . 
That 's extremely unusual for Plutarch or any other historian of the time . 
The second thing is we can trace the events that lead up to Stateira 's death in the Babylonian evidence from the astronomical charts . 
Alexander seems to have at least made a show of mourning Stateira 's death . 
We know from our sources that he provided her with a lavish funeral that seems to have been in concert with her station in Persian society . 
And so at least Alexander made a political performance out of her death . 
My king . A message has arrived from Alexander . 
Darius should hear of her passing from me , not his spies . 
Yes , my king . 
But , Ptol ? Make sure you tell him how she died . 
Your wife ... She died giving birth ... to a son . 
We really see Alexander there just twisting the knife deliberately . 
Bessus , she was lost . 
And I failed her . 
Sir . We are soldiers . 
We are Persia . 
Sir ? 
They 're waiting for you . 
Stand guard ! Stateira being alive gives Darius more legitimacy . 
He wasn 't a direct heir to the throne . 
She was a Persian royal woman . She was of high status . 
And so , her connection to Darius gave Darius more authority and more of a right to rule . 
Her loss means that 's been cut off from him . 
Interestingly , at this period , one of our key players , Mazaeus , comes back into focus . 
He 's Darius 's great confidant . He 's one of his chief advisors , one of his go-to men , and we find at this point , increasingly , those who are loyal to Darius start to move away from him . Some of them actually even start to go over to Alexander 's camp . 
And one later tradition , outside the Alexander historians , suggests that Hephaestion actually met with Mazaeus and persuaded him to go over to Alexander 's side . 
You know I 'm duty bound to gut you like a fish right here . 
But before you do , you should know that Barsine is alive and well . 
Untouched ? 
Not a hair on her head . 
And King Alexander promises that she will remain this way under his personal protection . 
But he cannot keep his promise if he loses . 
Why are you telling me this ? 
Perhaps you can help save Barsine and remain governor of Babylon . 
Darius has been trying to avoid another pitched battle , and you cannot blame him for that . 
This was a disaster for the Persian side , but Alexander is having none of it . 
He is determined to show his military expertise to capture Darius and to literally take the Persian Empire for himself . 
And so , it 's inevitable that the two have to meet on the battlefield again . 
They can only dance around each other like two territorial dogs for so long before they have to come to blows . 
Darius leads his army to an area that the locals called the Place of the Camel , 
Gaugamela is situated in modern-day Iraq , north of Babylon . 
Alexander and his men were pushing through the desert of Iraq to get to this place , and when they arrived at their eventual campsite , they were thirsty , hungry , and exhausted already . 
Meanwhile , Darius and his men had set up camp . They were well-fed , well-watered , rested . 
If Alexander has already crossed the Tigris ... he will be just days away . 
You saw his cavalry , yes ? 
Mazaeus . 
Yes , sir . 
From a distance . 
Then he will take the direct southeastern route to Babylon . 
Mazaeus , ride out with your cavalry and prepare the plains for battle . Do it . 
Do it now ! 
Yes , my king . 
For Mazaeus , this is a moment where he begins to question what Darius is all about . 
Uh , and so , you really begin to see this certain anxiety emerge in him about Darius 's qualities as a king . 
My king ! 
Bessus ! 
You must see this . 
Darius seems to be trapped in this whirlwind of bad news all the time , and suddenly , out of the night sky , comes the worst omen he could possibly have , and that 's a lunar eclipse . 
The skies darken , and the moon turns bloodred . 
Mazaeus . Quickly , spread the word . 
The magi have decreed this foretells of a great victory . 
That is all . 
My king ... 
Do you understand ? 
Yes , my king . 
Immediately . 
Sir , I suspect the magi would see this omen differently . 
Yes . 
They would . 
Find me a runner . 
I need to send Alexander a message . 
- Let me call back Governor Mazaeus . 
He can be your envoy . 
No , Bessus . 
He must never know . 
As with these things in these times , these are omens , and they 're taken as omens by either side about what it means and interpreted in different ways . 
And it 's more than likely that , from the Persian point of view , it would 've been seen as the great king , in this case , Darius , being eclipsed by the new challenger , and that would have been Alexander . 
Conversely , in Alexander 's camp , who witnessed the same eclipse , of course , there , Alexander 's priests say , " Nothing to worry about here . " 
" This bodes badly for Darius , but for you , this is a good sign . " 
You 've seen it . 
Well ... - You can 't exactly miss it . - Hm . 
You 're right . 
What 's worrying you , old friend ? 
What worries me is the thousands of men over that hill that want to kill us . 
That we might be outnumbered five to one . 
That we 're walking into this behind a man who thinks he 's invincible . 
And that might be the sign he 's very much not . 
Alexander has requested our presence . 
A message has arrived from Darius himself . 
What is it ? 
A demand for surrender ? 
Nope . 
It 's another desperate offer . 
In return for peace , Darius will give me all the territory west of the Euphrates and 30,000 silver talents . 
I take it it 's not enough ? 
No . 
He did leave a little extra bonus to sweeten the deal though . 
What ? 
The hand in marriage of his daughter Barsine . 
Seriously ? 
She 's already betrothed to Governor Mazaeus , his most loyal general . 
What 's he thinking ? 
Exactly . 
If he 's making an offer like that , what 's going through his head ? 
Let Darius know I will not accept . 
Wait . 
Alex . We can use this . 
We return Darius 's offer along with a message from you declining it . 
But we send it care of Governor Mazaeus himself , with instructions to deliver it to his beloved king . 
As Darius is trying to negotiate , Alexander 's also planning ahead , and so , Alexander sends Mazaeus a little note being , 
" Hey , you thought you were gonna get to marry the great king 's daughter . " 
" Well , he 's changing his mind about that . " 
" So maybe don 't believe everything he tells you . " 
And this is an important part of Alexander 's strategy as well , not just winning victories on the battlefield but also manipulating personalities and relationships behind the scenes as well . 
This must have put Mazaeus in a difficult position , because who do you believe ? 
Do you believe the Macedonian , who could be telling the truth , or could be lying through his teeth ? 
While you 're here , place a garrison on guard throughout the night . 
I don 't want a surprise attack . 
So , Mazaeus has to decide who does he sort of throw his weight behind ? 
Does he continue to support his great king and do what he can to defend Persia from the Macedonians ? 
Or does he start to question where he belongs and who will be more beneficial to him ? 
This war will soon be over , my friend . 
It is human nature to try to bend the fates in their favor ... because they refuse to see what destiny is . 
That for all their plans for all their paranoia , they ignore the only truth that matters . 
That their lives are in the lap of the gods . 
Charge !
