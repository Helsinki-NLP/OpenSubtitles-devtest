My name is Rusty Sabich , and I am the prosecutor in this trial . 
Sitting over there is the accused , James McDavid , and I can tell you that he sits there not guilty because that is what our constitution demands . 
Now , I will present evidence to show you that the accused committed this crime . 
And should you find that to be likely ... likely ... you got to vote not guilty . 
Should you find that to be very likely , you have to set him free . 
My job is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ... and being on a jury , that is a high calling . 
And being entrusted with the prosecution , satisfying the burden of proof , that is also a high calling . 
I will live up to my duty , and I ask that you rise up to yours . 
Let 's do our jobs , shall we ? 
That 's way high . Way high . 
Come on . Give me some more . Just focus . Take a breath . 
Hey , just take a breath . 
You 're rushing it all . Just breathe . 
How 's it going out there ? Nice . I heard something about runners on second and third . 
Not the testicles ! Nasty ! 
Hey , guys , I thought we said no curveballs . 
Let the boy pitch , hon . Just let the boy pitch . 
- Dad . - Yeah ? It 's Raymond . 
You threw a couple great ones today . 
There must be some new poll out or something . You have got to be kidding me . 
When ? 
Yeah . I 'll be right there . 
Barbara , can I talk to you for a second ? 
Yeah . Sure . 
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered . 
When ? 
I don 't know . I have to ... I 'm gonna ... I have to go . I 'll be back . 
You don 't wanna go in there . It 's bad . 
All right . Make sure you glove up . 
I should take the case , ' cause something of this stature should be either Rusty or me , - and Rusty 's too close . - No , I need to be in charge . And why is that , exactly ? 
Well , first of all , because Raymond asked me to be , and he still is the district attorney , Nico , however much you want that title . 
And second , I 'm better than Tommy , so ... 
Okay , look . For the record , until I win the election ... and I 'm going to win ... I will remain your loyal and trusted servant . 
It 's Rusty 's case , all right ? 
Tommy , you cannot see straight on things . Admit it . Your view is likely obstructed by Nico 's sphincter . 
- You dismiss me at your peril . - Fuck off . 
I just want the best lawyer for the job , and it 's Rusty . 
Eugenia , can you please ask Rigo to meet me in my office ? Okay , yeah . 
I know . I know . 
Oh , Jesus Christ . 
Rigo , what do you got ? 
PD 's on forensics , night of timeline , last known contacts . 
Where are we starting ? Recent releases . TCS parolees . 
- You think it was revenge ? - I don 't know . Who knows ? I don 't know . 
When the labs come in , can you just make sure that they come only to me ? To me only . Not to Molto or Delay . 
Yeah , you got it . 
One of Raymond Horgan 's top lieutenants , a tough prosecutor with political aspirations of her own , Miss Polhemus was reportedly bludgeoned to death in her home , her housekeeper discovering her body shortly after ten o 'clock this morning . 
And it 's been a rough day on Wall Street with prices on the Dow ... Our hearts go out to Carolyn and her loving family . 
We 're all quite rightly stunned and rattled by such a grotesque and heartless act of violence . 
And to the public at large , we hear your anguish and your fear because we feel it too . 
It is difficult for the citizenry to feel safe when we can 't even protect our own prosecutors . 
- Wow . Such a dick . - We have to do better . 
We must do better , frankly . - He 's not wasting any time , is he ? 
You okay ? Yeah . 
I will try and be here for you ... But I can 't do the memorial . 
I understand . 
Thanks for coming today . Thanks for ... Thank you . 
How are we doing ? 
Same as you , I guess . 
You know anything more ? 
No , not much , but I got Rigo on it . 
You know , the clock is ticking on this , and my expiration date is in the crosshairs . 
Oh , well , don 't worry . We 're gonna find out who did this . 
Who 's our ME ? Painless . 
- Kumagai . Jesus fucking Christ . - Raymond . 
- Delay . - I don 't like being called that . 
Just a joke . 
This press conference , Nico . 
Please , can we not do this right here ? 
Fuck off . Teeing up Carolyn 's murder for political gain . 
Hey . Raymond , let 's not do this right now . 
- Fuck you too , Tommy . - This is beneath us . 
- Just shut the fuck up . - This is beneath us . Nothing 's beneath me . I once fucked an ottoman . 
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of broken heart , who are pressed and bored down with afflictions , by the sorrow of heart under which their spirits are broken or with a sense of sin and sorrow for it by which their hearts smite them ... - Her ex . - and they are wounded by it ... - You ever meet him ? 
- No . - and broken with it . - Fucking weirdo . These are just words . He has an alibi . 
- Carolyn Polhemus was flesh and blood ... - Who 's the kid next to him ? 
- beloved daughter ... - Her son . mother , public servant . You didn 't know ? 
Words cannot convey the loss or ease our grief . 
We tell ourselves we keep her in our hearts and our minds . 
- Sorry , Raymond , I 'm just gonna ... - Yeah . Ash would not be just ash . Her dust will not be just dust . 
Her memory will fill us . 
It just seems strange that she would never mention that she had a kid . 
And the ex has custody ? 
I 'm assuming he does . Yeah . 
Listen , please tell me that we have some kind of a lead on this , and that we are not absolutely out to fucking sea . 
I have an idea . 
- Okay . - Bunny Davis . 
Reynolds ? We convicted that guy . 
Yeah , but Carolyn and I worked that case together . 
So you 're saying that we put an innocent man behind bars only to have the real killer kill one of our prosecutors ? Great . That 'll get me fucking reelected . 
The two of them were tied up in exactly the same way . 
Do you really think there 's a connection ? 
You asked if we were out at sea . 
Dad ? 
How come you 're home ? 
I was at Carolyn 's memorial . 
You wanna try some ? 
Come on . Let 's see the curveball . Come on . 
Show me the curveball . 
Again . Let 's see it again . 
Blunt force trauma to the head . That 's the official cause of death . 
Read the report . I sent it over . I did . There 's no chemistry , pathology , toxicology . Wasn 't very thorough . 
Wow . Go fuck yourself . 
I am a medical doctor , and you will give me your respect while you 're in this room . 
No wounds that would imply that she was stabbed . 
- No , she wasn 't stabbed . - And no signs of sexual assault . 
No , and you 'd know that if you 'd read the report all the way through . I swear to God , you fucking people . 
Excuse me ? 
I said " you , " and I said " fucking , " and I said " people . " 
I need to go finish my lunch , so ... It was great seeing ya , Sabich . Enjoy the sights . 
Liam Reynolds has been watching Bunny Davis . 
He knows that a $ 12 baggie of heroin can get him anything he wants , so he tricks her into his motel room . And over the course of that week , he keeps her high . 
So high that he has to give her Narcan on three different occasions to revive her . 
Bunny Davis dies three times while she 's with Reynolds . And he revives her three times . 
She 's too drugged to resist , but not so drugged she can 't feel it . 
And when he runs out of drugs and can no longer sedate her , he hog-ties her for three days . 
Three days with a rope around your neck , pulling you , choking you . 
Bunny Davis was a daughter ... a sister ... a friend . 
Bunny Davis was 26 years old when she found herself hog-tied in a dirty motel with a monster , and she is praying ... pleading ... that this is the kind of man who will just let her go . 
But no . 
This man , Liam Reynolds , is the kind of man who does this ... and this ... and this . 
You remember Bunny Davis ? Yeah . 
Carolyn was tied up in a similar way . 
All right . Well , you think there 's a connection ? 
Apparently , Rusty thinks there 's one . 
Yeah , but Liam Reynolds is in prison . 
- Yeah . - All right . Well , you know , it 's not our case . Not yet . 
I don 't think this is our guy . 
It 's totally plausible that he could have gotten someone on the outside to do it . 
That 's a stretch . 
Different MO . The other victim was stabbed in the heart . 
Carolyn was bludgeoned . 
It was a fire poker , by the way . 
Really ? 
Yeah , she had a whole wrought-iron fireplace set . 
Poker 's missing . It would match the wounds . 
- Really ? 
- You 're good . 
Makes me think it just happened . It wasn 't planned . 
It just happened ? It was meticulous . 
No , she was tied up meticulous . Not so much the murder . 
Sounds like something I 'd do . 
Sounds like something I 'd enjoy . 
So , am I a suspect ? 
I mean , hope so . It 's pretty fucking boring around here . 
Will I get to go back to court , put on a tie , dress up ? 
What , are you looking for some kind of revelation ? 
Fuck off . 
She was about notches on her belt , which I was one . 
So , if you want a statement from me , I got a statement for you . " Yippee . " 
Or no , here 's a better one . 
Here 's a better one from me . " What goes around comes around . " Are you done ? 
I 'd gladly crater her skull . 
You 're a thoughtful guy , yeah ? 
So , let 's just say , for the sake of argument ... yours , not mine ... you 're a thoughtful guy serving a life sentence . 
Not Carolyn 's doing , by the way . 
And that if you had any information at all , I think you might find it advantageous that you 're sitting across from the chief deputy prosecutor . 
What do you wanna do ? You wanna go keep doing whatever it is that you 're doing around here ? 
Let me ask you something . Do you actually think that I had something to do with the death of your revered colleague ? 
I think that you would be intrigued by the commonalities between Bunny and her . 
And that if you had anything to share at all , now might be an opportune time . 
Carolyn Polhemus . ruined my life . 
You helped . 
We , the jury in the above-titled case , find the defendant , Liam Reynolds , guilty of murder in the first degree . Yes ! 
There 's two things that I never forget . 
Faces , and being fucked over ! 
As beloved as Carolyn was , she also made a lot of enemies . She was an unflinching prosecutor who put a lot of very bad people in prison . Some possibly looking to get even . 
It 's every prosecutor 's worst fantasy that someone you convict comes looking for revenge . 
Violent criminals with grudges is not something you want to cultivate . 
Things aren 't okay the way they are . There 's a lot of fear . 
People don 't feel safe , and people are anxious . And they 've got good reason to be , because Raymond Horgan is not doing a good-enough job of keeping things safe , and that 's something that we intend to change . 
And right now , people don 't feel free and they don 't feel safe . 
So , in two weeks , Chicago , get out there and vote . 
Mr. Caldwell , I 'm sorry for just turning up like this . 
- My name is Rusty Sabich . - I know who you are . 
Carolyn spoke of you . 
I tried calling . 
Police have already been here . 
Could I just have a word with you ? 
We divorced over nine years ago . We haven 't really kept in close touch . 
And do you know anything about her personal life ? I do not . Do you ? 
Her life was work , so the people at her work would be in a much better position to know . 
Really , the reason we divorced . 
You worked quite closely with her , from what I understand . 
She was my number two . 
I never knew that she had a child . 
Yeah , sometimes what you don 't know can tell you everything . 
Carolyn was a very compartmentalized person . 
I 'm sure there are many things about her that remain unknown to me . 
Whatever I did see and know is what she wanted seen and known . 
If you 're wondering whether I killed her , the police have already satisfied themselves that I didn 't . 
My son , Michael . 
Mr. Sabich . 
Hello , Michael . I 'm sorry for your loss . 
Thank you . 
He 's angry ... at the world , at his mother , at me . 
His family unit failed . 
I 'm sure he blames me for that failure . 
Okay , everyone . Let 's get started . 
Listen , I know that we 're all struggling . 
We 're going through some very hard times . 
Carolyn was a really special person , one of our core team . 
Look , it 's okay to hurt . 
And it 's okay if you can 't carry on . 
That 's human nature . But it 's also human nature to support each other . You know , to be compassionate . What 's the ... What 's ... 
Sorry . 
What 's the news on that front , Carolyn 's murder ? 
Well , we haven 't gotten the whole full path report . 
On Carolyn 's clothes and body , there were minute fibers of a carpeting that were not found in her apartment . 
They were synthetic , milled domestically . The color is called Scottish malt . The dye lot hasn 't been identified and the fiber could be from either industrial or domestic weave ... 
Color 's called Scottish malt . Narrows it down . 
There was also probably no struggle before she was killed , so no sign of break-in , which suggests that Carolyn knew her killer . 
And the autopsy concludes three blows to the head . 
And what 's this with the rope ? 
It 's just standard half-inch , American-made hemp . 
Right . Which can be found almost anywhere . 
Target , Walgreens , Home Depot . 
So , when you say that this investigation is nowhere , you really mean it . 
Is that what you plan to report to Delay , so you can call a press conference and declare incompetence ? 
Your incompetence is on full parade today . 
Wow , you really can be a real dick , can 't you , Tommy ? 
I guess this ends the compassionate portion of the evening . 
Tommy , can I talk to you ? 
What the fuck was that , Tommy ? - What ? - You think that that 's productive ? 
I wasn 't aware that 's what we were going for . - You know what ? - I know a lot . 
Uh-uh . You know what , I 'm tired of your fucking insubordination , okay ? 
And if I find that you have been blocking my investigation , I ... Blocking ... You have carpet fibers . 
The case is basically solved . 
Are you fucking kidding me ? 
You wanna take me on ? You wanna take me on ? 
- No . - You think that would be a good idea ? 
How do you think that 'll work out for you , Tommy ? 
You 're upset . 
Mr. Sabich , any comments on the Polhemus case ? 
I 'm not at liberty to comment right now . This is an ongoing investigation , - but I can tell you that this office ... - Way to go , Rusty . Come on . is hard at work , and Raymond Horgan is very hard at work . 
And the idea that we 're doing nothing is offensive . 
I mean , I understand that that 's an idea that Nico Della Guardia wants to convey because it 's politically advantageous for him to stoke fear . But Nico Della Guardia hasn 't tried an actual case in this courtroom for years . 
- He pleads everything out . - Get ' em ! His methodology of choice is to just stall and stall and stall until the defendant 's lawyers have to quit ' cause their clients can 't pay them anymore . 
It 's one thing to be a hack . It 's another thing to be dishonorable . But to be both is ... Nico Della Guardia is known around here as Nico " Delay " Guardia because he stalls and he pleads out . And just one last thing . Just one last thing . 
If you were headed down a dark alley and danger lay ahead , who would you want in your corner ? 
A pleader and a staller ... - That little fuck . - like Nico Della Guardia , or a fighter like Raymond Horgan ? 
Please don 't tell me you 're personally handling Carolyn 's case . Right ? 
Raymond asked me to . 
Raymond asked you to . 
If I don 't take it , then it falls to Tommy Molto , who will do nothing because this going unsolved dooms Raymond 's chances of reelection . 
I mean , should Della Guardia win , then he 'll give Tommy my job , by the way . 
And what if it gets out ... That you two were involved . 
I mean , what 's that gonna do to your case , your career and our kids ? 
Me ? 
It has been over for so long between me and Carolyn . 
I just need two weeks , because between now and the primary , Raymond needs there to be a case , Barbara . 
And I am the only one in the position to deliver that . 
What , he can 't find a prosecutor who hasn 't slept with her ? 
I 'm sorry . 
Our marriage barely survived this . 
I barely survived this . 
I know you , Rusty . 
You will disappear into this case . 
You will disappear and you will go silent . 
And that 'll break me . 
My father cheated on my mother ... and ... I swore to myself that I would never do that . 
And now I 'm here . 
Why do you think it happened ? 
I don 't know . You know , it wasn 't about the sex . 
I mean , it became about that . But I mean , with Barbara , that 's what it was at first . 
I mean , B and I met when we were 20 . 
She was pregnant six months later , and then there was Jaden and then there was Kyle . 
And so we were just ... we were in . 
When we laid down to bed , you know , we lay with all of our worries . You know , the kids ' troubles at school , my caseload . 
With Carolyn , it was just pure . 
She just woke me up , you know ? 
She was funny and strong , and she was brilliant , Carolyn . 
Just fucking brilliant . 
You know what I can 't make sense of , and maybe you can help me understand ? 
There was something about that first encounter ... I just keep thinking about . I mean , maybe what she was drawn to wasn 't just me . 
Meaning ? 
Do you think she was drawn to your power ? 
Well , that doesn 't sound very loving . 
But it was . 
I 'm trying to teach you something . - You 're not listening . - I 'm trying to learn . - You 're not listening . - I 'm half listening . 
Kind of miss the old days , where , if two consenting adults wanted to touch each other , they could just touch . 
We were very physical . 
She was very aggressive . 
She liked it when I was aggressive . 
You 're talking about the sex now ? 
And sometimes when Carolyn and I would engage in ways that B and I never did , Carolyn would look at me and she would say , " Does Barbara do this for you ? " 
Almost like she wanted to bring her into the bed with us . Like she wanted her to be in bed with us . Like she wanted one more witness to what I was willing to lose . 
Is that a sentiment that you 've shared with Barbara ? 
Don 't . 
Does Barbara do this for you ? 
I can 't stop thinking about her . 
Della Guardia . 
Thank you . What ... What a wonderful night . 
But look , let 's remember , friends , only the beginning . 
I would also like to thank my wonderful friend and noble adversary , Raymond Horgan . 
Thank you ... No . He has served this city so faithfully for so long . 
- My dear friend Raymond . - My heart and love go out to him . So , Raymond Horgan , thank you , please . Yeah . But you know , look , that 's the past and we 're here for the ... Future ! Does this mean you 're out tonight ? 
I mean , I still have a job , but I 'm not chief deputy prosecutor . 
That 's Tommy , right ? Yes . It 's Tommy Molto . 
are you with me ? - Fuck ' em . - Okay , yeah . 
- Kyle . - Fuck them . 
Honestly , I mean , look at ' em . 
I mean , he 's not wrong . 
You wouldn 't wanna be there with these guys in charge . 
Okay . Well , where would I go ? 
What would I do ? 
What about the case ? 
I don 't know . 
How 'd it go with Dr. Rush ? 
You would have liked it . 
She completely took your side . Of course she did . I 'm the " cuckoldee . " 
I am sorry about the election ... and your job . 
I 'm almost relieved , you know ? 
Thank you for sticking by me . 
It 's not lost on me that I 'm , you know ... 
The stickiest ? 
You know , I 'm not tragically dependent . 
I could have left . I could have moved on . I still could . 
The reason I haven 't is we have a family ... and if I 'm desperate for anything , it 's to preserve that . 
And I love you . 
There 's that . 
I will fight ... You and I will fight ... to save what we have because we have got a lot . 
But you need to stop loving her . 
You need to stop loving her . 
I called Nico . Congratulated him on both his victory and a race well-fought . 
I also told him that I would be stepping down immediately , as it will allow him to enjoy a bit of incumbency before the general election . 
Add to that , a lame-duck prosecutor really can 't serve the best interests of our city . 
Rigo , hey . Hey , how you doing ? 
- I don 't know . - Yeah . Well , sorry . 
What are you doing here ? 
Hall and Oates want a debrief on some cases . Some cases ? 
Hey , you gonna hang in okay ? 
- Always . - See ya . 
Wow , couldn 't get out of here fast enough , huh ? 
Yeah . Well , if you believe the press , I don 't really have that much time here . 
It 's like a champion stud going out to pasture . 
If only the stud part still worked . 
You ready ? 
What , for pasture ? 
No , for this meeting . 
With Tweedledum and Tweedledumber . 
You 've seen the look on my face . Please . Come on , Raymond . Take a seat . 
You too , Rusty . And close the door . 
First off , I just wanna thank you for your gracious remarks last night . 
They were very moving , very kind . Fuck off . 
Your previous public comments , however , saddened me . 
Sorry you feel that way . 
So , Tommy 's gonna assume the role of chief deputy prosecutor , effective immediately . 
It goes without saying , you 'll just pass on your case list and charging notes and calendar files , and blah-blah-blah . 
And then given the compounding public interest in the Carolyn Polhemus case ... The fire you flamed like a shameless fuck ? 
Where are we on that ? 
I mean , I gave Tommy the full report . 
Actually , I don 't think you did . There 's a couple things are missing here . 
Like what ? 
The fingerprint analysis , for starters . I 'm still waiting on that . 
It 's available . 
So you have been tampering ? 
Well , I mean , it 's my investigation now . 
Several sets of fingerprints were found in her apartment , including yours . 
So , when was the last time you were in Carolyn 's apartment ? 
I was at the scene following her death . 
But you were gloved up , right ? 
And your fingerprints were found in her bedroom . No one saw you enter that room . So , when was the last time you were in Carolyn 's apartment prior to the murder ? 
We had cases together ... trials ... and sometimes we would work after hours , and sometimes we would be at her apartment . 
So you discussed cases at her apartment ? We were work colleagues . 
So , I looked at Carolyn 's call logs on her cell phone . 
- You two had quite a few calls together . - What is the point of this ? 
The point is , I 'm trying to find out when the last time you were in Carolyn 's apartment prior to the murder . And you said that you worked on cases together there . 
Do I need a lawyer present at this meeting ? 
What was the last case the two of you worked on together ? 
I 'm sorry , am I under criminal investigation here ? 
Listen , I 'm the new chief deputy prosecutor . I 'm looking to be briefed by the former chief deputy . 
I have questions . It 's normal . 
Were you and Carolyn romantically involved ? 
You want me to repeat the question ? 
My personal relationship with Carolyn Polhemus is not relevant to this investigation . Are you shitting me ? 
- You 're a hack , Tommy . - Hey , Rusty . I certainly stand corrected for having accused you of incompetence in this investigation . 
Seems it was deliberate , bordering on artful . - You 're a fucking hack , Tommy . - Hey , maybe ... You 're a fucking hack . Rusty , maybe you should keep your mouth shut . 
Here 's the thing . Full path report came back on Carolyn 's murder and she was pregnant . 
Were you aware that Carolyn was pregnant at the time of the murder ? 
No . Do you have any idea who the father might be ?
