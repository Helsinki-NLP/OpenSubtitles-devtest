We would like to appeal to anyone that might 've been in the Rowntree Park area on Tuesday afternoon . If you think you might have seen or heard anything , anything at all , please get in contact . Call the helpline . It 's completely confidential . 
- What 's this ? - It 's your mum , okay ? She wanted to see the thing . 
Everybody deserves to feel safe and secure ... - Hi . - Hi . - This could 've been your family . - It 's not the same on my telly . 
This could 've been your child . There is no excuse ... - I thought you hated the police . 
- I love my daughter . 
That 's good to know . 
In any community . - Thank you , DS Lenker . 
- I used to watch all her school plays . 
- Mum in plays ? 
- Well , you know , assembly . 
So embarrassing . What was she like ? Was she good ? Oh , well , she was very clear . Very loud . - You had to stand well back . - Oh , mum . 
Oh , for God 's sake . Oh , for God 's sake . 
Isaac grew up in that park . You know , he loved that park . 
Every day coming back from school , he 'd be tugging at me hand , you know . " Please , Mum . Just five minutes . Just five minutes . " 
So , Nana Mo , what 's your beef with the police ? - Yeah , he was ... - It 's not my ... - Thank you so much . 
- Well , what do you call it ... - It 's your granddad . - We appreciate you taking time ... They hounded him every day of his adult life if you must know . 
Just for the ... You know ... Just for the fun of it . 
- Mum . - What ? He has a right to know . 
- Not today . 
Why don 't I run you home ? Come on . 
You know , the thing about dad , he didn 't go on and on and on about it . 
No , he didn 't , did he ? 
He 'd sit there putting up with it , not making a fuss . 
It made me so mad . 
Why you had to run off and join that lot , - I will never ever comprehend . - I was trying ... You think you can change them . 
You can 't change a bloody thing . 
I can confirm that an individual has been arrested , and I would class this as a significant breakthrough . 
We 're working hand in hand with community leaders , but it is a ... An ongoing operation as we speak . 
Thank you . As you know , Isaac remains in a critical condition . 
Jason . 
We 've got eyewitness testimony of you carrying the weapon . 
We 've got CCTV footage of you discarding the said firearm . 
What I want to know is , how did it come into your possession ? 
Did somebody give it to you ? 
Yeah , he got shot , innit ? 
Jason , I 'd like to suggest you use your right to ... Jason , I 'd like to suggest you use your right to ... The yute got wigged on accident . 
Now , man never meant for him to get caught up in all that . 
Just meant to scare the opps . 
So , you were in a dispute with a rival gang ? 
And if I could go back and change shit , then ... So , you are admitting to the shooting of Isaac Whitlow ? 
Yeah , I am . 
Okay , gather round . 
So I spoke to the lab . 
Isaac 's bullet is a match with Jason 's firearm . 
All right , so what 's our move ? Well ... Not you . 
June . 
- Did you review the interview tape ? - Yes . And ? I think ballistics plus the confession ... We 'll get onto CPS , charge the suspect . Okay . 
You buy it ? The confession ? 
Yeah . I mean , I was convinced , yeah . 
Yeah , but he didn 't need to confess . He just gave it up , easy . 
He 's 17 . He 's a kid . 
Yeah , arrested how many times ? 
- Seven . - Seven . 
Seven times . But not for attempted murder . 
He was as calm as you like . He ran circles around his brief . 
Well , maybe he 's thinking cooperate now ... Get in early . Guilty plea . Go for a softer sentence . 
You bet your life on that ? 
It 's objectively a fair assumption . 
I see what you 're saying . I mean , confession , it 's a silver bullet , right ? 
That 's the gold standard . 
The jury , they won 't think twice . That boy 's done . 
Eighteen , 20 years gone . You 're okay with that ? 
Physical evidence , the weapon . 
It was his weapon . 
Jason Reeve is a member of a gang . 
I mean , you shoot a kid in the park , who in their right mind hangs onto the fucking weapon ? 
Well , he did , evidently . 
He had the gun . He had the gun . But did he fire it , or was he holding onto it for a friend ? 
I mean , he 's belting up Cannon Road , fleeing arrest . He finds time to make a phone call , 34 seconds to an unregistered number no longer in service . You gotta ask yourself , " Who is he calling ? " 
Who 's he calling ? 
Do you know what I see ? 
I see a kid , 17 years old , bribed and threatened into following orders . 
Hello ? I saw her . I know that woman . 
What makes you think the person in the flyer is the same person you met ? 
Did she say what she did for work ? 
- A cleaner , I think . - Do you know whereabouts ? 
No . But she liked it , bettering her English . Then her boyfriend told her to give it up . Boyfriend ? 
Some Englishman . She moved in with him and after that ... - She stopped coming . 
Do you know what her name was , Mrs. Odinaka ? 
Carlita ? Carla ? Carla . Carlita ? Carla ? Carla . 
And you 're sure this is the same woman ? Okay , well ... We had a barbecue here last summer . And ... Here . Here she is . At the back . 
Hello . You 're through to the inquiry team . 
Hi . I 'm calling about the shooting in Rowntree Park . 
You know , the one that was on the TV , that they were talking about ? 
- I saw them shoot that poor kid . - Okay . How many assailants did you see ? 
Two . 
One was a Black lad . He was driving . But the other one , the one that shot him , he was a white guy . 
We 've had a call on the helpline . 
- Jed . 
- Sir ? Your turn on the dentist 's chair . Come on . Okay . 
We know you didn 't fire the gun . But you tell me who did fire the gun , we 'll keep you safe . 
Are you deaf ? 
I said I shot him , didn 't I ? 
We have an eyewitness . 
Like , these men ... they 're ruthless , innit ? Like , came out of nowhere , started sending down orders , plugging us . 
Like , they wanna run ends , and they don 't want no rivals . 
So , this is about turf ? 
The word gets out that we 're still looking for the shooter , rightly or not , they 're gonna leave the blame at your door or your family 's door . 
The witness gave us a partial description . 
What is he ? Armenian ? 
Albanian ? 
Turkish ? 
Turkish . 
Living locally ? Yeah , so we 're just making inquiries into an incident that occurred Wednesday the 28th ? 
Looking for a man of Turkish descent . Thank you . Hi , sir . This is just about the incident in the park with the little boy that happened . 
Any information at all would really help . 
- Hi . Yeah , do you ... - What is it ? 
Hello , sir . This is just about the incident that happened in the park . 
We 're trying to find a boy . He may be of Turkish descent . No . What 's going on ? - Why are you here ? - I 'm here to help . Always the police come here . We 're just here collecting as much information as we can . You always come here . - You harass us . Why ? - Step back . No , we 're not . We 're not attacking you . I 'm gonna need you to just calm down . Over here , please . - Relax . Move away . - Hey ! If you have any questions , please do let us know , okay ? 
Thank you for your cooperation . 
- You okay ? - Yeah . - Sure ? - Yeah . 
Do you remember Dan McCabe out in Eltham ? 
Now , he put in 17 years of service . And they 've gone and sacked him , all because of a couple of , I don 't know , lively messages . 
Look , Kim , this is totally irrelevant . I 've got other things to do . 
I don 't need to be talking about fucking Dan in fucking Wrexham or wherever it was . 
I tell you what , I 'm counting the days , mate . 
World 's gone mad . 
Kim , I 'm waiting for a phone call here . 
And what about all that bollocks at the press conference ? With your pal , Meghan Markle . 
- Who ? - June Lenker . 
Look , I get it . I do . She fits the optics . I 'm not having a go . 
I told ' em that would be her nibs Claudia Mayhew and the bleeding heart brigade . 
Listen , I need all the help I can get , right ? 
But what is she doing ? 
What does she want ? 
Who cares ? Who cares what she wants ? Listen , okay ? This is it . This is the world we live in . Get used to it , all right ? 
And stop worrying about Errol Mathis . It 's sorted . And stop worrying about Errol Mathis . It 's sorted . Ancient history . Get off my back . I was having a fucking rare good day until now . 
You lot always come to me whenever anything happens around here , like I 'm the voice of the streets or something . 
Okay , Hasad . How many times you been arrested ? 
That 's not the point . 
All I 'm saying is , just please call me if you do hear anything . Please . The kid 's nine years old . Shot in the head . 
I 'm not taking that . I 'm not taking it . Look , I don 't know shit about no shooting . And you lot are wasting your time with this anyway , man . 
Some pricks in Downing Street who need arresting . 
Okay , how about I take your number ? Just in case I ever need a voice of the streets . All right . 
Okay . " Hasad " ? 
First fed to spell my name right . Sorry ? 
Well , they usually spell it with two S 's . 
They 're not wrong , but two S 's ain 't how you spell my name . 
Turkish names trip people up a lot . 
Yeah . Thanks . 
- Hi . - Water ? Yeah , thanks . That would be great . 
Listen , Errol 's alibi , the guy at the barbershop ... - Mustafa Demir ? 
- Yeah . Yeah , it 's all up here filed away under " kill me now . " 
- Are you sure he went back to Turkey ? - Yeah . 
- What , you confirmed that ? - Yes . Jesus . 
I spoke to his old boss , checked his last known address , trawled the Internet , la , la , la . Why ? 
This is gonna sound wild , but just go with me here . Turkish names , they trip people up . Turkish names , they trip people up . 
Trip people up how ? 
I just googled the name Mustafa . 
You can spell it , like , seven different ways . Okay ? So , what if the officer wrote down his name with the wrong spelling ? 
What if we 've been looking for the wrong Mustafa ? 
Here . Yours for a tenner . What do you reckon ? 
Yeah . Whatever . 
Listen , I can come with you . 
No , I 've got this . 
Look , I know this is a big day for you . 
You 're all right , tough guy . 
Happy birthday , Mum . 
She was a young girl when she had you . 
I remember when Errol first brought your mum round . I remember when Errol first brought your mum round . 
You came too , so shy and skinny . 
I knew I had to fatten you up with my bammy and escovitch . 
Yeah . Them Scotch bonnets were spicy . 
But your mum could take it . Yeah . 
She 'd be so proud . Yeah , she would . 
To see you now doing so well , looking so tall and handsome . 
No thanks to me . 
- I know I let you down . - It 's okay . 
We tried , love . We tried for adoption but ... It doesn 't matter . 
I couldn 't turn my back on Errol ... stop all contact . ' Cause that 's what they said . Look . 
I 'm sorry . You do see that , don 't you ? I 'm sorry . You do see that , don 't you ? 
Still . You know , I shouldn 't say , but things are finally moving forward in that department . 
What ? What do you mean ? 
There 's a lady we 're looking for , someone called Carla . Yeah ? She 's got new information . 
Information ? 
- What information ? 
- Don 't you worry . But I tell you , we 're getting Errol home soon . 
So , this is them . 
A bit " My Little Pony . " 
Go in , walk tall . No one 's gonna laugh . 
Hey , fuck off , man ! 
Hey , fuck off ... 
Patrick . 
He likes you . 
Yeah . I 'm good with dogs . 
Right , come on . Sit down . 
Over here . Over here . Hey . 
Try that on your eye . 
Head back . Thanks . 
So , how 's the other guy look ? 
The other guy ? 
Come on . Worse , of course . 
- Work okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , it 's fine . 
It was just some guy at my lodgings . 
Anything I can do ? 
Thanks . 
So , what 's up ? 
Feels like it never goes away . 
What happened ? Was somebody bothering you about your mum ? 
Who was it ? 
A police officer ? No . What do you mean ? 
Doris . What fresh hell is she cooking up for you now ? 
I don 't know . 
Some woman they 're looking for who 's got information . Yeah , I know about that . That 's nothing . That 's the wrong end of the stick . Who is she ? 
Nobody . 
You okay ? 
Do you want me to walk you back through it ? 
We entered the flat . A neighbor had called 999 . 
They 'd had a big fight . 
Errol and your mum , shouting and ... screaming . 
I saw your mum ... in the kitchen . 
Do you remember the car accident ? 
Right . Well , you were in bad shape with your legs . Errol was ... Errol , he was okay . 
He had blood on him . But it was her blood . Okay ? 
Not his . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? 
What are we doing , Mostapha ? Yeah . My VIP , he decides . Okay . 
Right . Do you wanna carry on ? 
They 'd been having some trouble at home . 
Money , job , you know . People lose their rag . Well , you know that , right ? 
But Errol , he denied it , of course . 
He even had an alibi . 
Oh , yeah . But we found the man . 
We traced him . We talked to him . And he said no . We traced him . We talked to him . And he said no . Errol ... He never saw Errol . This is it . I 'm in London . 
- You 're living the dream . 
- Yes , my friend . Life is good . 
He just made it up , you see ? 
The neighbors , the fight , the blood , the postmortem . 
I don 't ... You don 't need to know any of that . 
In the end , it was overwhelming . The fight just went out of him . 
He confessed . 
He confessed all of it , the whole thing . And , you know people , they can say whatever they like , but I was there . Those are the facts . 
God , I had a job finding you . 
Your old boss seemed to think that you 'd moved to Istanbul . 
Got some questions about an old case from a few years back . Errol Mathis ? 
Apparently , you were unable to provide an alibi . 
Errol claimed that at the time his girlfriend was murdered , he was actually in your barbershop inquiring about work . 
People used to come in all the time . 
So someone did come in , then ? 
Look , I don 't want no trouble . 
Yeah , sure . It 's just there 's a man sat in jail for a crime I don 't think he committed . 
So , were you lying ? Were you threatened ? 
Mostapha , something you wanna tell me ? 
It was ... The police asked me to identify him from the pictures . The police asked me to identify him from the pictures . 
Yeah , and ? 
- The pictures ? 
- The faces . To me they all look the same . 
I 'm not racist . I swear . 
You couldn 't tell them apart . 
They showed you a load of Black faces . You picked the wrong man . 
You know , when I saw him on TV ... When I saw Errol , I thought , " Was that him ? Was that the man I saw ? " So why didn 't you go back , say you made a mistake ? Come on . You know the detectives down in Hackney Downs . 
Coppers with friends in these far-right groups . Fascist people , combat league . 
- Yeah , but you could 've ... - Listen . 
People see , people talk . 
I didn 't want no trouble . Okay . 
Stupid . 
Tell him ... I 'm so sorry for everything . Yeah . 
And you 're sure he 's our Mostapha ? 
- He didn 't deny it . 
- Unbelievable . 
I think he was relieved , on some level , to finally get it off his chest . 
Do you think he 'd be willing to revise his statement ? Confirm it was Errol he saw ? I don 't know . Maybe ? But , Sonya , come on . Tell me . Twelve years down the line , is that really gonna move the needle with an appeals panel ? 
Listen though , you know , a man just looked me in the eye and told me that he doesn 't think that Errol was there in that flat . He 's innocent , yeah ? So ... He 's innocent , yeah ? So ... 
Wait a minute . That 's my car . 
You okay ? 
How long is he gonna be here ? 
24-7 , to make sure you finish your homework . 
Hilarious . 
Not a word to Nana Mo though , okay ? You know what she 's like . Not a word to Nana Mo though , okay ? You know what she 's like . Still , I mean , 24-hour protection 's pretty cool . 
No , it 's ridiculous actually . It 's a total waste of money . 
Oh , my God . 
Don 't move . Both of you . 
Don 't stress . Just ... You didn 't have to come . 
I 'm sorry about all this , but it was my decision . 
Well , we don 't need it . 
If there 's someone out there making targeted threats , trying to warn you off of , you know , going after Isaac 's shooter , God forbid they get a hold of your address . 
My fault . I should never have put you in front of the cameras . 
We 're gonna have to stand you down from the investigation . 
Why ? 
There 's been some activity online . Some act ... What ? Gang stuff . Showing off what they 'll do next , you know ? 
We 're trying to get it taken down but it 's not a walk in the park . 
It 's pretty standard fare . Just don 't look , all right ? It 's nothing to worry about . 
Okay . Thanks . 
- Hurry up . 
I wanna help you , Jason . 
I wanna protect you . 
Will you let me do that ? 
Just give me the name . 
- Sir ? 
- June . Can you give us a shout as soon as you get in , please ? 
It 's a matter of some urgency , I 'm afraid . 
Look , is this about the log sheets ? Because I filled them in . 
That 's still under review . But I do have a duty to inform you that a new complaint has been made against you . 
Sorry , what ? 
It 's an allegation of workplace bullying . 
June . I know , it 's a lot to take in . 
Yeah , I 'm not gonna argue with that . 
I 've got to be fair to all parties . 
- What parties ? - You know I can 't get into that . 
Right . 
Right . Sorry , sir . It 's just another thing , you know ? 
I know . 
You know , he had me taken off the investigation . Do you know that ? 
" He " being ? 
Yes , I 'm aware . 
My car , torched . 
- I know . And we are all here for you . 
Well , it 's a bit convenient , isn 't it ? June . Sir , how did that guy know where I was parked ? 
I know how this sounds . I know this sounds a bit mad . - But our vehicles , they 're all tracked . 
- Oh , for crying out loud . 
Hegarty makes a call . He pulls in a favor . - Come on . 
- And then now , today , I 'm a bully ? - Come on . - And then now , today , I 'm a bully ? 
I mean , come on . You 've got to admit - the timing is perfect . 
- Stop . 
Tell me something . Have you ever heard of a man named Amit Ã  eker ? No ? Twenty-eight years old , Turkish descent . 
Well , back here on planet Earth , as of , I don 't know , about two hours ago , a man of that name was picked up on suspicion of the shooting of your victim . Your lad , Isaac Whitlow . 
Yeah . Hegarty was fed a name . 
The team worked literally through the night . 
Model policing . Tracing the fellow to a trap house off the old Kemp Road . 
And is it him ? The shooter . Yeah . Well , how do they know ? 
It 's all there . Physical evidence , sworn testimony . 
Lawyer 's trying to cut a deal , but Hegarty 's having none of it ' cause he 's pushing for attempted murder . 
Good . Good . Good . 
Jenny , Isaac 's mum , she 'll be ... Wish I 'd been there . 
I know . 
Look , take a steer from your old boss . Let it go . 
Because despite appearances , Dan is one of the good ones . And not without a friend or two . So there 's that . 
Hey . We had some leftovers at work , so ... 
- What , you made this ? - Yeah . 
- Listen ... - It 's lasagna . To say thank you or whatever . 
Patrick , you can 't keep showing up like this . 
Listen , you can 't , okay ? 
This is my daughter , Lisa . Patrick . 
Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . 
Why don 't we see if we can try and get you out of those lodgings , yeah ? 
- Lisa . 
- One second . 
Look . It was me . 
What ? 
I never said you were bullying me . 
I never used that word . But I had Roy all over me . 
Blah , blah , blah , " Did you give her the path report ? " 
- The path report . - Yes . 
For Maria De Souza . Clive Silcox case . But they were all over me for leaking it , and I was ... I was trying to explain . 
I mean , let 's be honest here , you were pretty demanding . I mean , let 's be honest here , you were pretty demanding . Yeah , but I didn 't bully you . I mean , Jesus , Chloe . 
I 'm sorry . 
But listen , if Roy 's gone all nuclear and ... And escalated everything , that 's on him . That 's ... 
It 's not me . - No . I trusted you . I mean , what the fuck ? - It 's ... 
What ? 
Sorry , what 's that ? 
We 're not all as Teflon as you . - What ? 
- You and your new friends . - Greasing the ladder . - I 'm sorry . I ... 
No , no , no , you know damn well . That press conference ? I get it , I do . Black , yeah , but not too Black . 
- What ? - Yeah , not too threatening . 
- Fuck you , seriously . 
- I mean , fair play . I couldn 't do it . 
It 's like they say , it 's all a game , right ? You know , just don 't expect anyone to like you for it . 
Seriously ! Do you know what ... Actually , you should see what they call you in the group chat . 
Just enjoy your coffee . 
Hello ? 
Hi , June . It 's Becca here , from Moore Street Shelter . 
- Sorry , are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . How can I help ? 
Did you ask a colleague to call up about someone called Carla ? 
Sonya . 
June . What 's up ? 
Did anyone start calling up shelters ? For our misper . 
No , we were waiting for you to send the list over . Why ? Right . Yeah , it 's just I just had a call from one of the refuges in Leyton . 
They had a male police officer call up looking for anyone on the register that might have been sheltered under the name of Carla . 
Sorry . Someone else is looking for Carla ? 
Well , the officer didn 't give his name . Which is weird in itself . That 's why they called me . 
I mean , am I missing something ? 
Did you tell anyone we were looking for her ? No . 
Well , somebody said something . If not us , then who ? Doris ? 
Or one of her little helpers . 
Marcia . 
Joe ? 
Latisha ? 
So , Tony Gilfoyle . He arrested you for shoplifting , and then he dropped the charges . 
In exchange for what ? 
- I tell him stuff . 
- Stuff ? You were reporting on Doris ? Spying on the campaign ? Not spying . I just said how we were getting on , that 's all . 
How long ? 
How long have you been doing this for ? 
Eight years . 
- Eight . - But I only said good things . I never said anything bad . 
She 's been so good to me . She helped me with my kids . 
I could have lost them with my record . But she didn 't judge . 
She did everything to make sure I could carry on being a mum . Jesus Christ . 
Right , so what was the agreement with Gilfoyle ? Was he paying you ? 
No . He got me on a list , that 's all . - List ? - For a flat . 
Okay . So , you 've told him about Carla , obviously ? 
- Yeah . 
- And what about me ? 
Did you tell him that I was helping you out ? 
All right , you 're gonna call Doris tonight ... - No . I can 't . - And you 're gonna tell her , sick aunt , new job . 
Tell her the truth . I don 't care . 
You stay away from her , and you do it tonight . 
What do I say to Tony ? 
You can say what you like . 
Chances are he knows already . 
Latisha . Hello , love . Sorry . Are you busy ? No . How can I help ? Okay . Well , I wanna talk to you about ... I 'm so sorry , Doris . 
Look , I 'm sorry about all this , boss , okay ? Look , I 'm sorry about all this , boss , okay ? I 'll see you tomorrow , all right ? Ta , mate . 
The thing about Tony , all right , the job is his life . 
He 's ten years into multiple sclerosis . I 've got him on school visits and disability protocols . 
Good luck telling that to the IOPC . 
He 's harmless . Really ? Harmless ? 
Eight years running covert ops on a defenseless woman . 
Is that normal for you ? You and your old boys . 
Listen , they were planning an appeal . We wanted to know what they were going with , that 's it . 
You have no idea of the damage . - Damage ? - Yeah . Damage . 
Let me ask you , do your new friends know about certain claims made on that emergency call ? 
Well , just so I 'm clear , if I found out you shared it , any part of it , then I won 't hold back . If I found out you shared it , any part of it , then I won 't hold back . 
You will need every friend that you 've got . I will fucking have you . 
All good ? 
" Harmless . " That was what he called it . " Harmless . " 
It 's like nobody matters . 
Not people like Doris anyway . 
I 'm sorry , I 'm j ... I 'm going on and ... No , you 're right . I 'm just ... Okay , so what do we do ? Right . 
Right , I mean do you wanna blow the whistle on these arseholes ? 
Because I mean , if that is what you wanna do , then that 's fine . I 'm in . 
I 'm serious . Right . If this is the medicine they need , then ... We 're already under house arrest . I mean , what else can they do to us ? 
It 's up to you . Make the call . 
I tell you what , call that boss lady off the telly . The redhead . What 's her name ? Claudia . 
" The redhead off the telly . " Should I be worried ? 
Just make the call . 
Okay , fine . So I make the call . They log a complaint . It goes on for months and months and months , on and on , and then what ? 
You should 've heard him on the phone . Hegarty . He was nasty , but he was rattled . 
Why ? 
What is he hiding ? 
What exactly did they do to that poor woman 's son ? 
- It 's Sonya . I should go . - Okay . 
I think what I 'm trying to say is ... You need to keep pushing . 
Are you sure ? 
Course , whatever you need . 
Thank you . 
So ... So ... What now ? 
I should get that . 
Hello , can I help you ? 
Stop looking . 
Sorry , who is this ? 
You don 't know what you 're messing with . Carla ? 
How do you know my fucking name ? 
Carla , where are you ? 
Please , stop . 
I promise we can help you . 
No ! Just forget me . 
Forget who I am . ' Cause you 're gonna get me killed . Forget who I am . ' Cause you 're gonna get me killed . 
No . We can keep you safe . 
You don 't believe me . He 's done this before . He will do it again . We believe you . You just need to tell us his name . 
No goddamn names ! 
Do you understand ? He 's protegido . 
Protected . 
How ? 
Who 's protecting him ? 
- Carla ? 
- Just stop .
