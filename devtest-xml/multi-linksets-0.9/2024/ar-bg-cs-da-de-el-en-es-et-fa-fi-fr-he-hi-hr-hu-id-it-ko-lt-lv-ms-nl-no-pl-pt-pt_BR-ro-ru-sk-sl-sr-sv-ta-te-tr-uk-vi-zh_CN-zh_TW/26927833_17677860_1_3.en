Who is this ? Who is this ? Are you gonna answer me ? Who the fuck is this ? Fuck . 
What the fuck ? 
Rusty , who was that ? 
Saw you where ? 
I 'm assuming that they mean Carolyn 's house ... the night of ... 
I wasn 't there to kill her . 
Rusty , this is not you . 
- Rusty , this is not you . - You don 't fucking know me . 
You don 't know me . And you don 't know what 's in me ! 
Wake up , Raymond ! 
You think he 's guilty . - It was a dream , Lo . 
You dreamt he 's guilty , which can mean something . 
Dreams often point to the truth . 
Hey . You know , you being on my side would be nice . 
- Maybe we can try that ? - You think I am not on your side ? 
Raymond , I am worried about you . 
The glare that comes with this kind of case , the pressure . 
Listen , I understand your thirst for relevance , your need to get out of bed in the morning and have something to do to stave off ... 
- What is it you call it ? 
- My decomposing rot . 
Yes , your decomposing rot . 
With your best friend as the defendant . 
Honey ... should you lose , a good chance from what I see and read , 
Maybe you can live with it just fine , but I doubt it . 
Then , there 's the alternative . 
You win . 
Rusty didn 't do this . 
Rusty Sabich , the only suspect in the grisly murder of Carolyn Polhemus , is currently out on bail and isolating with his family in their home . 
There 's human trash outside . 
- Don 't they have actual news to report ? 
- We are actual news . 
People love true crime . It 's a ratings thing . 
- Thank you . - Here you go , sweetie . 
So you have no idea who sent it ? It could very easily be a trick , or it could be some ... semi-clever reporter . 
So this individual knew that you were there the night of ? 
' Cause I didn 't . 
I went there after work . 
So the two of you weren 't quite as over as you led me and others to believe . No ... We were over . I went over there to try and change that . 
And did you ? No . 
Lorraine , hi ... I think you should just hand it over to the police . 
Hold on . Don 't you wanna know what this is about ? 
Who ? 
It could also just blow up in our face . 
- What about Rigo ? Can 't she take it ? - No , no , no . I 've asked her to do too much already . I can 't ask her . If you do this , you have to assume that the person you 're meeting is gonna be wearing a wire . 
So whatever you say , I strongly suggest that you ... You keep it simple , clean . Watch your words . 
Definitely don 't say that you hit Carolyn on the head with a poker . 
I 'm gonna take on an associate , someone who 's done defense before . 
She 's young . Her name is Mya Winslow . 
- How do I know her ? - Yale . She 's good . She was at Sandy Stern 's . 
More importantly , she 's a woman , which we need on this . 
She 's gonna run point on forensics , so we also need to assemble that . 
Listen , let 's talk strategy for a minute , okay ? 
If we 're gonna go alibi on this , we need to file on that . Give notice . 
So , you think we might go alibi ? 
And I mean , we don 't know what time of the night she was murdered . 
I mean , maybe we could say that she was killed when I went to the ... Stop . 
Let 's just wait for all the facts to come in ... before you start crafting responses . 
Mrs. Sabich . Barbara , did your husband commit this murder ? 
- You know what this is , right ? 
Why I 'm here on a Tuesday ? 
Yeah , we 're talking about ... the fire marshal for Marty 's thing , right ? 
I need you to take a step back . 
What does that mean ? 
I came in through the same door you did . Kate . It 'll blow over . 
We live in Chicago . There 's , like , a new dead body every 18 seconds . 
You haven 't been well . 
I sold a piece two weeks ago , Kate . 
No . You sold a piece five weeks ago , and Aminata 's pieces sell themselves . 
- Take some time . 
- Are you really doing this ? 
I 'm not firing you , so don 't get heavy . I 'm saying ... take a break ... and take care of yourself . 
- And keep my distance , huh ? - Yeah . And that , yeah . 
Kate , I really need this job . 
I need every distraction I can get right now . 
It 's a distraction that doesn 't work for us . 
Take some time . 
Word of advice ? 
- Why not . 
- Differentiate . 
You 're not " we . " You 're not " him . " 
Sam Malone used to cut lemons . What was that ? 
Sam Malone from Cheers . 
Cut lemons all the time . Always cutting lemons . 
You 're probably too young to remember Cheers . 
I know Cheers . I love Cheers . Ted Danson . Why do you think I 'm cutting these lemons ? Gold star . 
- You okay ? - Not really . I just lost my job . Shit . Sorry to hear that . 
And my husband 's on trial for murder . 
Murdering his mistress , no less . 
Oh , shit . Yeah . 
What 's his fucking name ... Ronnie ? Ricky ? 
Rusty . Wow . Yeah , you 're going through a lot . 
Yes , I am . 
Did he ? Kill his mistress ? 
Jesus . You don 't have to answer that . I 'm ... 
- That was out of line . 
Sorry . - Not really . 
It 's the question everyone 's asking . 
What 's your answer ? 
He did not do it . 
Beautiful women tend to have a lot of enemies . 
You must have a few yourself . 
- I see what you did there . - Yeah . 
Thank you . 
Would you like another ? 
I better not . Okay . 
He 's cute . 
He is handsome , yes . 
But , I don 't know , I like talking to him . 
He made you smile . 
Maybe you should have a little adventure . 
Please . 
And with the media following my every move ? 
They 're stalking me . 
Oh , honey , they 've already moved on . They 've got their footage , and they 're on to the next dead thing . 
It 's a perk of living in Chicago . I don 't know . 
It 's good to see you smile . 
You 're young , you 're beautiful . You should feel that way every day . 
You are under so much pressure . 
Are you seriously suggesting I engage in a little ... extramarital revenge sex with a bartender I just met ? 
I am suggesting that you tend to yourself . 
An escape hatch of some sort to help you get to the other side of this . 
I mean , not now . I get it , with everything going on . But at some point . 
I admire your fight , your commitment to be in love , to stay in love with the man you married . 
Rusty isn 't the man you married . Let 's face that . 
I directly told you to stand down , Detective . 
- And I have . 
- Bullshit . You and Rusty went to visit Liam Reynolds in prison . 
That was on my own personal time . 
You think this is funny ? 
Why would I waste funny on somebody with no sense of humor ? 
- You know what is funny ? - What ? 
Fucking hilarious , actually , is that you 're not looking at Reynolds for this . 
Carolyn was tied up like Bunny Davis , details not in the public domain ... Liam Reynolds is incarcerated . 
So the fuck what ? He threatened her . He had a motive , and you won 't give it so much as a look-see . 
- Listen , Detective ... - Or , what ? You 'll fire me ? 
Two weeks into your new job ? I think not . Have the whole union up your ass . Or maybe not . I keep forgetting that you 're popular . 
Detective Rodriguez , I 'll walk you out . 
If I may , you are off this case . You will not impede it , you will not obstruct it . And I play poker with your union boss , by the way . 
Terrible fucking poker player . 
You guys just want it to be Rusty so bad , don 't you ? 
Our only pursuit is justice . 
Just be sure you do not stand in that path . 
Thank you . 
Hey . Can you do me a favor ? 
Michael , you asked me to come here . What do you want ? 
Why did you kill her ? 
I didn 't kill her . 
I had a relationship with her , and I will tell you anything that you wanna know about that . 
Michael , I wanna find out who killed her just as much as you do . 
Yeah , well , that 's funny . ' Cause I have pictures of you . 
You have what ? 
I have pictures and videos of you on the night she died . 
- Where ? 
- Her house ! 
Michael , you have photographs of her that night ? 
Answer me . 
You have photographs of that night ? 
You have photographs of other people going in and out of her house ? 
You were literally the only one there . 
Well , I guess , seems like you were there that night too . 
Shut up ! 
Did you think this through ? 
Were you there other nights ? 
If you have photographs , you need to make sure that you give them to me , or you give them to the police . 
I already gave them to the police . I met with the district attorney . 
Then why are we here , Michael ? 
I wanted to see your face . 
See your face ? Why ? 
I don 't buy it . 
I don 't know . It was a very strange conversation , and the kid is very clearly troubled like you said , but ... but look , at least we now have evidence that I wasn 't the only one there . 
- Are you sure he wasn 't wired ? 
- If he was , I was careful . 
Mya Winslow , Rusty Sabich . Hi . I asked Mya to join us for the status conference . 
- We gotta get your appearance filed . 
- Already done . - Excellent . - It 's a pleasure to meet you . Though not under these circumstances . 
You can just observe on this one , nothing to say . You , keep your mouth shut . Not a peep . This is my show . Don 't fuck it up . 
You 're fucking it all up . 
- You 're fucking it all up . 
- Why ? 
That falling-in-love part . That we promised not to . I don 't think that you can control that . 
Some things you can control . 
And I have to be the one to ... to control it . 
Tab one . Evidentiary exhibits . 
Path and lab reports you 'll find behind that in tab two . 
That section is still incomplete but is being updated daily . 
- To be completed when ? - We 're hoping ten days , Your Honor . 
Photography and video exhibits follow in tab three , also to be completed forthwith . We 're still gathering , including street and city cams . 
Medical findings in tab four , and scientific exhibits and analysis behind it in tabs five and six . 
Just hold on a second . - You 've got me down as a witness . - We do . One of the charges is obstruction of justice , Raymond , and Mr. Sabich impeded this investigation . 
In fact , he compromised it , and you have information about that . 
- This is a stunt . - No . 
Sorry . Just very quickly , you took this post as counsel while in possession of information that 's material to the charges . 
- You should 've known better . - Mr. Delay Guardia . 
You 've also got down Dr. Rush , my client 's psychiatrist . 
We anticipate that some of the subject matter might qualify as privileged , and Dr. Rush would be free to claim that exemption should it apply . 
- It will be . - What do you mean , " should it apply " ? You 're gonna ask her to come in , she 's gonna assert privilege , and then he 's gonna paint it like we 're hiding information . 
- We will honor privileged information . - Withholding evidence . Gentlemen , we 're not getting off on a good bunion here . 
We have a case to present . I would submit Your Honor will let us do so . 
When I took this job years ago , I had a mentor . He told me , " Every trial is a bit like a hemorrhoid . " 
Hemorrhoids don 't typically bother me . I can even enjoy them when properly managed . 
I 'm not enjoying myself now . 
This trial will be about evidence and law . What it won 't be about is gamesmanship . Do I make myself perfectly clear ? - Clear . - Well said . Thank you . 
May I also remind the court that the prosecution has a duty to turn over all exculpatory evidence . 
- We 've done so . 
We 've turned over all exculpatory evidence per our duty as officers of the court . So if you had evidence , say , that someone else might have motive to commit this crime ... There 's no such evidence . 
Or you may have evidence , say , that someone else was there that night , maybe someone with a camera taking pictures and videos . 
Mr. Molto ? - Yeah . I got it . - Is that ... We just received photographic evidence that we 're still in the process of authenticating . 
Once that authentication process is complete , we will share it with counsel . 
Who proffered this photographic evidence ? 
The victim 's son . 
May I ask when it was proffered ? 
We are in the process of analyzing it . 
- And any disclosure would be premature . - I see . Hey . 
You are gonna turn over that evidence today , to defense counsel and to me , so we can all properly analyze it together . 
And , Mr. Molto , we are ten weeks from trial . 
If you choose to hide anything else from either defense counsel or this court , I suggest that you not stick it up your ass ' cause that 's the first place I 'm gonna come looking . 
Raymond was in his element . You know , he was on fire . And Tommy was in his element . 
Bet he was . 
The judge granted our motion to access the scene , and that 's not something that the defense usually gets . 
- So a good day then ? - It 's a good start . 
That 's good . Maybe we 'll win , and it 'll be so great that reporters will say , " Rusty Sabich , you just won the Super Bowl of murder trials . What are you gonna do now ? " And you 'll say , " We 're going to Disneyland . " 
I would like to know what evidence they have against you . 
Jaden , not at the table . 
- Yes , Mom . It 's everywhere . - Not at dinner . - It 's on the news , at school . - Not at ... I just wanna know what is what . 
What exactly do they have ? 
It 's circumstantial . Nobody 's gonna be called to the stand to say they saw me kill her because I did not kill her . But I was there that night , and my DNA is all over her apartment , and her DNA is all over my car . 
And they 're gonna say that I was obsessed with her because there are many , many , many texts between me and her . 
Mostly from me in those last few weeks . And obviously , there 's the evidence that she was pregnant with ... And the fact that she was tied up like a ... a prior victim . The killer must have had information that wasn 't available to the public . Carolyn and I were the only two most privy to that information , so they 're gonna make the argument that I was in a unique position to make it look like somebody else did it . 
It 's circumstantial , and in a lot of ways it 's a stretch , but it 's damaging . And all the evidence , no matter how circumstantial , points to me . 
And a plea ? 
- I mean , have you thought about that ? - A what ? - A plea . - Kyle . A guilty plea ? Why ... What , do you think I did this , Kyle ? Honey . 
I 'm just saying , if they offered manslaughter ... Why would I take a plea for something that I did not do ? 
Rusty . To avoid a life sentence . Manslaughter 's eight years . 
Oh , honey . 
- He thinks that I did it . 
- Rusty , he does not think you did it . Then why would he ask me to plead guilty for something - he thinks that I didn 't do ? - Because he 's scared . 
The kid is terrified . That they could put you away forever . 
Do you think that I should ? 
Does Jaden ? 
Do you think that I should accept a plea bargain ? 
Rusty , no one in this family thinks you should accept a plea bargain . 
Kyle was just ... Honey , he was just thinking aloud . 
He was thinking that I should plead guilty for murder . 
Honey , everyone is scared . 
Kate asked me to " step back " from the gallery . 
What ? Why ? 
Bad for business , I guess . 
- I 'm sorry . 
Hey . I didn 't mean to say that I thought you did it . I 'm sorry , I just ... The way you made it sound with the evidence and the ... 
I 'm sorry . 
Please don 't go . Please don 't ... I 'm sorry . 
I think we should drop the obstruction charge . Why ? 
We can make Rusty out to be a bad actor , but our burden is on homicide , all right ? 
It 's a bigger hill to climb . The jury are gonna want to get him , sure , but the obstruction charge allows them to do that without finding him guilty of murder . I just think we just put one thing on the menu . 
Right , but the abusive process charge speaks to his attempts to impede the investigation , - which goes to his guilt . - Think about it . That 's all I 'm gonna say . Right ? 
Are you up to this ? Trying this particular case ? 
Fuck yeah . Fuck yeah , I am . 
That response right there makes me nervous because it speaks to a certain zeal that Raymond is gonna exploit . 
Tommy , listen to me . 
The words that shall attach to this prosecution are " methodical , exhaustive , and fair . " Words that shall not be associated are " vindictive , maniacal , and vicious . " 
I understand , Nico . Just don 't talk to me like I 'm a monkey . 
Do you remember the first thing you said when I made you chief deputy prosecutor ? 
I believe I expressed my gratitude . 
No . The first thing you said was , " The girls are sure gonna like me now . " Turned out to be true . 
I mean , there 's just a part of you , may-maybe it 's your essence , which just needs this validation , this ... You know , to impress somebody . 
And I know smart people with a persecution complex , and some with a narcissistic complex . 
Somehow you have both . It 's like a duplex . 
Sounds expensive to fix . 
- You hate Rusty . That 's clear . - No . 
No , I don 't hate Rusty . I ... This is incredibly difficult for me . 
This is not difficult . It 's because all the slights and the digs and the nicks and the cuts , it eats at you . 
You want another drink ? Okay . We need some hard evidence for murder . 
That 's coming . 
So the site visit at Carolyn 's is later today . You feel up to that ? 
Yes . I will be there . 
Good . 
- This fucking indictment . - What are you doing ? 
" Trespass with force and arms . " It 's just ... It 's ... I mean , I 've dictated this a million times , but to read it about me is ... 
So I 've called our friend Mr. Molto twice , and I 've left messages for him . 
Well , if he doesn 't call you back , he 's gonna be in contempt . 
I left the car open . I 'll be right back . 
Did you love her ? 
- Did I what ? 
- Carolyn . Did you love her ? 
I 'm actually not really sure why that 's relevant . 
Raymond has tasked me with building your narrative for trial - in case you should have to testify . - Uh-huh . 
So he wants me to testify ? 
Well , just in case . 
Well , was it about lust ? 
Love ? 
Both ? 
Okay ... both . 
Do you remember when you first felt an emotional attachment ? 
Not when you first wanted to have sex , but ... - Yeah . No , I understand . - Okay . 
We had a ... We had a case . Sexual assault . 
The victim was a little girl . 
These are twins . This is ... We 're not trained in kindness as prosecutors . - It 's not a prerequisite . - Can you tell me ... In fact , sometimes I think it 's trained out of us , but not Carolyn . I don 't know . And that day , there was something about the tenderness that she showed that fragile little girl . 
- This is Dell . - Dell . 
- This is Perla . 
- That 's a lot of people . 
- Yeah . - Are they friends ? 
- They 're family . - They 're family ? 
So it might get a little scary in there , I 'm not gonna lie to you . But I 'm gonna be with you the whole time . 
And then if you get too scared , then you can raise your hand like this . 
Good . And I can come over , and I can hold your hand . 
We can stop whenever you want . 
I can hold you , and I can ask the judge if we can go for a walk . 
And I 'll make sure that you 're always safe . 
Do you think you can trust me with that ? To keep you safe ? 
- Yeah ? - Yeah . You 're doing so good . 
That was it . 
I guess that was the moment . 
When you crossed over the great I 'm-gonna-fuck-up-my-life-forever divide . 
Love isn 't what people tell you that it is , Mya . 
I 'm sure that I don 't have to tell you that . But in my experience , it 's just something that grows until one day ... you just find yourself needing someone . 
That 's how it was with Carolyn . 
So , yeah . Fucked up my life forever ... but I did not cross the other divide . 
I would never have hurt her . 
Somebody else did that , and whoever that person is is having a good fucking laugh while everyone comes after me . 
Strike three ! He 's out ! 
This is beautiful . 
You 're desperate . 
So we just got the big dump from Delay 's office . 
Expect them to start burying us ... Do you want another one ? documents , evidence , whatever , so we gotta keep pace . Did they turn over the labs ? Not yet . 
Well , it might be in this latest dump . You never know . The forensics team is standing by . 
It 's a little needle in the haystack at this point , you know ? But who knows ? We may find something they didn 't . My DNA must be all over this place . 
Rusty , we stipulated that you were here . 
The two of you were having an affair . It does not mean that you killed her . Unless they find her blood in your car , which they won 't , right ? 
I know . I keep seeing it too . 
Listen . Talk to me for a second . 
Rigo tells me that you 're trying to run down the contaminated semen specimen in the Bunny Davis case . Yeah . - If we offer the idea of another suspect ... - Ray . We can pretty much assume the obligation to deliver one . - And if we fail ... 
- Ray . The prosecution is gonna show the most brutal photographs of Carolyn on that night . It 's gonna be horrific . And then the jury 's gonna want someone to blame , and if we don 't have an alternative , it 's gonna be me . 
- Let it go . - No . Evidence number 13 , voicemail number four , victim 's message on defendant 's phone . 
What do you want , Rusty , out of this ? 
I don 't have much else to give . I understand wanting distance for a while but that 's partly what has been so difficult for me . 
I would be open to having another conversation if you think that it will be helpful . 
No , I hate pretending that you 're not there . I don 't understand why you 're just not picking up . 
I don 't think you understand my perspective on things . 
I need you to stop calling me like this , Rusty . This isn 't fair . I 've never disagreed with anything more . 
All the evidence I have tells me you love me . We 'll present to you physical , scientific , forensic evidence that will lead you to make your own con ... That will lead you to form your own conclusions . Think ! 
Facts !
