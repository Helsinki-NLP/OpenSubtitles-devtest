Kyle , can we talk to you for a second ? 
Your mother 's here with me too . 
Hi , honey . 
Kyle , there 's a picture of your bike at Carolyn 's house on the night of May 18th . 
Why were you there ? 
I have no idea what you 're talking about . 
Honey ... I wasn 't . I must 've just been riding by . That 's all I ... 
Kyle , there was a photograph of ... of you at Carolyn Polhemus 's house the night of May 18th . 
Why were you there ? 
Honey , we got these images from the police , so they have this evidence too . You gotta be honest . It 's important now . Oh , my God . For God 's sake , Kyle , why were you there ? 
I guess I wanted to get a sense of the there . 
The what ? 
Where you were going . So , you knew about your father and Carolyn ? 
I heard you two fighting about it . Okay . 
Does your sister know ? Does Jaden ... Does she know ? 
I didn 't tell her . I don 't know . 
When did you first find out about it ? 
Does that matter ? Well , I wouldn 't ask you if it didn 't matter . 
I don 't remember . 
A few months ago maybe . 
Okay , so that I 'm clear , you went there to see what she looked like . 
You know how to use Google , so you could find a picture of her , but you wanted to see where she lived . 
- Were you casing out her house ? - Rusty . Were you casing out her house , Kyle ? 
I just don 't understand the reasoning behind why you were going there . 
Maybe I was trying to figure out your reason . 
- I wanna talk to Mom about this . - No ! I am your father ... - Rusty . - And you 're gonna answer ... Rusty , please . 
It 's okay . 
Fine . 
Bunny Davis was a daughter . Bunny Davis was a sister , a friend , cousin . 
Bunny Davis was 26 years old when she found herself alone in a dirty motel room with a monster , and she 's praying ... pleading ... that this is the kind of man who will just let her go . 
But no . 
This man , Liam Reynolds , is the kind of person who does this ... and this ... and this . 
What do you think ? 
I think you 're amazing , Carolyn . 
This thing 's a fucking mess . 
Hey . The front porch light is out . 
So , he rode by her house a few times , and he saw you going in once . 
Obviously , we need to get him into therapy as soon as possible . 
Why ? 
Rusty , he 's been carrying this around for months . 
We have no idea of the impact . 
Okay , sure , but you and I can talk to him about this together . 
Oh , right . - Like you just talked to him right now ? - We don 't have to have ... What is that supposed to mean ? You interrogated the kid . 
I interrogated him ? 
Yeah . I was asking him questions . 
- " Why were you casing out her house ? " 
- He was there , of course I was asking . 
Asking like a prosecutor , Rusty . 
- Are you kidding me ? - He 's 15 ! 
- What the fuck is wrong with you ? - What ? 
- You caused this , Rusty . You did . - Of course . It 's me . Yes , I am the fuck-up-in-chief . But guess what . You played a part in it too . And you will , at some point , need to take some fucking responsibility . 
I can 't do this anymore . I 'm done . 
- I just ... - Done ! 
In my medical opinion , the cause of death was cranial blunt force trauma . 
So , the judge has been already told that you 're an expert , so you don 't need to qualify . You don 't need to say , " In my opinion . " - You can sit up straight . - Okay . - Just sit up straight . - You don 't gotta ... - Don 't tell me how to s ... - You 're gonna give the jury - your findings , right ? Your expertise . - Don 't ... Just ... Okay , I ... - Wow . - And you 're not gonna make it about you . What an ... No . Don 't do that . You know , I 'm doing this bullshit exercise for you , - that you got me up in the morning for ... - Which I appreciate . I am a medical doctor . You 're gonna respect me . 
I respect you as a doctor . 
As a witness , however , you are known to shit the bed . 
You fucking prick . 
Forget it . 
This is what you got me up out of bed for ? 
I 'll get that file to you by the way , scumbag . 
The details of this case are being kept close to the vest . 
There 's not been a single leak . 
I mean , how strong can this case be ? They don 't even have a murder weapon . Yeah , I don 't see how they 've cleared the bar of going beyond a shadow of a doubt . 
Hard to believe this is even going to trial . 
You know , former colleagues now at each other 's throats ... Sabich has two children ... 
- But Kyle was there . - No . He just ... He rode by , like I said . 
It was just a few times . 
- We 're sure he didn 't kill her ? - You know , you 're not funny . That 's not fucking funny . 
I wasn 't intending to be . 
So , Michael Caldwell at Carolyn 's house the night of the murder . Footage of Kyle there , a few weeks prior ? 
Jesus Christ . 
I 'm gonna have to think about this . I do not have it . 
- Fucking ... - Is there something else ? 
I just didn 't get any sleep last night , okay , Ray ? 
Is that it ? 
What is it ? 
Barbara and I got into it , you know , and she said that she was done . 
" Done " as in , " I 'm gonna leave you " ? 
Come on . If she was gonna leave you , she would 've already done it . 
- I don 't need this right now . 
- What would she be waiting for ? Good excuse ? 
You betrayed her . You betrayed your children . 
In fact , knowing Barbara , the betrayal of the children is the deeper of the two offenses . 
Ray , it 's just ... it 's complicated . - Yeah . Tell me . Come on . - It 's ... It ... Depression , compulsion , narcissism . 
I 'll take any of that . 
Let 's send you to a doctor and get a fucking diagnosis . 
But my fear is that it 'll just come back " pig . " 
Your dick got hard for Carolyn , you fucked her , and now you wanna feel less bad about it . It 's what men who cheat do , Rusty . 
They wanna have their cake , eat it , and then chalk it up to complexity . 
Jury will find it pretty simple . 
On the plus side , they 'll also find it unoriginal . 
It won 't shock their conscience . 
But for what it 's worth , it shocked me . 
It shocked Lorraine , and I 'm sure it shocked Barbara . But she 's still with you . That tells me she means to hang in . 
You know what ? Hold on a second . 
You know what ? I ... How dare you say that I don 't take responsibility , that I don 't feel shame , and that I am not consumed with guilt ? 
Fuck you . 
You know , in 40 years , I have seen a lot of guilt and shame in this business . 
Shame is something that you put on yourself . It 's self-absorbed , self-centered . 
Guilt is more about owning and feeling the pain that you cause others . 
I don 't doubt that you feel shame . 
Tommy ... Tommy , why am I on the witness list ? 
' Cause I think you have information about the relationship between Carolyn and Rusty . 
I have no information about what happened that night . 
But you might have a little information about what happened all the other nights . Right ? 
Seems to me that this is something that really should 've been reported to HR , so maybe you 're just wrestling with your own culpability here . 
Wow , you are really a miserable prick , aren 't you ? 
Hey , listen to me . We 're doing it for Carolyn , all right ? Just think about it . 
Hello , gentlemen . 
Thanks for coming in . 
How you doing ? Get you anything ? You good ? 
I 'm not really comfortable with all this . 
I completely understand . It 's awful . 
But as we 're building this case against Mr. Sabich , every detail becomes enormously important , and the defense is gonna come at you with all these questions . 
Shouldn 't we have a lawyer with us ? 
That 's entirely up to you , but I 'm just confirming information that we already discussed . 
This is a photo you took of Mr. Sabich entering your mother 's house the night she was killed . It 's June 16th , 9 : 49 p.m. Is that correct ? Yes . 
And all these other photos you took on the same night ? Yes . 
Why didn 't you take pictures of him leaving the house ? 
I left after he went in . 
Why were you there ? 
Sometimes I would just go . 
Why ? 
He already answered that . 
Okay . This is extremely important for us to iron out , because they 're gonna ask the same questions , okay ? The defense . 
Because she was my mother . Sometimes I 'd go look at the house . 
You ever see anyone else entering the house ? 
He was the only one there that night . 
How did Mr. Sabich seem as he entered the house ? 
What was his demeanor ? 
I don 't know . 
And during this meeting that you had with him , how did he seem ? 
You said that during this meeting , you accused him of killing your mother . Is that right ? I mean , he denied it , but he was lying . 
Why do you say that ? How do you know that ? 
I could see it in his eyes . 
Also , once , she told me she was becoming afraid of him . 
But I thought you didn 't ... When did you have contact with your mother ? 
I had convinced her to meet me for lunch . 
She seemed stressed , and I got pissed off because I thought it was me . 
And then I asked her what was wrong , and she said that there 's a man at work that 's beginning to scare her . 
- Did she say who this man was ? - Nah . 
She said that she had cases with him , which is why she couldn 't shake him . 
- Hey . - Hi . What can I get you ? 
I think ... Belvedere martini . No olives , no juice . 
I 've been talking about you all week . 
Nah , that 's not how it sounds like . Okay . 
Shift drink , Clif ? 
I wasn 't , but I will now . 
I got these bartender hands . It 's messed up all the time . 
How 's the drama ? 
- Same old . - Yeah ? I bet . Mind if I join you ? 
- Sure , yeah . - Yeah ? 
Clifton . 
- Barbara . - Barbara . Nice to officially meet you . 
What is that stuff , that cream ? Yes . This stuff . Jeanine makes it . 
Yeah , it 's cocoa butter infused with weed . 
Don 't put your fingers in your mouth . - You will get very high . - Okay . - Thank you for the heads-up . 
- Of course . Indeed . 
That is so generous . Thank you . 
So tell me about your tattoos . 
I ask , realizing it 's very clichÃ © to ask about someone 's tattoos . Yeah . I get it . This . I 'm somewhat of an artist too . 
Mainly projection art , but I designed this during my youthful idiocy . 
It 's the Yijing . 
You know about that ? 
I know about John Cage , Brian Eno , and the random creative operation of things . Right . 
I 'm also very familiar with youthful idiocy . 
- Cheers . - Cheers . 
Rigo . 
Guess what I got . 
A hit on the second sample in the Bunny Davis case . 
How did you do that ? 
I didn 't find any matches in the whole system . 
Ratzer . Address ? 
Do we know anything about him ? 
Not really , other than he left a sperm sample at a homicide scene involving a dead prostitute . 
Look , thank you for doing this . I know you 're putting your ass out on the line . 
I 'm not doing it for you . I 'm doing it for Carolyn . 
Rusty , I 'm gonna need you to chill in there , okay ? 
Do not say anything . 
- Hello , ma 'am . - Hi . Sorry to disturb you . We 're with CPD . 
We 're looking for Brian Ratzer . Is he home ? 
Hon ! 
He 's down the basement . 
Would you like to come inside and I 'll go get him ? 
Sure . 
Hon. 
Hon ? - Yeah . - The police are here . 
Please , have a seat . He 'll be right up . - Great . Thanks . - Coffee ? 
Sure . 
Hey . - Hi . - What can I do for you ? 
We 're looking into some incidents that happened in this area , June 16th , 2019 . 
The night of . We 're just canvassing . 
What incident are you looking into ? 
Some break-ins . 
Not on this street . A few miles east , on Robertson . 
It was a Thursday night . I know it 's a while to think back , but ... I don 't need to think back . I don 't know the street . 
If it happened at night , I work nights . 
Where do you work ? 
Hey , can I see your badge ? Sure . 
It 's just that - a sex worker was found murdered , so ... - Here we go . 
Yeah . Not now , babe , okay ? 
I said not now . Okay . 
What is this about exactly ? 
I just told you . 
Where do you work , Mr. Ratzer ? 
Did you answer the question ? 
I don 't need to answer any questions . 
Sooner or later , you 're gonna have to answer the questions . I mean , you 're gonna have to have the conversation at some point . 
Don 't I know you from someplace ? 
Here 's my card . 
You give me a call when you 're ready to talk . And if I don 't ? 
I think you 're gonna have to . 
And I think you know why . 
Or maybe we should ask your wife . - Hey , Laura . - Hey . 
- It 's okay , babe . - Yeah ? 
What 's going on ? Do you need something ? 
Just wanted to say thank you for the coffee . You 're welcome . Is everything okay ? Yeah . 
Get the fuck out of here . 
I told you not to agitate him . 
I just asked him one question . 
You are un-fucking-believable . 
Why do you look so scared ? 
Why do you look so scared ? 
B , what are you doing ? 
Not taking any chances . 
He was riding by her house . 
Who 's to say he didn 't walk through her garden , look through her window , stand on her doormat ... - Hey . Hey . - Ring her doorbell ? 
Come on . 
I don 't think that Kyle is a suspect . 
Sometimes I think you forget our son is Black . 
How did it make you feel to see your dad go in her house ? 
You wanna talk about it ? 
- You must have feelings . 
- But I don 't wanna talk about them . 
A lot worse shit has happened since I saw him go in her house . 
You kidding ? 
This is ridiculous . 
I made zero progress , not that we often do right off . 
Early sessions can be more about establishing trust , and I think I failed there too . 
Look , speaking to the ... the bigger issue , I think we need to redraw some lines . 
Okay . What do you mean ? 
This thing has become way too layered and loaded for me to treat you , Rusty , Rusty and you , and now Kyle in the midst of ... It really should be one therapist per . 
Per ? Like we have that kind of money . 
I think I should take you , and only you . 
I know . 
Can you s ... I think it 's possible that you do wanna forgive Rusty and stay married to him . 
I also think it 's possible ... that your limbic system is just ... it 's going full-bore . 
You are in self-defense mode , trying to save your marriage for your kids , doing whatever you consciously or unconsciously deem necessary . 
You have always been about preservation of family . 
But I also think it 's possible that when the kids are grown or off to college , this compulsion to forgive could metastasize into something else , like anger or hatred even . 
Could be it 's already happening . 
Look , your husband fell in love with another woman . 
He 's now facing trial for killing her . 
You need your own therapist . 
So , Eugenia came by my office earlier . What did she say ? Why ? What did she say ? 
Hey , hey . I got no issue with you calling her as a witness , all right ? It 's just ... If she 's gonna be your witness , it might help for her to be in your camp . 
Tell me what she said . She said that ... She said that you 're an asshole , all right ? 
But we know you can be a little ... Okay . Listen , I 'm my best prosecutorial-self when I 'm angry . You know that . Yeah , but if your plan is to rely on hostile witnesses to make your case ... Eugenia will bend over any which way she can to help Rusty . 
I think she 's a little in love with him . 
I need to tell her to toe the line . 
No . The line you need to toe is one of hard evidence , all right ? 
Character assassination is not gonna get it done . 
I 'll give you hard evidence . Don 't worry . 
I am worried . I 'm worried . Raymond 's asked for a meeting . 
Why ? What about ? Well , I can only imagine it 's because he thinks he 's got a play on a plea . 
And if he thinks that , he must feel that he 's got us by the balls . 
He hasn 't got my balls , Tommy . Has he got yours ? 
There 's no chance of any plea . 
No . Plus , we need to find out if there are other sex workers in the area and if they can recognize Ratzer . 
I mean , the guy fucking knows something . I 'm sure of it . - Of course . 
- You ready ? - Yeah . Look , I 'll call you back . - Sure . 
Can you take me through that night again ? 
You said you were at the office that night . 
Yes . A few of us were working late on Raymond 's campaign , ostensibly working on Raymond 's campaign . 
Ostensibly ? 
Well , I was mostly texting . 
And getting no messages back ... which I wasn 't really handling very well . 
And she was basically ghosting me , so I needed somewhere to go . 
And what time did you leave the office ? 
A little after 8 : 30 . 
So I 'd sometimes eat out because I just ... I wasn 't in any state to go home . 
I don 't really remember much from the bar . 
Guess I had a few things to drink . 
Maybe I ordered another . I don 't know . 
And then she texted back , and I was off to the races . 
So the text from her comes in at 9 : 24 p.m. Michael Caldwell 's photos show you arriving at 9 : 49 . 
What happened ? 
I mean , I don 't know how much detail you want here , but ... Hey . 
What happened ... 
- What ? - I just ... What happened ? I don 't know why you 're so angry . 
What happened ? 
Miss you so much . 
Well , mostly , we argued . You argued ? I wanted to get back together , and she didn 't , - and , I mean , that was pretty much it . - Stop . - Hey . - Leave ! 
Cell metadata has you arriving home at 11 : 00 on the nose . 
It 's a 20-minute drive from her house to yours , which means you left at 10 : 40 . 
You were at her house for 51 minutes . 
Long argument . 
Get the fuck out of here . 
And then you just left after that ? 
Then we kissed goodbye . 
You kissed ? 
Yes , and then I went home . 
When she kissed me , she knew that it would give me hope . 
I mean , the kiss got me to the car . It got me to go home . 
But when I got home , I realized that ... that hope had just turned into cruelty . 
She knew what she was doing . 
She was fucking cruel . 
So , what 's your take so far ? 
Well , on the case , I kind of like where we 're at . 
They 'll have a hard time making their burden . At the same time , 51 minutes . They 'll argue it 's long enough to have tied her , cleaned the scene . 
Or had sex , or argued , or had a fight and made up . 
What about Rusty ? Thoughts about putting him on the stand ? 
There is no way we let that man anywhere near the witness chair . 
Agreed . 
What 'd we find out about Ratzer ? 
There 's gotta be something there . 
He got an alibi ? 
Right , no prior arrests ? 
We use CPD in Illinois State ? We got nothing . All right . Well , he was with Reynolds , right ? 
Well , he was there with Reynolds , with Bunny Davis . 
We just have to fucking prove it . 
Yeah , just keep ... just keep at it . Just keep pushing . 
Hey , Molto . 
Okay . Thank you . 
Hey ... I know that we said a lot to each other the other night . And ... I just want you to know that I heard ... I heard you . 
Rusty , can we talk about this when I get home ? I 'm just about to step into the market . - Yeah , of course . Yeah . - Okay ? 
I love you . 
Love you . 
You know , I 'm really starting to understand the allure of day drinking . 
You ever night drink ? 
I have appearances to uphold . 
Like what ? 
Mom . Wife . All the shit you probably don 't wanna hear about . 
Oh , on the contrary . 
Yeah , I 'm deeply curious on what it 's like to be you right now . 
Honestly ... I don 't know . 
Well , if you ever want to talk and should I not be here ... Thank you . 
- Hey , Chris . - Hey , Raymond . 
- Helen . - Hey . 
Eugenia . 
Oh , my God . Hi . Raymond . Oh , my God . How are you ? I 'm hanging in . You ? I 'm on the witness list . - I saw that . - Yeah . I knew about the two of ' em . 
Well , I wouldn 't lose any sleep . We 're not denying the relationship . Okay . 
Well , do me a favor , will you ? Tell Rusty I have no intent of giving testimony against him , okay ? 
- I 'll do that . 
- Hi , guys . 
- Raymond . It 's good to see you , as always . 
Okay , let 's get right to it . 
You two have a really fucking lousy case , and I think you both know it . 
I mean , it 's not a complete nothing burger . He was there , last seen with her . 
That 's something , but it 's shitty all the same . 
We disagree . 
Not a drop of her blood found in Rusty 's car , none of her DNA at all . 
Blood and guts everywhere at her home , not so much as a microscopic drop in his car . 
- He cleaned it . 
- Or on his clothing . - Cleaned it also . - No murder weapon . 
Disposed of it . 
You 're not gonna be able to settle on a theory , you know ? 
Being tied up like that , that speaks to premeditation . Death by fire poker ? Heat of passion . 
Right from the get-go , your case is a fucking mess . 
Well , we love a challenge . 
I know that there is a reason you brought the lesser charge of obstruction , and I would 've done the same thing , so you could get him on something . ' Cause walking away with nothing ... What is your point ? 
I can see that someone 's been directed not to speak . 
- Smart . - All right , great . Please , just ... Rusty cannot risk spending the rest of his natural life in prison , and you cannot chance an acquittal and the obliteration of all of your political capital . 
We 'll cop to the obstruction , three years . 
Ray , you seriously think we 'll plead it out on an obstruction charge ? 
Nico , you know you moved too fast . 
Tommy , he was dying for a suspect . The idea that it could possibly have been Rusty , well ... Is that right ? 
Fuck you . Let 's talk about your bigger problem sitting right here . 
You 've got a shitty , circumstantial case , first-chaired by a fucking nickel-and-dimer , going against me . 
You 're not stupid , Nico . 
I 'm giving you a conviction . 
And with Judge Lyttle , I 've got a very good shot at a required finding of not guilty . 
That is a political death knell . 
I 'm offering you an escape hatch . 
- What 's this ? - Just have a read . Just check it out . 
Why am I just seeing this now ? 
We just got it ourselves . 
That wasn 't the kind of sex we have . 
Well , not for a long time , anyway . 
Was it the kind of sex you had with her ? 
She isn 't you . 
She wasn 't . 
I think what I find hard to understand is ... did you ask yourself ... what you were willing to lose ? 
We were so far apart , you and me . 
I feel like , at the time , we couldn 't even have a conversation . 
But she woke something up inside me , you know ? 
Something ... that I thought was dead . 
When you said I needed to take responsibility ... B , I don 't think I meant it the way you ... I don 't think you were wrong , Rusty . 
I think we allowed ourselves ... to drift apart . 
Even the sex we just had now , it felt like we were trying to prove something . 
That what we had is still there . 
Is it ? 
Fucking Raymond . 
I 'm gonna take it . 
Our case just took a turn . 
Your skin was found under Carolyn 's fingernails . 
What ? That 's ... Wait . That 's impossible . It 's in the report . I just learned about it . 
No . It 's ... I ... Ray , she never scratched me . Like ... It 's a fucking lie . 
DNA is DNA , Rusty . 
No , it 's a lie . I ... Oh , my God . I can 't believe that they 're going ahead and doing this . Who ? 
Fucking Molto and Delay , and Kumagai , all of them . - Oh , come on . - What do you mean ? I ... She never scratched me . It 's fucking planted . They don 't have a case . They have no case , so they 're fucking trying to frame me . 
Dad ! Come on ! Open it up ! I know you 're in there ! 
- Fuck . What ? - There 's gotta be a reason for this . - Dad ! - No , I ... - What is it ? What 's going on ? 
- There 's someone at the door ! 
Raymond , hold on . What 's wrong ? - I don 't know . - Hey , calm down . - I was just watching TV and ... - Okay . Honey , honey , calm down . It 's okay . Hey ! Stop banging at my door ! 
- Who is it ? 
- I don 't know ! Rusty . Jaden ! - You come and fuck with my family ! - Dad , who is that ? - Hold on ! Just stop ! - I 'm gonna call the cops . No ! Do not call the police , Barbara . Just let me think . Open this door up . 
- Jaden , step away from the door ! - Step away ! - Open the fucking door ! - Just ho ... - Rusty . - Mr. Ratzer ! Listen to me . 
- You come and fuck with my family ... - I 'm the one you want . - Step away from my house . - I 'll fuck with your family ! 
- Honey , come here . Honey . - Mr. Ratzer ! - Listen to me ... 
One more time ! I swear to God ! - Rusty ! - Dad ! - Rusty , Stop ! - Enough ! Look at me ! 
- Please ! Dad . - Rusty !
