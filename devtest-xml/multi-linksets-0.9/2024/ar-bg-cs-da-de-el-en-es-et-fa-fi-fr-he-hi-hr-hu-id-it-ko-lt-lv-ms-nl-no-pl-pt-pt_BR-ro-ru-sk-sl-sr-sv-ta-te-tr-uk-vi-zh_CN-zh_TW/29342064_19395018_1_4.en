Are we nearly there ? 
I 've got wet socks . 
It must be minus 50 . 
Daddy ? 
What do we do now ? 
Hot chocolate ? 
I mean , where do we live ? 
Well , we could go back to England . 
We could stay here in Sweden . 
We could go anywhere , really . 
I mean , we don 't have any ... You remember the last time we were here ? 
That was the last summer with Mamma . 
I 'm nervous . 
Well , she 's not gonna be here . You know that , right ? 
We 're not gonna see her again . 
Merry delayed Christmas and happy delayed birthday ! 
Okay . " The Spanish fireman has two sons . What are they called ? " 
" Jose and Hose B. " 
That 's pretty good . 
What ? 
That was crap . 
You know , they 're supposed to be crap . That 's the point . 
You say one . Oh , no . 
- Yeah . - Yeah . You do one . 
Okay . Okay , I got one . 
It 's sort of similar to that one . 
- But it 's kind of Swedish though . - I 'm married to a Swede . Go ahead . 
Okay , so , Nelson Mandela has a Swedish half-brother . 
Who 's Nelson Mandela ? 
It 's not gonna work if you don 't know who Nelson Mandela is . 
I know who he was . 
Okay , so Nelson Mandela has a Swedish half-brother called ... MÃ¥ste ManDela . 
It 's really funny in Swedish . 
You changed around the cupboards . 
No , I 'm not really a move-the-cupboards-around kind of guy . 
Jo , can we have a talk ? 
Yeah , of course . 
It 's just ... We didn 't really leave things in a very satisfactory way when you went . 
How did we leave things ? 
Well , you didn 't look at me when we said goodbye . 
Of course I did . No . You didn 't . 
I 've thought about it a lot the last year . 
I don 't know if you noticed , but it was a really appalling few months . 
For me , at least . Before you went away . 
I 'm sorry . 
That 's not how I remember it . 
I 'm back , and I 'm not going anywhere . 
Do you love me ? 
But of course I do . 
I 'm not being needy . It 's a genuine question . 
Of course I love you , you big idiot . 
- Hello . 
- Welcome back , ma 'am . 
Thank you . 
What about this one ? " How the Sand Got to the Sea " . 
Do you want to toss it or keep it ? 
You don 't understand me , do you ? 
I was just asking if you wanted to keep it or toss it . 
Toss it . 
Gone . 
The Changeling . 
Yeah . The one when the trolls take the baby . 
And they put the baby in the fire to bring the mamma back . 
Was there anything specific that upset you before I left ? 
We don 't have to talk about it . 
Is the Allen key anywhere ? Yeah . 
- It 's this one , right ? - Yeah . 
We hardly saw you . 
I mean , obviously there was that washout of a summer up at the cabin , but you were away training . A lot . So , there wasn 't , like , one specific thing ? 
You know , there is gonna come a day when I have assembled my last piece of shitty furniture and I am not gonna have to do this again . 
Magnus , what ? 
I 'm not a jealous person . I hope you know that . 
But I had really started to wonder about you and Frederic . 
What ? 
Absolutely not . No . Look , things are going really well with us . 
- So this would be a good time to level with me . 
But , Magnus , I didn 't have an affair with Frederic . 
I would never do something like that . 
- Right . 
- Magnus , please . 
I just want us to be honest with each other . Yeah . 
Jo , while you were gone ... I kind of met someone . 
What ? 
I mean , nothing happened really . 
But , we went for a drink . 
One kiss . What ? 
I thought you were leaving me , Jo . 
You know , there was a lot ... a lot of gossip about you and Frederic . 
I assumed you 'd come back , and we 'd be done . But why ? 
- Like ... - Just trying to level with you . Yeah . I want you to be my husband , okay ? I want Alice to be my daughter . 
When I was up there , the only thing I could focus on was getting home and assembling shitty furniture . 
When I was up there , all alone , and no one could hear me , and I thought I was gonna die . 
Daddy ? Daddy . Come . 
Magnus ... I really grieve the time I 've lost with you and her . 
I couldn 't cope if ... Daddy ? 
Sorry . 
Mr. Rogers ? 
- Mr. Rogers ? - Just a second . 
- Is he ... 
- Bud , all speakers are supposed to go to the main hall . Emergency briefing . Yeah , I just wanted to say ... Attention , please . Ladies and gentlemen , this is the captain speaking . 
We are turning and making a call in Santa Barbara . 
It looks like there was an incident with one of our guests overnight . 
We have to complete a few necessary safeguards and procedures . 
We will be asking you to stay on board , and we hope this won 't inconvenience you too badly . 
Henry , you are funded by NASA , and you are a NASA employee . 
And have been since long before you were born , Michaela . 
We need to talk about the fact that no permission is granted to you to go to another space agency with RPL equipment . 
The CAL is mine . 
It didn 't work , Henry . 
No , please don 't say that . 
I know . It 's very tough to let go . 
Yeah , well , this is not what failure looks like . I just need to think it through . It 's having an effect . 
You need to come home , okay ? 
You 've had ten days with a lot of assistance and there 's no evidence the CAL worked . We 're shutting it down . 
This is the end of the project . Henry ... I misremember things . 
Such as ? 
Where things are . My car . 
I remember it as red , but it 's blue . 
It 's a small thing , but ... Actually , it 's quite a big thing . 
I think ... I think I ... I have a piano in my house , and I don 't play the piano . 
Do you have hallucinations ? 
What kind ? 
I see Paul Lancaster . 
I mean , I ... His ghost , I suppose . 
Sometimes it feels like I 'm still up there on the ISS . 
What you are telling me seems highly symptomatic of PTSD , where you would expect replays of stressful events , memory lapses , anger . 
It 's not surprising you would have this condition . You were in fear of your life , very concerned about your crew , your family . Dealing with the death of a friend , you 've been through huge trauma . 
Now you 're back to Earth , and this can be where it hits you . 
Listen , we 'll try you with a dexamethasone-suppression test and see what your cortisol levels are . 
And in the meantime , I can give you something . Such as ? 
Lithium . 
Jenny , I 'm not psychotic . I 'm not depressed . 
No , but it 'll calm you . 
It calms these things . 
I don 't want this . I don 't ... This kind of stuff is career-ending . 
I 'm interested in the research you 're doing . 
What 's it called , " salutogenesis " ? 
- I ... - How do you define it ? 
I didn 't know you were here . I 'm here . 
Think it 's a better place for me to be . I think I can help . 
So how is it going for you ? 
With the CAL , you mean ? 
Well , I keep running it and running it . 
I think I may be on the edge of something . 
I don 't remember much about the CAL before the accident , I ... - I ... - Would you like to see it ? 
I 'm not getting a hell of a lot of stuff I understand . 
Have you heard much anecdotal evidence from astronauts ? How it affects them ? It 's not all good . 
I know some felt burned out . Oh , yeah . 
People find it tough . 
Go through things they don 't understand . Yeah . 
I have a couple of friends ... Gemini IV crew ... Chuck Parks , John Cooper ... They smelled burning toast up there . Both of them . 
John heard a dog barking . 
Always said it was Laika . 
You know , I wonder how Laika felt . 
You a dog person ? 
It 's always been the case since we started flying high altitude . 
I was a test pilot , pre-Apollo . 
Flying the highest altitudes you can , right up to the edge of space . 
It was pretty common back then for colleagues to report a powerful force pressing down on one of the wings of the aircraft above 90,000 feet . 
They called it " the left hand of God . " 
I knew this guy . Lost his son . 
Little boy , six years old , drowned in a lake on his baby sister 's birthday . 
This guy , a couple years later , flying DC-10s over Nevada , heard a voice . 
His son 's voice . " Daddy , watch out . " 
Noticed that he 'd plunged into a dive , managed to pull out . 
Till the end of his life , he swore his son saved him . 
They don 't say it , but that 's the kind of thing that followed us into space . 
You ever seen anything that wasn 't there ? 
Like climbing Everest , going into space . Your whole focus is on the summit . And if you 're not very careful , you can forget that once you 've summited , you have to get back down . 
That 's when people come unstuck . 
I have to check this . It 's running again . 
- Hi . - It 's Papa . I can 't talk . 
It 's not working . 
Oh , God . There were a few good years but ... Christ , I need to find a way around it . I gotta find a way to get to that motherfucker . 
Papa , you gotta stop thinking like all this stuff is outside of you . 
Connie , it 's not an illness . 
It is an illness . No one fucked with your brain . 
It 's you . It 's something you can control . 
Look , if you 're having an episode , please just take your pills . 
Like I said , I can 't talk . 
She speaks about death and accidents . 
- And there 's this cupboards issue . - What do you mean ? 
- She hides in cupboards . Yeah . - She hides in cupboards . 
It strikes me that maybe you 're a system that has lost each other a bit . 
She 's ten . She was nine when you left . 
That 's a long year . It 's a very liminal age . 
What do you mean with " liminal " ? 
Between one thing and another . Yes . Exactly . 
She wants to change things , like her room . 
And for a year , you 've had the father and the daughter , and so Mom is ... Mom 's been too far apart . She was in space . And now she 's come back , and maybe Alice isn 't sure . 
Maybe she 's haunted by her feelings of , " Mom is ... Well , " Who-who are you ? 
Can I trust you ? " 
What have you told her ? 
She knows things that are private . 
She 's my colleague and Alice 's teacher . 
What did Jenny say ? 
Jenny said that I have PTSD . 
There 's nothing to worry about . I 'm fine . Don 't tell anyone . 
Do you think something is wrong with my attachment to Alice ? 
- No ? Well , of course there is . 
I 've been away for a year . 
" Who are you ? 
Can I trust you ? " 
- She didn 't say Alice couldn 't trust you . 
- You just sat there agreeing with her . 
Try the spare room . 
Are you here ? 
Alice , get out of there . 
Alice , now . 
What ? 
I got some old clothes that you might like . 
Baby . Come . 
We haven 't really had enough Mamma-Alice time . 
Maybe we could go away somewhere . 
Just us ? 
Well , no . Daddy , of course , too . 
We could go to the cabin . 
What about school though ? 
School have had you for a whole year . 
Baby , don 't shut me out . I 'm not . 
You 're not happy I 'm back ? 
I don 't know . 
I 'm just a little bit disappointed . 
I thought it would be different . 
At the center of the CAL is a chamber containing a gas of rubidium atoms . Around it is an arrangement of lasers , electromagnets . 
- A magnetic trap . - Understood . To achieve the condensate , the laser is turned to resonate the atoms . 
Then , when the laser is turned off , that 's when the superposition is formed . 
You formed it ? 
A black blob ... Two black blobs alongside . 
This is the image we got on board the ISS . 
There 's an interference effect , Henry . There can 't be an interference effect . 
What 's the data now ? 
- Here . - What is this ? It looks like a child 's picture of an owl or something . 
It doesn 't wanna be seen . What ? 
But trust me , when I 've run it down here ... When you 've run it down here ? That 's what I see . 
Then show me the data . 
This is the data . I can 't , Louis . 
It 's there , clear as day inside the halo , but it 's just me who sees it . 
Henry , I 'm sorry . You can 't have built a pathway to another universe . 
What you saw from the ISS was a false image . No . The CAL experiment was meant to capture a state in which one particle is in two different states at the same time . 
And we did it . 
Henry , an experiment went wrong , and you got a false image . But you can always run it again . 
No , sir , I cannot goddamn well run it again ' cause we 're never going back up there . 
Listen , Louis , what if the result of the experiment could theoretically make themselves visible in different ways ? 
Like ? 
Not on a screen . In the mind of an observer . 
Of what you see in the world around you . What if it works on the chemistry of the brain ? 
Come on . The whole history of quantum physics is bound up with the observer effect , the effect that looking at something has upon the experiment . 
What if the experiment is having an effect on me ? 
It has to hurt , right ? When someone doesn 't believe you . 
Agent Bright , FBI . 
You know what we 're discussing here is a psychological illness in which these people can 't see reality as it is . 
Now , it might have passed you by , Agent Bright , but truth is a rare commodity . 
Has that passed you by in law enforcement ? No . 
I was on the moon . I walked there . 
There 's proof . I left a golf ball . 
No one is doubting that you walked on the moon . 
We just wanna know what happened to this man on the ship . 
You came and interrupted him at dinner . 
Yeah , to talk to him . Make him see sense . 
They 're gonna drop me off in Santa Barbara , okay ? 
You said something like , if Mr. Rogers were to tussle with you , you would throw him in the damn sea . 
No , Agent Bright , I haven 't been able to lift this shoulder past 45 degrees since I crashed my plane in Korea . 
And even if I could , I wouldn 't . 
I 'm an astronaut . 
The right stuff . 
What are you doing ? 
I 'm an autonomous human being . 
I don 't need anyone 's permission to be anywhere . 
Goddamn it , I want us to agree on what 's causing this . 
Convince me that I am not going insane .

" Canadian astronaut on trial . 
Assumed false identity before attempting murder on ex-husband , new family . " 
" Caldera , Henry . " 
What are you doing ? 
Guys , stop it ! 
Whatever I do here with my own time and my own life is a matter only for me . 
Excuse me , Henry . 
If you hadn 't been so fucking curious , none of this would have been an issue . 
Are you okay , Henry ? 
Commander Caldera ? 
Curiosity killed the cat . 
We both had a lot of time to think about things ... and no time to talk . 
About what ? 
Obviously something 's changed , and I 'm sorry if I said things that were inappropriate . 
But I want you , Jo , just as much as before . 
I want us to serve out the contracts here and go private , like we said . 
I 've been talking to them . StarCosm , Alyanna . 
They like it . Especially if it 's the two of us as a package . 
California . 
I don 't know what you are talking about . 
Jo , look . 
I think you owe it to me to tell me if you 've changed your mind . 
Have you changed your mind ? 
There 's a lot of weird differences between Earth and space , and it 's not just the gravity . 
Time passes at a different speed on Earth and in space . 
So after six months in space , an astronaut have aged 0.007 seconds less than a person who remains on Earth . 
What happens to it ? 
- Do you , like , understand anything ? - To what ? Where do the 0.7 seconds go ? 
Is it you ? 
- Huh ? - Yeah , I 'm talking to you . 
Is it her , Magnus ? 
What 's happening ? 
Is it her ? 
Come on , Jo . 
- I 'm sorry , Sara . - " I 'm sorry , Sara . " 
- Leave my husband alone , okay ? 
What the hell was that ? 
Give me the keys . 
This is ridiculous . 
You 're not supposed to drive for a couple of weeks . 
I know how to drive a fucking car . 
Don 't swear in front of our daughter . You 're acting like the town drunk . 
Can we put on a song ? 
I have to concentrate a bit . 
Alice , I need to concentrate , okay ? 
Alice , turn it off . Turn it off , Alice ! 
- Alice , for Christ 's sake ! 
The various space agencies have rehab clinics for astronauts who ... There 's a condition called astronaut burnout . 
For God 's sake , she 's just come back . - I can 't have her going away again . 
- She 's got a problem . 
It 's obviously a reaction to the stress of what went on in space . 
And , without an intervention , she 'll get worse . 
And are you going with her ? 
Don 't know . 
Yeah , maybe . To begin with . 
Did you have an affair with her ? 
- What did she say ? - Never mind what she said . Did you ? 
- What 's this ? - Magnus asked me here because he 's concerned about you . 
You lied to me . 
What ? 
He 's concerned because you 're behaving in quite a ... dissociated way . 
I can speak for myself , you piece of shit . 
What have you said to him ? 
I told him the truth . 
I hon ... Honestly , I ... I didn 't remember . I-I didn 't ... How the fuck do you forget something like that ? 
Clearly there 's some memory issues going on . Fuck off ! 
If you 're having these symptoms , Jo , we can easily get you the appropriate help . I need to talk to my husband . 
Get the fuck out of my house . Go ! 
I 'm not crazy . 
Frederic , I work for you . 
This is my home . You don 't belong here . I 'm not at work . 
Fine . Fine . 
We 'll go through HR tomorrow . 
It 's good to have all this out in the open though . 
I didn 't lie to you . 
I am not a fucking fool . 
I didn 't remember . 
I don 't remember . I don 't remember ! 
Maybe this isn 't the same fucking place that I left . 
It 's exactly the same , Jo ! 
It 's you that 's different . Daddy ! 
Wait . Magnus ! Hey , Magnus ... Why don 't you try taking care of your child for a change ? 
" Marine Observatory . Denmark . " 
" Dear Commander Ericsson ... you 'll find enclosed two tapes . 
We heard you when you were on the ISS on October 15th . 
The recording is not clear , but we are sending it to you with a transcript . " 
The fuck 's the matter with you ? 
You 're the one who tells people you walked on the moon when you didn 't . You 're a liar , you 're a coward , and you 're a thief .

" The second recording made by ourselves on November 23rd , 1967 . It appears to show an accident in space and a death of a female cosmonaut . " 
Mummy ? 
- Alice ? What is it ? Alice ? - It 's me ! 
Wha ... What are you seeing ? 
You 're dead . 
- Don 't wake her up . - She 's awake . 
- It 's Wendy 's dad . - What ? Paul ? 
For God 's sake , Jo , just leave it . 
- I want to go . - Come here . 
- Wait , no . Put her down . - Come here . Come on . Magnus . Where you taking her ? 
Don 't put her in a cupboard ! 
- Don 't put her in the fucking cupboard ! 
- I want to . 
How is that gonna make things better ? 
I want Daddy to tuck me in . 
- Don 't put her in the fucking cupboard ! 
- She 's scared of you , Jo . Okay ? You 're scaring her . 
Just go away . Go downstairs . 
I mean , what were you doing ? 
Why are you putting her in the cupboard ? 
She 's scared . She wants to hide . 
How long has she been scared ? How long do you think ? 
Take the pills that Jenny gave you . 
You know what ? - Those pills , they are antipsychotics . - Of course they are . That 's the point . 
No , no , no , wait . I mean , both are . 
The vitamins and ... Both sets , they ... There 's a concerted effort to get me on antipsychotic medication . 
They want to deny what I saw up there . 
Just take the fucking pills , Jo . 
What are you doing ? 
I 'm gonna call Frederic back because he 's actually right . 
No , I need to sort this out . And you need to help me . 
I need to work out why they 're doing this . 
I am helping you , Jo . 
Why are you calling Frederic ? 
I was the one that was supposedly fucking him . 
Don 't ! 
I know you could all hear me when I was up there . 
When I was up there and I was trying to get back home and I was afraid , you could all hear me . I heard those tapes . And you were gonna leave me up there to die . Jo . 
- Put the phone down . - I 'm sorry . 
Put the fucking phone down . - I will ... I will still be here ! - Put ...
