Ray , Ray , Ray ? You okay ? Hey , hey . - I 'm his wife . 
- Hey , somebody call an ambulance ! Did you call an ambulance ? 
- Sensing erratic pulse . - IV started in the right arm . 
Okay . Let 's make sure his O2 is at eight liters . 
He 's gonna need a 12-lead EKG , a full blood panel , CBC and cross . 
He 's going into V-tach , check his pulse . 
We 've lost the pulse . 
- Hey , honey . 
- I 'm home with the kids . How is he ? 
He 's still in surgery . - As Raymond Horgan ... - Okay . - I 'll keep you posted , okay ? - Okay . - I love you . - Yeah . Bye . ... after suffering from an apparent cardiac arrest . - Definitely an unexpected turn of events . - God . We 're not hearing at all if this trial is actually going to continue at this point . 
Rae , is there any precedent at all for this type of thing happening ? A defendant jumping in and saving his attorney 's life ? 
You know , it typically works the other way around . But to answer your question , there 's no rule . It 's up to the judge . 
And given the one we have here , I 'd say anything goes at this time . 
Okay , so if it 's a mistrial , they do it all over again ? It seems so . 
This is so fucked . 
Hey , you want something to drink ? You want some water or something like that ? 
Yeah . - Yeah , thank you . - Yeah ? 
Lorraine , I just want to say I 'm so sorry . And if there 's any way I can help ... I know that rings hollow ... but whatever I can do ... 
- Thank you . - Yeah . - Okay . - Thanks . 
- Mrs. Horgan ? - Yeah ? - Mrs. Horgan ? 
- Yeah . He 's gonna be okay . Improved , even . 
- Really ? - It wasn 't a coronary . - It was a bradycardia . - Oh , my ... It 's an electrical issue that slowed his heart rate down to a near stop . We gave him a pacemaker . There 's no neurological damage . 
- He 'll walk out improved . - Thank you , Doctor . 
So he 's gonna be okay ? 
- He 's gonna be all right , fine . - Yeah . Better . He 's in recovery right now . 
He 'll be in his room in a few hours and you 'll be able to see him then . Oh , my God . 
- Thank you . - Yeah . You 're welcome . Yeah ? 
We got a problem . 
Yeah , we got a problem . 
The jury just saw Rusty go all hero an ... We need to move for a mistrial . - What ? - Yeah . - We ... - We 're winning . 
- I 'm not so sure of that . 
- A mistrial and he walks . - No . We don 't know that . 
- Yes , we do . Come on . Second time through , he 's gonna know our hand . Think about this . As lying , cheating psychopaths go , - he 's a pretty charming guy , right ? - It doesn 't ... And he just saved a human life in front of the jury . It can also be argued that the jury just saw him act impulsively , physically in a way that they saw him snap . But you have to just trust the jury . 
Know that they 're more equipped to visualize what happened that night than either of us . 
So , the question is , " Now what ? " 
You can 't keep going without your head counsel this deep into a murder trial . 
Maybe they put things on pause ? 
I 'm pretty sure that 's not how it works . 
From everything I 'm reading from legal experts , it ... So what are we thinking ? 
Are we thinking ? 
Mr. Delay Guardia , you certainly seem cognitively overdue . 
I 'm just weighing the principles of judicial economics versus those of fairness , you know ? We recognize , as agents of the court , that we have a duty to ensure proceedings are free of prejudice and undue bias . What the fuck are you talking about ? We left law school years ago . 
- What are you talking about ? - I 'm saying that we think a mistrial is justified . 
- Well , that 's all you had to say . - We oppose . 
You wanna keep going ? 
I 'm prepared to take over . 
- Immediately ? 
- You 're gonna take over ? 
Tomorrow . I 'd like a day . 
Mr. Delay Guardia ? 
Sorry . Yeah . Yeah . The prosecution stands ready to proceed . 
I 'd like to represent myself . 
I 'm sorry ? 
I 'd like to take over as lead counsel . My appearance is already on record and Ms. Winslow 's experience is more limited than my own . - No , a person cannot stand as a witness ... - She can serve as second chair . ... and an advocate in the same proceeding . I will not stand as a witness . I 'll stipulate that right now . You will be a witness . You 're gonna be the most clever witness of all time ' cause you 'll get to put your point of view and your demeanor to the jury ... 
- My lead counsel is incapacitated . - ... without facing cross-examination . I will not offer anything evidentiary or testimonial . And may I remind the court that it is my right . 
Then the court will remind you , Mr. Sabich , if you even hint at giving your version of events , I will allow prosecution to put you into that witness chair , where you will be subject to full cross-examination . 
And should you blow a hole in your foot , you will not be granted appeal on Sixth Amendment grounds of having a fool for an attorney . 
You 're gonna go pro per ? 
So long as he doesn 't give testimony , there 's no bar to it . 
I understand , Your Honor . 
Bad idea . But you 're free to indulge it . 
I 'll instruct the jury , and we shall resume tomorrow at 10 : 00 a.m. 
You might wanna rethink . 
How can this be ? You promised me that you would shield him . 
- We 'll do our best . - You 'll do your best ? You 'll do your best ? 
Is no one watching out for my son ? 
He will now be cross-examined by the very man who murdered his mother . 
- It is his right , right to represent ... 
- He 's a fucking murderer ! 
Even for a case involving such twists and turns , this is still a shocker . 
And , Eleanor , this whole idea of Rusty Sabich representing himself , - what are your thoughts on that ? - Mom , this is nuts . 
Don 't underestimate your father , honey . - Not in that room . 
- Mom , come on . - Come the fuck on . - Honey ! 
Stop ! Stop . 
All right , I 'll see you in there . 
Please excuse my tardiness , Your Honor . 
Mr. Sabich . 
Hello , Michael . First , let me offer my deep condolences . I cannot imagine the pain of losing your mom . 
You killed my mother . 
You used to go to your mother 's house a lot and just watch ? 
To see her life . To see the ... the life that she didn 't want you to be a part of . Yes . Did she ever tell you why she didn 't want you to be a part of her life ? 
No . Did your father ever tell you why she didn 't want to ? 
Well , that must have made you pretty angry . 
Is that a fair statement ? 
Not enough to kill her . Careful . 
- Raymond . 
- I 'm just watching . 
That 's interesting , Michael , ' cause in the last few weeks of her life , you had a number of text exchanges with your mother . 
Did you write her , " It would be easier if you were dead " ? Did you text her that ? 
She didn 't just hurt me . She hurt my father . " Just really fucking mad at you . You ruined my life . " 
Did you text her that ? 
You wished for her death . 
No , I said it would be easier . 
People move on from death . Divorce is harder . That 's what I meant . 
Okay . Leave it there . Just ... That 's good . 
You took this video of me entering your mother 's house on the night that she died , and you testified that you had seen me go there before . So you were aware that your mother and I were lovers . 
Yes . The idea that she didn 't want you in her life , but that she would have affection for me , that didn 't make you hate me at all ? 
I hate you because you killed her . 
Go easy , Rusty . 
So after you took this video , what did you do ? 
I left . And how long after you saw me enter her house did you leave ? 
- Pretty much right away . 
- And where did you go ? I went home . 
Who was at home ? My father . 
Just the two of you ? 
Yeah . Anybody else ? 
No , it was just us . 
So nobody to vouch for you but him . And nobody to vouch for him but you . 
- Objection . 
- Overruled . 
Did you tell your father that you saw your mother 's lover go into her house ? 
Please answer the question , Michael . 
I don 't remember if I told him anything . 
So it is possible ... it is possible that you told your father that you saw your mother 's lover go into her house the night that she was killed ? 
I don 't remember telling him anything . 
There are a number of documents that were confiscated by the police department on your computer . And it showed that you had a very keen interest in your mother 's past cases . 
You went on some true crime websites and you were digging for information that wasn 't available in the mainstream media , including Bunny Davis . - Objection . 
- Sustained . Ask questions , counsel . He 's got to be careful . 
- Did you kill your mother ? - Objection ! How about your father ? Did he kill your mother ? - Wow . - Tell me you have a good faith basis . 
I have grounds to accuse neither the witness or his father . How could I possibly ? After the briefest and most negligent of investigations by the police , they were both dismissed by the state attorney 's office ... 
- He 's out of control ... - Your Honor ! 
For the record , did you kill your mother ? Hey ! You sick fuck ! 
Dad ! 
- That 's enough ! Enough ! - Mr. Caldwell , step back . 
Are you fucking serious ? 
- Move . - Step back , Mr. Caldwell . 
You 're supposed to be watching him . 
Mr. Sabich , were you scared when Dalton Caldwell came after you ? 
You know , Raymond used to have this saying when a case went south . He 'd say there 's medium-rare fucked , there 's medium-plus , there 's well-done . 
I think we might be well-done fucked . 
He came off as desperate . He 's pointing the finger at everyone but himself . All right . All right . All right . 
So they established that somebody with hatred toward Carolyn Polhemus was at the scene who may have known details of the Bunny Davis case . 
They pinged Liam Reynolds and then the father , who went fucking psycho . 
So we ... we ... Rigo . - We call fucking Rigo . - Rigo ? - No , Rigo is firmly in Rusty 's camp . - Yeah . So was Eugenia . It 's all about asking the right questions . 
- Rigo hates me . 
- She doesn 't hate me . I can take her . - No . - Yeah . - Yeah . Yeah . - No . No , I 'll tell you why . ' Cause if we don 't , we 're well-done beyond-a-reasonable-doubt fucked . 
- What is Rigo going to say ? 
- I don 't know . 
No , come on . Bullshit . You two are friends . - Just tell me what she 's go ... - No , you two are friends . 
She is gonna testify to what ? 
Probably as to what I saw , Rusty , and what I 'm fucking seeing right now . 
What does that mean ? You 're fucking going rogue , like you are right here , right now . 
Wh ... You know I didn 't want to testify , right ? 
I know that you know that . 
Did I get this whole thing wrong ? 
- Did I get ... - What do ... Carolyn was a drug . You had an addiction . Addictions destroy lives . 
God . It 's one thing to destroy you , but you weren 't about to let her destroy your family . 
Oh , my God . I think she told you that night ... that she was gonna keep the baby , didn 't she ? 
Did she tell you that she was gonna keep the baby that night ? 
She was gonna keep that kid . - Your kid . - Get out of my car . 
Get out of my car . 
Liam Reynolds was not involved in Carolyn Polhemus 's murder , and yet the two of you went back to prison to see Liam Reynolds . - Is that right ? - We did . 
Why ? 
We 'll let Rusty tell us . 
Even if you did have Carolyn killed , it could work in your favor . 
You 'd have to have an accomplice , which means you 'd have something to trade . Okay , so just imagine , right now , you 're serving a life sentence for killing Bunny Davis . But by pointing us to Carolyn , you could possibly see the street again , you know ? Or even if you had a hand in the murder too . 
Now that is perversity . 
So , just to be clear , you 're telling me incriminating myself ... - If you had an accomplice . - ... in a prosecutor 's murder , - could lead to my freedom ? - Yes . 
What 's certain is that you are currently serving a life sentence without parole . And I am offering you an opportunity to change that . 
This is beautiful . No ! God Almighty . 
I just ... I had no fucking idea . 
You 're desperate . 
A reduced sentence in return for confessing to Carolyn Polhemus 's murder . 
I wasn 't present . I didn 't know he was gonna do that . 
Did you take issue with this attempted bribe ? Objection ! 
- Sustained . - I apologize . Did you take issue with this approach ? 
I did . When he told me what happened , I said I thought he way crossed the line . 
And did he respond ? 
Yeah , he said something to the effect of ... It 's my life on the line . I 'll do whatever I have to . 
What a hero . When you were first assigned this case by the defendant , were you given any particular directives as to the collection of evidence ? 
All evidence , forensics and otherwise , was to go straight to him and only him . 
And were you given any particular directives as to whom the evidence and the forensics and otherwise should be particularly shielded from ? 
Mr. Molto and you . 
That 's disappointing . 
Your witness . 
Here we go . 
I was desperate to prove my innocence , at all times , of charges that I felt wrongly accused of . Is that a fair statement ? Okay . And I steadfastly maintained my innocence in the death of Carolyn Polhemus at all times . 
- Did I not ? 
And in your experience , Detective , is it unusual for a prosecutor to ask you to keep information between the two of them ? 
In my experience , no , it 's not . 
And you 're aware that I asked you to keep the evidence between the two of us precisely because I did not trust that Mr. Molto or Mr. Della Guardia would conduct a fair investigation . Is that also a fair statement ? 
Thank you . 
How are you doing ? 
Yeah , you know , they ... they pulled up two witnesses to assert my ... And I was a little too zealous in my assertion of my innocence . 
You know , whatever . So what ? Case is still good . We 're good . You went back to using these ? 
I mean , I need to focus . 
How am I supposed to do that ? 
You just should 've told me , Rusty . 
- So good . So good . Yeah . - Oh , yeah . Thank you . 
All rise . 
The court is now in session . The honorable Judge Lyttle presiding . Be seated . 
Okay then , Mr. Molto . Does the State have anything else ? 
Yes , Your Honor . 
The People call Rusty Sabich . 
What the fuck was that ? 
Well , since Mr. Sabich insisted on testifying through Detective Rodriguez , it 's only fair that he be sworn in and subjected to cross . 
I didn 't hear an objection . 
I didn 't feel the need to , as the court made it very clear if the defendant even hinted at his version ... No , I did not testify . I cross-examined a witness that you called . 
But you went beyond the scope of our direct . You asserted your innocence . 
You called the witness and you called the detective to establish my guilt and my dishonesty , and my cross went to my truthfulness and innocence , well within my scope of direct . 
You gave your version . 
I warned you , should you even introduce even a morsel of something that 's not in evidence ... You did exactly that . 
All right , you got two choices . 
You want a mistrial , I 'll give you one . No questions asked . 
I won 't force you to go on . But if we do go on , you get in that chair . 
You opened the door on this . 
Take the mistrial , Rusty . 
I 'll testify . 
- Mya , they wanted a mistrial . - The fuck was that ? - They know they 're losing . - No . - That 's why they called me ! - Maybe . Or maybe they wanted to get you on the stand , where you 'll be an easy fucking target . 
Fine , put me in the witness chair . Fine . Let 's have Molto 's narcissism - on full display . - Why ? And yours won 't ? What is that supposed to mean ? 
Did you do it on purpose ? 
- What ? - Open the door . 
- What do you think ... - You introduced testimony . - Did you do it on purpose ? - No ... Why would I do that ? 
' Cause you 're Rusty Sabich , and you can do whatever you want , right ? 
Mya , maybe ... just maybe ... I did it because I know what the fuck I 'm doing . 
I don 't think so . 
I 'm done . 
So , Rusty Sabich is expected to take the stand in his own defense , which means that he 'll not only be a defendant , he 'll be an advocate . He 's also gonna be a witness as well . What ? 
He is not going to be having a second chair , which means that he is going to be flying solo . 
A lot resting on his shoulders in this trial . It feels like Sabich has really found himself backed into a corner . And I don 't know if anything short of a miracle ... Oh , God , Rusty . ... is going to be able to get him out of it . 
Pills . What kind of pills ? 
- He 's taking Ritalin . 
- Are you serious ? Yeah , I heard Mom on the phone with her therapist , and I guess he 's taken it before for big trials . 
Makes him sharper . Yeah . 
And he 's taking it now before he testifies tomorrow ? 
Yeah , it 's fucking stupid . 
Is it possible to have some of that Rusty Sabich fairy dust ? 
I don 't know if it 's something I can give you . 
Please tell me you didn 't spend the whole night here . 
No , I came in early . 
All right . You ready ? 
Yeah , I 'm ready . 
Great . So , big day . 
I was just thinking about law school and how hard we worked . 
Yeah , just give me one day , Nico . One day , when I can just say it was all worth it . 
Today is that day , Tommy . 
It is like Crime Junkie 101 . You don 't take the stand in your own defense . 
Well , he didn 't , right ? The prosecution called him ... How do you represent yourself without looking like a schizophrenic ? 
Something that could create doubt in the minds of the jury . 
Hello , Mya . 
Good luck today . I just wanted to say the key is to not let him rattle you , which will be his intent . 
To get you to flare . You can 't take the bait . 
Thank you , Mya . 
Am I allowed to give more general advice ? 
Can I say that I 'm sorry first ? 
Apology accepted . 
Maybe you were right . 
I 'm always right . 
Don 't let him let you be an asshole . 
It would not be good for the jury to see you in that light . 
Don 't cede to them on anything . 
- I 'll be there , Rusty . 
- Okay , someone 's here . - I gotta go . Thank you , Mya . - Okay . 
- What are you doing here ? 
- Doctors cleared me . 
You need me . 
Are you sure that it 's safe to be in the courtroom ? 
Really . Doctors , they say I 'm good . You ? 
Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? - I do . 
- Have a seat . 
Mr. Sabich ... you stated that you maintained your innocence at all times with Detective Rodriguez . 
- Correct . 
- And that was truthful ? 
It was . You were truthful with her about everything ? 
I did not disclose my relationship with the victim . 
Did you disclose to her that you were present at the victim 's house on the night of ? 
- Eventually . - Eventually ? 
So when you first assigned this case to Detective Rodriguez in your capacity as Chief Deputy Prosecutor , did you tell her that you were present at the scene of the crime on the night of ? 
I did not . Did you tell anyone that was connected to the case ? 
I did not kill her . 
Are the first 48 hours the most important in any investigation ? 
And would it have been helpful for the police and the investigatory team to just know that you were there ? 
You made your point , Tommy . 
I did not disclose my presence . 
- Were you in love with her ? - I fell in love with her . 
Is it fair to say you were obsessed with her ? 
I was in love with her . As to what qualifies as obsession ... Sending 30 texts or emails on or near the day of her death . - Would that qualify ? - I was in love with her . 
On the night of her death , you went there hoping that she would take you back ? 
I did . 
Did you send these texts in the hours before her death ? 
" This is not right . You can 't do this . 
I 'll not let you treat me this way . Answer my fucking calls . " 
- You sent those ? - I did . And how about this one ? " I want to spend the rest of my life with you . " 
Did you send Carolyn that text ? Did you tell her you wanted to spend the rest of your life with her ? 
I was in love with her . 
- Were you angry with her ? 
- I was frustrated . 
Frustrated , like this text ? 
" Answer my fucking calls . Who the fuck do you think you are , treating me this way ? " 
Is that frustration or would that qualify as anger ? 
It would qualify as passion . 
And passion can blind a person . And I certainly lost sight of the things that were most important in my life . My wife and my children . 
Passion is a dangerous drug . One that you 're not immune to yourself , Tommy . 
So consumed with trying to take me down that you have lost sight of the fact that you have no real evidence . 
Yes , I was in love with her . Yes , I did not disclose my presence , but I did not kill her . 
- Did you strike her with a fire poker ? - I never hit her . 
I am not a violent person . 
Mr. Ratzer , could you please stand ? 
Have you ever encountered this person before ? 
There is a context to that . 
This is footage from the adjacent house to yours . 
The two of you , correct ? 
Does that fairly and accurately capture the context ? 
Your Honor , this is unfair surprise . 
Offer to impeach . The witness just testified that he 's not violent . 
I 'll allow it . 
He came to my house uninvited . 
He trespassed and he intimidated me . 
So you beat him up ? 
I am guilty of acting out of desperation . 
It caused me to hide my relationship with Carolyn Polhemus . It caused me to zealously pursue an admission from Liam Reynolds in her death . It caused me to lash out at Brian Ratzer . By the way , when he came to my house and he violently banged on my door when my daughter answered . 
Am I volatile ? Yes . Yes , I 'm volatile . 
A person I loved was brutally murdered . And I have been charged with that crime . 
And circumstances like that can bring out many things in a person , desperation being one of them . Weakness , emotional instability . And I apologize for all of those things . 
I am guilty of all of those things . But what I am not guilty of is killing Carolyn Polhemus . 
I did not take her life . 
Yeah . What about Dr. Kumagai ? 
Did you ever try to strangle our chief medical examiner ? 
- You want me to repeat the question ? 
- No , I heard the question . It was brought to my attention that he had concealed evidence in another case . I mean , or at least improperly failed to make me aware of it . And so things got heated between the two of us and ... I regretfully got physical . 
You regretfully tried to choke him . No , I did not choke him . Okay , when tempers flared - and you grabbed him by the throat ... - By the lapel . Okay , when tempers flared and you grabbed him by the lapel , did you decide to do that or did you just snap ? 
I 'm not sure what the question is . 
Did you decide to do that or did you just snap ? 
How about Mr. Ratzer , when you repeatedly punched him as we saw in the video ? Did you decide to do that or did you just snap ? 
He would not leave . 
What would you do ? What would you do ? 
So you snapped . 
Hey , look at me . Look at me . 
That was extraordinary . 
This is torture . 
It 's fucking torture . 
I just spend all my days lying to my family . 
When I 'm with them , all I wanna do is be with you . 
The rest of your life , huh ? 
I don 't remember writing that . Just a line ? 
Dare I ask , what now ?
