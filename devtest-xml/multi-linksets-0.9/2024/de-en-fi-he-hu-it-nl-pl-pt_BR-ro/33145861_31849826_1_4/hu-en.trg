- We 've constructed a paradise here ... but the world is still the world . 
- Defib ! 
- I don 't have a pulse . 
- Max . 
He 's gone . 
- I spoke to the captain , and if you wanted . if you decided that you would like to be an M.D. , he will support you for a full scholarship . 
- It was never real . 
I was never in love with Avery to begin with . 
- I think I just heard you give me your inherent blessing . 
Is it a bad idea ? 
- Sleeping with a subordinate ? 
- Alright , you scallywags . The heat 's on . Bets are in . Let 's draw . 
- If this were Settlers of Catan , I 'm telling you ... whole different story . 
- Mm-hmm . - I 'll trade two . 
- Two please , Cap . 
- So , we all jazzed for " Welles-ness Week " with Bethany Welles ? 
I had to Zoom with her two weeks ago . Bethany asked me , the head of housekeeping , to personally wash all the linens in her own special detergent made from pickled cucumber brine . 
- Aren 't pickled cucumbers just pickles ? 
- This woman is a wellness celebrity . 
She has no idea about what we do , and yet , for a week , we give her the keys to the kingdom . 
It 's like putting a toddler behind a Mack truck and saying , " Happy trails . " 
- Why on Earth would we give this woman that much power ? 
- Oh , naive little Dr. Odyssey . 
There are exactly 10.2 million reasons why . 
- Instagram followers . 
- Her company sponsors this Wellness Week . 
And it 's a very public , very big deal , so we kind of have a little balancing act here . 
We do our jobs while simultaneously tolerating Bethany 's wackadoodle quirks . 
- Last year , she tried to get me to use corn ethanol to power the ship . 
Corn . I tell you , this whole , uh , " global warming " crap is just so overblown . 
- Global warming is overblown ? 
Just this week , we 'll re-routing around a major tropical depression off the coast of Baja . 
Tell me , when have we ever had tropical depressions in this time of year ? 
- Well , if the Earth 's getting so hot , then you just explain to me why there was 8 feet of flipping snow last Christmas in my hometown of Dowagiac , Michigan . 
- Rosie , I 'm gonna tell you , you 're the best damn engineer that a captain could ever ask for and nobody knows this Odyssey better than you , but on this point , you 're dead wrong . 
I 've been on the seas for the better part of my life and sailed every ocean in every condition . And I can tell ya , from my experience , this isn 't right . 
These storms are stronger and the hurricane seasons last months longer than they used to . 
But speaking of disasters , it 's time for the rest of you fools to lose your clothing . 
- Good . - Who 's still in ? - I 'm out like Ellen . 
Ohh ! - Rosie , you can smell that thing in Buenaventura . 
- Uh , yeah . I 'm out , Cap . You got me , too . 
- Fold , but ... 
Well , joke 's on you . I 'm an exhibitionist . - Ha ha ah ! 
There he is ! 
- Well , look , first I want to just say thank you for inviting me to the Boys and Butches card game . 
- And " Bi 's . " - Sorry . Boys , Butches , and Bi 's . 
And in that spirit of inclusion , I would like to say ... 
I 'm in . - Really ? 
- Really . 
Three cowboys . 
Ooh ! - " How rude " is the catchphrase of Stephanie Tanner on my favorite sitcom ... - Oh ! Come on . 
Come on ! - ... " Full House . " 
- Why not the ... - The hat always stays on . 
Well , that 's game for me . 
Remember ... this week , chins up . 
We can navigate around any rough waters , and we can navigate around the peculiarities of Bethany Welles . 
So no tropical depressions , either atmospheric or emotional , are gonna darken our days . 
I forecast smiles and smooth sailing and sunny skies ! 
- Are we still on course ? 
- Barely maintaining . - Alright , team . We 're entering the first trough . 
Alright . Brace for impact . - Brace ! 
- So I got a letter yesterday , and , uh ... Well , uh , I got it . 
Yeah . - That 's amazing ! - Thank you ! Oh , congratulations ! 
Thanks . - You 're gonna be a doctor . You 're going to med school . You 're leaving . 
- Y-Yeah . Yeah . 
I guess so . - Wow . - Yeah . - Man , I 'm so happy for you . That 's great . - Thank you . 
Hey . Should we ... - Do you want to ... - Well , I just wanted to check in and make sure if you wanted to talk about what happened , but ... - Uh , I mean , I don 't have to talk about what happened . 
Do you want to talk about what happened ? - Oh . No , no . Then I ... 
If you 're good , I 'm good . - We 're great . - Okay . 
We 're good . - Yeah . That 's good . 
Well , congratulations . I-I 'm really happy for you . 
Oh , my God ! That 's Agnes Simkin ! She 's an acupuncturist and a psychic . 
She 's helped thousands of people diagnose chronic conditions . - Unbelievable . 
Why rely on the scientific method when you can just read your patient 's palm ? 
- You both really think Western medicine has everything figured out ? 
- Well , all I know is that when I get sick , I go to a doctor for some pills , not a witch for some toadstools . 
- Taxus brevifolia . A.k.a. the Pacific yew tree . 
Its bark contains paclitaxel , better known as Taxol , the life-saving chemotherapy drug . 
Practitioners were called crazy when they first started using it as a cancer treatment . 
- Yeah , but maybe for this week , we don 't use that word ... " crazy . " 
Buenos dias ! Muy bueno to be back ! 
Bienvenida , Bethany . 
Todo es bien . Look at those sapphire eyes . Oh ! You 're just so handsome ! 
I came bearing gifts . 
- That 's so nice . - And you get a prize . - Thank you . 
- And you get a prize . And you get a prize . 
- Thank you . - Captain ! 
- And , Captain ... - Uh ... 
Oh . I 'm sorry . 
Do you know what this is ? 
Ozone therapy . 
- Where does that tube go ? 
- It 's a rectal application . 
Wellness culture . It 's my agony . It 's my ecstasy . 
Sue me . - Avery ! Oh , my radiant daughter ! Look at you ! 
- You know , it 's time to cut that thing out of your life . And I know you know what I 'm talking about . 
- Yes , yes . - We 'll talk later about it . 
You must be the doctor ! 
Your aura . It 's a crimson , bloody shadow ! 
- Hi . Hi . - Huh ? - Sorry . - Ohh . 
I can 't believe it 's really you ! I 'm crying ! 
Oh , bless you . 
May our tears , as carriers of truth , flow ceaselessly . 
- Can I get a selfie ? 
- You better post it . Right ? 
Okay . Rowan ! 
- Tag B. Welles Health and Beauty for 10 % off at our onboard store . 
The ship has called to me like a great spirit beckoning . 
- May she nestle you securely in her mighty bosom . - Oh . 
Ohh ! Everyone , I 'd like you to meet my dear , dear friend , Vivian Montgomery , whom you may recognize if you own a television . 
That 's right . Viv is a two-time winner of " Red-Hot Chef , " and she will be overseeing our cuisine this week . 
Oh , her liver carpaccio is to die for ! 
- Personal chef to a bunch of smoothie drinkers . 
Sweet gig . - Coming from a candy striper on a cruise ship ? 
Um , Bethany , what 's all this ? 
- Oh , did I forget to tell you ? Oops . 
Might I wrangle the doctor for just a squeak ? 
I just have some tiny micro details to go over just for pesky insurance purposes . 
- Wrangle away . 
My lawyers , the nervous ninnies , demanded a doctor sign off on some of my cuisine choices . 
You know , liability , yada yada yada . 
You know , I 've been on this incredible diet for the past six months and I 've never felt better . 
Viv , tell him all about it ! - It 's organ meats , nature 's multivitamin . 
They 're rich in iron , copper , vitamins A , B. Low in cholesterol and full of protein . Here . 
Try it . This is goat liver . 
The flavor is smooth , delicate , and it 's easily digestible . 
- Are you asking me to eat that ? 
- Obviously . 
- No . Raw meat is filled with bacteria , pathogens , parasites . 
Why don 't we cook it first ? - No You 'll ruin it 
That 's the food of our ancestors . 
You know , they didn 't have expensive flambÃ © pans or fancy polyurethane sous vide bags . 
No , they took a raw bite , they chewed , they swallowed , and they thrived . 
- And they lived to the ripe old age of 22 . 
- You eat sushi , right ? 
What 's the difference ? 
Come on , Doc . What are you afraid of ? 
- I 'll eat it . 
- Tristan . So nice of you to join us . 
Sh ... 
Happy to help . Wow . That looks ... looks lovely . 
- Thank you . - Mmm . - See ? Nothing to be afraid of . 
I 'm having Vivian include a special course with tonight 's dinner ... with your go-ahead , Doctor . - I don 't see the harm . What say you , Doc ? 
- Sure , but I want a member of my team to oversee the food-prep process . 
I don 't want there to be any cross-contamination . 
Tristan , you seem to have taken a keen interest . 
- Oh , yeah . 
Whatever you say . 
- You hear that ? You 're mine . 
- Dearie me . 
- How y 'all doing ? I 'm Judy Riva the Smoothie Diva , and I 'm joined today by healer extraordinaire 
Now , organic ingredients mixed properly ... this is nature 's medicine . 
- Hm . - So I put all the good stuff in one powder ... DivaDust . 
Now , this is my proprietary blend of superfoods , minerals , and pre - and probiotics . 
What 's in it ? She won 't tell me . She never has . 
- Well , I can 't tell you . If I tell you that , my lawyers will have you walk the gangplank . 
- I have a crazy legal team , as well . 
Hm . - What I can tell you is that this mixture literally erased my son 's dyslexia . 
And for me , it cured a terrible case of chronic hiccups . 
Uh , you know , three years ago , Judy came to me and she said , " Eat my dust , " in that very brash tone of hers . 
Um , but I have to say , I 'm so glad that I did , really . Because I start every morning with a DivaDust smoothie . 
And I know it 's hard to tell in this tunic , but I 'm quite thin . 
So the proof is in the pudding , as they say . 
- Yes . The proof is in the dust . 
I have , along with DivaDust , a couple of incredible ingredients which are not even legal in the U.S. - Um , including bitter almonds . 
These guys have twice the nutrients and way more flavor than the regular old ones at the supermarket . 
- Excuse me . Can we get a picture with you ? - Oh . 
- Uh , Miss Simkin ? 
Um , I 'm Avery . I 'm a nurse here on the Odyssey , and I just wanted to say I 'm a huge fan . 
- It 's a shame to see such a young and promising woman working for the enemy . 
Big Pharma ? 
The sickness industrial complex ? 
Doctors and nurses , like yourself , have a vested interest in keeping people sick . 
True wellness comes from within , not without . 
- Um , I-I don 't ... I don 't think that 's fair at all , actually . 
I-I swore an oath to help people that I take very seriously . A-Are you ... Uh , are you okay ? 
I 'm fine , sweetie . I 'm an empath . 
I probably picked up on a rogue emotion of yours . 
Perhaps guilt . 
Miss Simkin ? 
- 1027 on the pool deck . We need a stretcher , stat ! 
What the hell was in that smoothie ? 
- Let 's get her cuffed up . - No ... No tech . I 'm tech-adverse . No . Get it off . 
- Prep 5 grams of hydroxocobalamin . 
- Poisoned by bitter almonds ? T-That 's impossible ! 
They 're organic . - Yeah . 
So is arsenic . Bitter almonds contain amygdalin , which breaks down into hydrogen cyanide when ingested in high doses . 
- Be ready to initiate ACLS procedures . 
- If I 'm gonna be subjected to this Western medical torture , I at least need to be able to breathe ! 
- I 'm gonna get you some oxygen right now . 
- No , no , sweetie , no . Allow my ... my body to breathe . 
- Doctor ... 
- Spider angiomas . 
- Avery , this isn 't cyanide poisoning . It 's not the almonds . 
- Well , I hate to say I told you so . 
- What else is in those smoothies ? 
- I can 't tell you that . That 's ... That 's proprietary . 
I mean , that 's like telling you the recipe for Coca-Cola . 
She 's seizing ! 
Let 's get her oxygen now ! 
- It 's just a thickener ! Ashwagandha root . B complex vitamins . A Tara powder base . 
- Tara powder ? 
Prep for emergency dialysis now . 
Prep the machine . We 're aiming for a bicarbonate dialysate . 
Start at a flow rate of 300 milliliters a minute . 
- Got it . - Monitoring for disequilibrium syndrome . 
Tara powder . How did you know what that was ? 
- When I was working for Doctors Without Borders in Peru , we would get cases of kids who were accidentally eating the seed pods from the tara tree , which is toxic to the liver , and they also bind to proteins , making it impossible for the body to absorb them . 
She 'll be fine in a few days . 
- Explains why people who drink the smoothies feel full but still lose weight . 
They 're developing malnutrition . Nice . 
- Hey , gents . 
- Say what you will about her , Bethany Welles puts together a hell of a gift bag . 
Care for a saltwater taffy made with Indian Ocean saltwater ? 
- Munroe , when I was 18 years old , I worked a clam trawler out of Atlantic City , and ever since then , that taffy tastes like broken heart and permanent sunburn . 
Tell me about this tropical depression . 
- She 's taking the usual route up the coast ... northwest to west-northwest . 
If we stay the course , we should only encounter the outer bands . 
Shouldn 't get much choppier than this . - Alright . Good . 
I 'm still gonna want some up-to-minute reports from the National Hurricane Center . 
Give me some bridge-to-bridge comms and forecasting models from OWS and GFS . 
Anything changes , we 'll just turn this puppy around and make port in Baja . 
Meanwhile , let 's smooth this damn ride out . 
- Sir . 
Bridge to Control Room . Activate stabilizers . - Control Room copies . 
Activating stabilization system . 
- Folks , this is your captain coming to you from the bridge . 
Now , out on the ocean , as in life , it 's not a question of when you 're gonna encounter waves . It 's , what do you do when they come up ? 
And here on the Odyssey , when the waves come a-rockin ' ... we start rockin ' and rollin ' . 
- Not so much . - Yes , Chef . 
- You call that a julienne ? 
- â  ª Riders on the storm - I call that a carrot . 
- Well ... you 're hopeless . 
- I really am . 
- Back to work ! 
- Yes , Chef . 
- Hey , Bethany . Is everything okay ? 
- Absolutely not ! 
My beef hearts taste like organ meat ! 
Something is off . 
- I 'm so sorry to hear that . 
The meat is fresh . 
It 's emulsified with capers , shallots , anchovy paste . 
It 's the same as always . - Listing the ingredients doesn 't help , Viv ! 
Clearly we made a mistake ! 
You know , you 're a talented cook , but it takes a real brilliant chef to work at this scale . 
Alright ? Just get rid of it . Take it away . And do that thing I like with the Spam and the mozzarella and mix it up so it looks like tartare . 
- Okay ? Can you do that ? 
- That 's cooking 101 ! - Of course . 
- What ? 
We 're friends . 
You 're " friends " ? 
I thought you were trying to not do this . 
- Do what ? 
- I support whatever you 're doing or not doing . 
She 's talented , successful . 
Maybe this thing has legs . 
It 's got legs . 
Long ones . Her food is awful . 
I can 't eat this . 
- For whatever it 's worth , my liver mousse is really tasty . 
- Yeah , well , it 's making me nauseous . 
- Then go have a Hot Pocket in your cabin ! 
- You know what ? 
- No . Nope . We 're not doing this again . 
No more drama in the infirmary . 
Go quash whatever that is right now . 
- Looks like we 're on the other side of that storm system . 
What is your problem ? 
Are you jealous or something ? 
Of you and ... 
No , babe , I 'm not jealous . 
You rejected me . 
And now that I 'm moving on and I 've found someone that I actually like , it 's making you crazy . 
What ? 
She 's nice and she 's smart . She 's an extremely good cook . 
- She literally doesn 't cook . 
That 's her whole thing . She 's a talking Cuisinart ... - Hey , guys . - Ah ... 
- Ah , imagine coming out onto the deck ... only to find people talking about you . 
Not cool . 
I 'm going to bed . I feel sick . - Have a bit too much Zinfandel ? 
- No , actually . I had a lot of whatever you made tonight . - Hey . Cut it out . Knock it off over there . 
We got bigger fish to fry . 
We 're not on the other side of this storm . We 're in the eye of it . 
Damn thing must have built up around us . 
Brandon , give me your walkie . 
- Captain Massey to the bridge . 
Munroe , what 's it look like on the Doppler ? 
First Officer Munroe , come in . 
Psilocybin . 
Beautiful . 
- What ... - What 's going on , Cap ? 
- Well , Munroe , what 's going on is you 're higher than Snoop D-O Double G ... and we 're in the middle of a hurricane , maybe one of the worst 
I 've ever seen in this part of the Pacific . High ? - Yeah . 
- I 'm high ? What ? - Yeah . 
You 're alright . You didn 't get into that , did you ? - No , sir . 
- That 's one in a row . 
- Folks , this is your captain calling from the bridge deck with an update . 
Well , it appears that Mother Nature has decided to come along for the ride this week . 
As calm as it may seem right now , we are actually in the eye of a hurricane . 
The worst of the storm could hit in a few hours or a day . 
Remain calm and await further announcement . 
I told you there was something wrong with that food ! 
Avery , you in there ? 
You okay ? 
- I 'm not leaving until I see whatever ingenious thing you 've fashioned into a barf bucket . 
- It 's from the nursery . 
It 's for sandcastles . 
Okay . Infirmary . Come on . Let 's go . 
- I have food poisoning . Just let me cocoon in privacy . 
- How do you know it 's food poisoning ? 
- Oh , because I am a very good nurse , Maxwell . 
Abdominal pain , vomiting , and , oh , yeah , eating a plateful of raw meat . 
- Is it a broad pain or a sharp , persistent pain ? 
- You are a sharp , persistent pain . 
We don 't self-diagnose . Them 's the rules . 
Infirmary ! Come on ! - No . I can hardly stand . 
How do you expect me to walk to the infirmary ? 
- Purify the space ! To create a better place ! 
Purify the space ! Put it on your face ! 
- I leave for five minut ... Are you burning sage ? ! 
Purify the space ! - Hey , Tristan . - Yeah ? - You call that in to the bridge , make sure they know there 's nothing on fire down here . 
- Way ahead of you . She showed up and started babbling about healing rituals . 
- Need a hand over here with Avery . I need her vitals and put her on ... - 500-mil saline bag . 4 milligrams ondansetron for nausea ? 
- My guy . And for pain ? 
- Ozone . 
- No , I was gonna say Toradol , but ... - No . 
She 's inhaling the ozone . 
- Oh , God ! Bethany ! No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! 
We do not inhale the ozone . 
That 's toxic . Okay . Hi , Bethany . Hi . Hi . Hi . I 'm gonna need to take your vitals . Okay ? - Mm-hmm . 
- Stick with me for one sec . 
- I can do this . 
- Dr. Odyssey ! - Hey , Tristan . - Yeah ? - I need a CBC and a tox screen . 
I think she might have ingested something . 
- Yeah , a spoonful of bath salts maybe ? 
- Also prep some Ativan . We 're gonna do a grab-and-stab . - Grab-and-stab . - Hi , Bethany . Hi . Hi . 
How you doing ? 
Deep breaths . One breath . Two breath . 
Three deep ... Three deep breaths . 
- Sleep well , B. Welles . 
- Let 's get her in some straps , just in case . 
We 're back with you . 
- Alright . What happens when you palpate your right side ? 
Rebound pain . 
Okay . It 's not food poisoning . It 's either , um ... It 's kidney stones , diverticulitis ... - Or appendicitis . 
- Appendicitis ? Do we have time to do tests , a CT scan ? 
- No , but we don 't need to . 
Are you familiar with RPO procedure ? - Nuh-unh . 
- There are three checks . 
One , pain in the lower-right quadrant . You 've already exhibited that . 
Two pain when the right leg is flexed . Check . Three , pain when the hip is put into interior rotation . - Ow ! 
Check , check , check ! 
Ding , ding , ding ! Max , I think you 're gonna have to operate . 
Ooh ! It feels like it 's gonna rupture ! 
- Yeah , I told you . I told you . I told you it wasn 't food poisoning . 
Why won 't you listen to me , Aves ? 
- All guests , please return to your cabins . 
- Well , we 've outrun her about as long as we can . 
Rosie , set speed to 120 RPMs . 
Helmsman , adjust your heading to 045 degrees . 
Set condition Zebra . 
All hands , prepare for heavy weather . 
Secure all openings . 
I want this ship drier than Rosie 's stories about growing up in Dowagiac . 
- Roger that . But you live for my stories , Cap ! 
- Engage heeling pumps on starboard to counteract portside list . 
- Good idea , Tim Leary . 
Did you get that , Rosie ? Heard it and on it . 
- Folks , this is the Captain coming from the bridge deck . 
Well ... It 's a funny thing about being surrounded on all sides . The only way out is through . 
Go to your cabins , secure your belongings , and brace for rough water . 
- Infirmary to Bridge . Captain , you there ? 
- Yeah , Max . What do you need ? 
- Honestly , I need a miracle . 
It 's Avery . Her appendix is about to burst . We need to do emergency surgery . 
I need 20 minutes of calm waters . 
- Is that 20 consecutive minutes ? 
- I 'll take ' em how I can get ' em . 
- Alright . Stay calm . 
Avery 's in good hands with you and Tristan , and you 're in good hands with me and the bridge crew up here . 
I 'm gonna get you that 20 minutes , but it 's not gonna be all at once . 
It 's gonna take the better part of the next hour . 
I got an idea . It 's an old seamen 's maneuver . 
It violates about 50 nautical laws ... but we 'll deal with that later . 
The only thing you have to do is stay calm and follow my instructions to the letter . Can you do it ? - Yes , sir . 
- Alright . This is how " trough riding " works . 
We 're gonna navigate this storm in a big zig-zag pattern . 
I 'm gonna position the ship in the trough of a wave , and that should carry us along for a couple minutes . 
When we absolutely have to , I 'll give warning and we 'll make a hard 90-degree turn , thrust through the wave and into the next trough , which should buy us a couple more minutes . 
- So instead of steady rocking , we 'll have moments of calm followed by " Whoa , mama , hang on to your hat ! " 
That 's exactly right , Rosie . Guys , the life of one of our own is on the line down there . 
The only way this works is if we stay in constant contact and communication . 
Copy ? 
- Yes , sir . - Copy that . 
- How am I supposed to pull this off , huh ? Without you bossing me around ? 
- Just remember ... if you kill me , my ghost is gonna come crop-dust you every time you 're alone with a girl . 
- Intubating now . - Alright , team . We 're entering the first trough . 
- Cutting along the McBurney line now . 
Access . 
Locating the appendix . 
- Got it . - Time 's up ! I gotta make the turn ! 
- One sec , Cap ! 
- Don 't have it . Brace now . 
- Watch it . 
If those hit the ground , they 're useless . 
- Yeah . There it is . 
- Clamp . 
- Brace for impact . 
- Sir , the wind . It 's changing direction on us . 
- We got a rogue wave coming . Get ready . Brace yourself now ! 
- Ligatures are loose . I got uncontrolled bleeding . 
I need visualization , stat . 
Yeah . We 're good . 
- We 're okay , Cap . We lost you there . But we 're okay . All three of us . 
- Well , I 'm glad to hear it . 
It 's not over yet , but I think we 're through the worst of it . 
- It 's still too shaky . I can 't get the sutures to stick . 
- Can I ? 
- Got it . 
- We call this the " cruise ship knot . " 
It 's the same as a square knot , but you double the back loops . 
You see ? 
Scissors . 
- That 's actually ... very smart . 
- Well ... I do know some things , Doc . 
That was fun ! 
Wanna do it again ? 
- Whoo ! That 's what I 'm talking about , baby ! 
- Hey , Tristan ... You know a lot more than some things . 
That was incredible work . 
I wouldn 't have wanted anybody else in there with me . 
- Her blood pressure 's dropping . Heartbeat 's irregular . 
- Looks like she vomited during the storm . 
Let 's get her on her side so she doesn 't aspirate . - Yeah . - Ready ? One . Two . Three . 
- Do you think it 's drugs ? Hallucinogenic therapy ? - I 'm not so sure . Look at her wrists . 
Swelling . Yellowing of the fingernails . 
- Jaundice . 
Something to do with her liver . 
Such negative auras . 
- That 's what she said to me when we first met . I had a " crimson aura . " 
Bingo . 
Kayser-Fleischer rings . - Uh , w-what ? 
- It 's copper poisoning . 
Y-You see the rust-colored rings around her Iris ? 
- That 's why she 's seeing auras . Her vision 's clouded . 
It also explains the neurological symptoms and the ataxia . 
Organ meat ... extremely high in heavy metals . And liver is high in copper . 
She needs chelation therapy . We need to detox her system . 
Let 's get her on an I.V. of penicillamine . - Yeah . - Ondansetron for nausea . 
- I got it . 
Energy meridians run like streams through the body . 
Strong emotions muddy the waters , pollute the soul . 
- Agnes , are you sure you 're ready to do this ? 
I mean , I thought I killed you . 
- Sweetie , it 's gonna take more than a smoothie to get rid of me . 
Hm ! - I 'm closing up shop . 
I 've blended my last bebida . 
- Judy , sweetie , you 're a healer , for Goddess ' sake . 
You can 't quit that easy . 
Did I ever tell you about that pro golfer whose shoulder I was working on ? 
I can 't say who he is , of course , but let 's just say he was a real " big cat " if you catch my drift . It was Tiger Woods . Yeah . 
I was tapping his Yunmen , the cloud gate , but I was a millimeter off . 
He lost sensation in his whole arm a week before the Masters . 
Gradually over the next six days , sensation returned . And that weekend , he shot 18 below par , took home the Green Jacket . 
It 's amazing what miracles can happen with catastrophe . 
I 'm sensing a real imbalance right here in your Tianliao . 
Yeah . Inhale deeply for me . 
That one felt kind of funny . 
- Oh , yeah . That 's toxicity leaving the body . 
Now exhale all that negativity . 
- Judy , does it hurt when you breathe ? - Yes . 
- Her lips are turning blue . 
Central cyanosis . 
O2 SATS are at 88 % . She needs oxygen . 
- How long are these needles ? 
- Uh , they range . The black ones are 100 millimeters . 
- 100 millimeters ? 
The intrapleural space is 25 millimeters , so what you 've done here is punctured her lung . Now all the air is rushing out into her chest cavity and it 's crushing her heart and lungs . 
- O2 SATS are at 70 . 
- Prep for a thoracostomy . 
I 'm gonna get these needles out now . - No ! No , no , no ! 
Are you crazy ? ! If you interrupt her treatment now , you could permanently alter her energy pathways ! 
What she needs is to breathe through this . 
- The only way she 's breathing through this is through a chest tube . 
- Judy , when I tell you , I 'm gonna need you to breathe out all the air in your lungs and hold it . Okay ? 
Scalpel . 
Ready ? 
- Okay . 
This is gonna hurt a little . 
Drape . - Okay . - Finish dressing the wound . 
Monitor her vitals . I 'm gonna go check on Avery . 
- She 's fine . She 's better than ever , actually . 
She needed this . 
She needed this . 
- You ! 
Me . 
I must say . This is feeling very " Gift of the Magi . " 
- Is that that story about the poor husband and wife who try to buy each other the perfect Christmas present ? 
She sells her hair to buy him a watch chain . He sells his watch to buy her a comb . 
- Two people with the purest of intentions ensnared by the cruelest circumstances . 
- Are you trying to turn this into some kind of ... - Shh , shh , shh . Sweetie , sweetie . I can intuit what you 're thinking . 
Okay ? And I forgive you . 
- You nearly killed me , you carnival-act fraud . 
- Stop ! Break it up ! 
- She crossed a boundary ! 
- I am thrilled to announce the launch of our new product , 
B. Welles Detox , a high-quality , at-home chelation system that will help remove heavy toxic metals from our systems . 
- Pollutants she put there . 
Stay super sweet . 
Really beautiful dress . 
Anyhoozle ... I 'm very excited to say that I 'll be partnering with the fabulous Purdue Pharma . 
Can we do another one , Rowan ? 
- I am ending up with some ceremonial-grade lip balm . 
- As am I. 
Big bet . - Big time . - Wait a minute . Are you gambling with precious B. Welles products ? 
- And losing quite badly , I might add . 
- I would happily trade all the serums and balms in the world to never have to do a Wellness Week ever again . 
- Hear , hear . Cap ? Please ? No , we can 't . 
- I 'm one step ahead of you whiners . As usual . 
I spoke to Lenore this morning . 
We are not renewing with B. Welles . 
Didn 't hurt that Lenore had broken out in hives from one of the sunless tanners that Bethany had given her . 
Well , from now on , when it comes to wellness , I 'm sticking to the classics . 
Eat your veggies , take the stairs , drink water . 
- And regular checkups . 
- And maybe a colonic here or there . 
- Hi . Soup . 
It 's cooked . 
- Is this an olive branch ? 
- Uh , well , it 's my chicken cassoulet with basil oil and white truffle . 
All of that raw-meat stuff , that was Bethany . 
This is more me . 
That 's , um ... That 's incredible . - Well , there 's more where that came from . 
- Uh , reminds me ... Chef Ricamore has , uh , suddenly made an abrupt departure from the Odyssey . 
Something crazy like a newborn baby girl or something . 
So Vivian has graciously agreed to stay with us for the rest of the season . 
- Oh , wait . You , uh ... You quit your job with Bethany ? 
Congrats . 
- Yeah . She gave a whole new meaning to toxic work environment . - Mm-hmm . 
- I 'm looking forward to cooking for people who are actually sane . 
- Oh , well , let me know when you find those people . 
Okay . Well , that 's my cue . 
This week , I give you three permission to stay below deck while we manage the disembarkment . 
Come with me ? - Yeah . I 'll , um ... I 'll see you around . 
- Yeah , yeah . Okay . I will catch you on the port side . 
Really , Tristan ? 
- Real talk . I almost died last night , didn 't I ? - What ? 
! No . - Once you were out , there were hardly any waves . Honestly . We breezed right through it . 
It was simple . 
Yeah . Okay . Go on . 
Get out of here . 
You only get two days before the next cruise . 
Roller skating on the boardwalk or play Whac-A-Mole or whatever it is you do in your free time . What are you doing ? 
- You know , I was never any good at roller-skating . 
- I don 't play Whac-A-Mole because of ethical issues . Animal cruelty . 
Now , if you 're not gonna eat that soup , I have a delicious new recipe . 
It 's pizza rolls , but you don 't cook them . You eat them raw . 
- Yes , we plucked them from the pepperoni tree , just like our ancestors used to . - Ah . 
Idiots . - Both of you . 
If I bust these sutures , you 're fixing ' em . 
Okay . Deal me a hand . I think I 'm getting the hang of this . 
- Ceremonial-grade lip balm . What kind of ceremony needs lip balm ? 
- Oh , wouldn 't you love to know ? 
- Your sutures . 
- Ow ! - Stop it .
