Doctor , welcome aboard the odyssey . You must be my nurses . 
We are the ship 's nurses . 
This ship is a dream . 
So it 'll be your job to keep everyone alive . 
I 'm king of the world ! 
Man overboard . 
Come on ! 
- We got him . - Thank god . 
I have a secret . 
Is it that you 're in love with Avery ? 
Please don 't tell the captain . 
Yeah , I was just about to text him . 
Nine ... 
Come on , come on , come on , come on , come on . 
Ten ! 
205 , bro . - That 's insane . - Yeah . 
You want the same ? 
Give me 40 more . 
You know , I still haven 't decided what I 'm going to do about what you did with Avery . 
You broke the code . 
Bro code ? Seriously ? The code of conduct , Maxwell bank man , page 83 , section a , prohibiting intimate relationships between supervisors and subordinates . You know , it 's grounds for termination . 
You 've been a very bad boy . 
- I got it , I got it . 
I heard a hemorrhoid pop . You okay ? 
It won 't happen again . 
Scout 's honor . 
So don 't turn me in . 
However , what we really need to talk about is this an obsession that you have with Avery . 
That 's what I plan on dealing with this week . 
You know what they say the best way to get over one person is ... - Therapy . 
- To get underneath someone else . 
Singles week , Max . Strap in . 
No , no , no . Damn it ! 
I 'm so sorry . I can 't find my phone . 
Could I , use yours to call it ? Yeah . 
Of course . 
I swear I am not high . 
Would you look at that ? Look at that . Thank ... thank ... thank you so much . 
God . It 's like a pilgrimage to a mecca for the chronically insecure . 
I don 't know , going on a week-long cruise all by yourself , I think that takes brass balls . 
They 're not all so bad . 
Absolutely not . 
You are both cardboard cutouts with erections . 
I can live with that . 
You made it . 
I don 't know how I let you talk me into this . 
A singles cruise ? I 'm having heart palpitations ! It 's called being excited . 
Don 't worry , I will be right here the whole time , glamma . 
I will be your beach bitch . 
Language . I don 't want to hear that word this week . " Glamma " ? 
Luggage . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
Basal Insulin , bolus Insulin , and hydrocortisone cream . 
Check , check , and check . 
Hey , I need you to do me a favor . 
The singles week eventually warms up , but the first night is awkward . 
The captain 's dinner , everyone just stands around and hugs the wall like a bunch of 7th graders at a sock hop , so he makes us take the lead . 
What , like dance with the guests ? Not me , right ? I 'm a doctor . 
You 're a hot , young , single doctor . So especially you . But I have a plan . 
We 'll pair up , do our little shimmy shake . We 'll set the mood , we won 't have to engage . 
I can 't . 
Tristan ? 
It is so obvious . 
He would never forgive me . 
This crush isn 't real . It 's puppy love . 
Some unresolved mommy issues . He needs to get over it . 
Fine . I 'll just dance with some human petri dish , and get scabies and die . 
Speaking of which , we need more pubic lice shampoo . 
You really don 't like singles week , do you ? - Bad experience ? - No . It 's just relationships are not my thing . 
I spent eight years in school with no financial help , it took two jobs to get through , all so I could pursue this career where I dedicate myself to people . 
You know , humanity at large . Eight years , you could have been a doctor . 
Yes , I could have been , if I had done that schooling in the right order , which I did not . 
Situation . Top deck . Hot tubs . 
" Situation " ? What does that mean ? 
It means bring ice packs . 
You bitch ! 
Break it up ! Break it up ! 
Back it up , please . 
I felt that ! 
I tasted that . 
Nasty , dirty , little triflin ' girls . 
You want a rematch ? 
Whistle through that gap tooth , Jack-o ' - lantern-face ass . 
You pirate-looking bitch ! 
Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop ! 
Hold still . Geez . 
What ? Are you all fighting over some man ? 
Not some man , my man . 
He wanted to bring his girlfriend and his little side piece , too . I 'm cool . 
Bring ' em on the cruise , I say . 
And then I catch this bitch trying to take off the damn condom , like I wouldn 't see it . 
It 's not like you were gonna give him a baby . Womb like a haunted house , just dusty . Okay , okay , okay . 
When we fight over men , we instantly give them complete and total power over us . 
Look at yourselves . 
No man is worth this . 
Jeffery is . 
Jeffery is that ... " D. " 
You know what I 'm saying ? 
And when that " d " calls , you drop everything and run . - Amen . 
- Okay , well , I 've never had any " d " like that . 
And if you keep up this stupid fight , I 'm having all three of you dropped off in puerto del sol . Girl . 
You need to get you some . You know , for your health . 
Don 't you know ? You 're a doctor . I 'm a nurse , not a doctor . 
Okay , kids , you know the drill . 
Dance . And don 't make me ask you twice . 
So what 's the deal here ? 
We 're just supposed to pick somebody and make them dance with us ? 
If you 're you , yes . If you 're me , you just walk right up . 
Tristan , don 't do this to yourself again . 
Remember what happened last time ? We could end up in a dance-off . 
Maybe she 's coming to ask me to dance . Sorry . I 'm so nervous . Everything inside me is telling me I should just go back to my cabin and scroll my phone all night , so I 'm going to not do that . 
Do you want to dance ? 
- Yes . - Cool . After you . 
And away we go . 
Excuse me , miss . Would you care to dance ? 
I 'm legally obligated to ask someone to dance . 
Why don 't you go ? 
I 'd love to . 
Fantastic . 
So , your friend ... Who is definitely 100 % not my grandma . 
I begged her to come on this trip . I just ... 
I don 't want her to regret it . 
I have an idea . 
Do you see that handsome gentleman in the white jacket over my shoulder ? What do you think ? 
What do you say , captain ? Shall we show these kids a thing or two ? 
I would be honored . 
Can I tell you a secret ? Sure . 
This being single thing is very new to me . 
Well , you 're faking it beautifully . 
I 'm definitely the oldest single person here . 
And probably also the only widow . 
- I 'm sorry . 
- He was an a-hole . 
Lucky for me . Makes grieving a lot easier . 
Well , you 're in good company . 
You may be the only widow here , but your dance partner is the only widower . As far as I know . 
- How long ? 
- A year ago . 
But , unlucky for me , she was my everything . 
And now , I 'm just kind of ... Out here adrift . 
That 's our cue . 
Kelly ? Kelly ? 
Let 's start with what we can rule out . 
She says she 's not taking any medication . So it 's not an adverse reaction . 
It 's definitely not dehydration . 
She doesn 't go anywhere without that dumb , trendy water bottle . 
Sudden onset is concerning . 
What can come on suddenly with only one symptom ? 
Vasovagal syncope ? 
Fainting as a response to an emotional trigger ? 
You think she swooned over you ? 
It 's not unheard of . 
In fact , I really hope you 're right . - Why ? 
- Because if not , she may only have a 30 % chance of surviving the next 48 hours . 
Aortic dissection . 
What 's going on ? What are you doing ? We 're giving you a transesophageal echocardiogram to get a clearer picture of your heart and see what 's going on . 
- I need to turn you , okay ? 
- What ? - Wh-what do you think it is ? 
- Possibly aortic dissection , a small tear in the aorta . It would come on quickly , and syncope would be one of the first symptoms . 
- This is a light sedative . - Kelly . Hey . You 're gonna be okay . 
Open your mouth . This spray is a local anesthetic . It 's going to numb your throat and your esophagus . Wait , wait , wait . 
I have to be awake for this ? 
No , no , no , no , no . Can 't you just , like , put me completely under ? 
Unfortunately , we cannot . Can I ... I need to call my parents . 
It 's imperative that we do this procedure immediately . - No . 
I 'm okay , I 'm okay . 
- I know , I know , but I 'm right here , and I 'm not going anywhere . 
Yeah , I won 't lie ... this is gonna suck , but for a really short amount of time , and then it 's gonna be over , and we 're gonna figure it all out . 
- Okay . 
You can do this . You 're amazing . Let 's go . 
It 's okay , you can do this . You 're gonna do this , it 's okay . 
- You can do this , Kelly . - My ... what ? You can do this . Hey , it 's okay . 
We 're so close . 
Come on . 
She 's hypotensive . 
Heart rate dropping . 46 . 
She 's in v-fib . 
Get the probe out now . 
Kelly , come on . Stay with me now . 
- Charging . - Charging . Charge ! 
So you still don 't know what 's wrong with me , then ? 
No , but we do know that you don 't have a hole in your heart . 
We got one picture , and it was enough . 
Structurally , your heart and your aorta are healthy . 
So we 're back to square one . No . 
Not square one . We just eliminated the worst case scenario . 
We will figure this out . 
I promise . 
What 's up ? 
Hey , ladies ! 
- What 's up ? 
You are aware that this is not a swingers cruise , right ? 
- Or , like , a bathhouse ? 
- It 's singles week , homie . Anything goes . 
Hey , you 're the new doc , right ? - Yep . - While I got you here , I got this thing on my , stomach . 
Hard to say . It could be eczema . Sweet . It 's harmless , right ? - Eczema ? - Yeah . Why don 't you come downstairs , I 'll take a look at it . 
No can do . I got prior obligations . 
Okay . Well , at least let me get you some condoms . No . 
Never use them . Like , that 's horrible for the environment . 
You 'd be shocked how many turtles choke on those things . 
- Am I late ? 
- No , you 're right on time . 
Well , what do you think ? Overkill ? Too much for a sunset dinner ? 
It 's wonderful . 
Champagne ? 
I 'm not kidding . 
I think for a long time , I felt it was just too late for me to do anything exciting or different . 
Then my husband passed away , and it was a wake-up call . 
It 's only too late when you 're dead . 
Until then , carpe diem . 
- Seize the day . 
Well , the adventure life seems to suit you . 
I agree . What is it they say about oysters ? 
Hold on . You 're dribbling . 
You 're flushed . 
I think the oysters are doing their job , captain . 
Are you okay ? What 's happening ? Robert . 
Robert ! 
Everything points to a heart attack . 
We 'll know soon enough . 
Sheath . 
Catheter has reached the heart . 
Contrast going in . 
So weird . He has all the symptoms of a heart attack , but the EKG was normal and the angiogram showed no blockage . 
Heart attack , but without the heart attack part . 
Maybe the angiography missed something . 
When we get his blood tests back , note his troponin levels . 
If they 're elevated , it 's almost certainly a heart attack . But if not ... Sorry . 
I 'm Spencer munroe , first officer , captain 's second in command . 
- How 's he doing ? - Stable . 
Resting . Now we 're running some more tests . 
How long is he going to be out for ? 
A bit . 
What is it , Spencer ? 
It just showed up on our screen . 150 nautical miles , maybe 7 or 8 hours away . 
Whatever it is , it 's equipped with a radar reflector . 
That 's how we were able to pick it up at a distance . 
Might just be debris , a rogue buoy , but it could be a life raft . 
If we 're going to divert , we have to do it now . But I need the captain to make the call . 
Who makes the call when the captain 's out of commission ? Me . Just never had to do anything like this before . 
In my job , if you have the ability to help , you have the responsibility to help . Even if it 's a hail Mary . 
Let 's get that raft . 
You want to tell me why the hell I 'm not seeing huatulco , Mexico , out the port side ? 
Well , I 'll tell you how I know . 
It 's ' cause I 'm looking out the port side and all I see is ocean . 
I want a full briefing , an engine report , and a double Espresso waiting . 
Report . 
Captain , we picked up a distress beacon and a ping on sonar , and altered course . 
They 're now 10 nautical miles ahead . We 're doing 18 knots . 
Increase the speed to 25 knots . I want to cut the intercept time by seven minutes . 
Yes , sir . Rescue boats are ready to launch . We radioed any other vessels in the vicinity and shore . 
Launch them at five miles out . They can get there quicker , and then we slow . - Yes , sir . 
- Doctor . I want you out there with me on the first rescue boat . 
Captain . I can 't have you out there with us . 
I need you to stay with the ship . 
Doctor 's orders . 
Understood . 
Tristan and I will go with the rescue team . 
Avery , prep for dialysis in case there 's kidney damage . - Also ready a hypotonic drip . 
There . Right there . 
Let 's go . Okay . Hi . My name is Tristan . 
You 're safe . 
You 're going to be okay . All right ? 
I just need to check your pulse . 
Hang on . 
We have to get her back to the ship now . Diagnosis ? 
Patient is suffering gastroenteritis , probably from saltwater exposure , severe heatstroke , and dehydration . 
- Get an I.V. In her now . - On it . - Avery , get her hooked up . - D5w . 
Slow infusion . 
We need to crack this carefully . Okay . 
Thank you . 
You 're welcome . 
I.v. Is ready for administration with slow drip rate , as instructed . 
I think we 're good . 
She 's crashing . 
V-fib . 
- 200 joules . I 'm not sure if that 's enough , but ... 
- No pulse . - Going to 300 . 
Clear . 
I have a pulse . 
I 'll adjust the drip rate and keep an eye on her electrolytes . 
Why did she crash like that ? - The hypernatremia ? 
- It 's a combination of factors . 
The hypernatremia is a risk given her condition . 
It can strain the heart . 
But she 's also severely dehydrated , which means that her blood volume is critically low . 
It 's a balancing act ... trying to hydrate her while not overwhelming her system . 
Becoming some kind of team ? 
We left Venezuela when there was nothing there for us anymore . 
No money . Just me taking care of as much as I could for our family . 
I end up in port chiapas . 
I get work in the only work I could , on a ... 
What happened ? 
The fire , it started in the engine . 
I make it out on the raft . 
Manuel ... he work on the boat , too . 
We were going to be married . 
Out there , all those days , I think nobody is looking for me . 
If Manuel is gone , no one is waiting for me to come home . 
I am alone . 
And then a miracle . 
You 're going to be okay . 
Lurking ? 
Keeping an eye on my patient . 
I 've been thinking about your theory about Kelly . 
Vasovagal syncope , fainting as a response to an emotional trigger . 
Like those girls who 'd pass out when they saw Elvis , - that sort of thing . 
- As loathe as I am to liken you to the king of rock ' n ' roll , yes , I think you 're right . 
It 's the only thing that fits . I 'm going to set her up with an electrophysiologist when we get back to port . 
You want to call a truce ? 
No more fighting over girls . 
It 's regressive . Reductive ? Both . 
I would love to call a truce . Because if we keep on playing this out , there 's only one end . We become that guy . 
I just threw up in my mouth . 
Nobody wants to be that guy . 
- That guy sucks . - Yeah . And that guy doesn 't get the girl . 
That 's ... Awful . 
No , no , no . 
You know , a lot of people think I juice , but it 's all natural , babe . 
You know what , I need to go . 
What , and not get a piece of this ? 
What is that ? 
Eczema probably . 
I 'm serious , though . I don 't take anything . 
Body is a shrine . 
No ibuprofen , nothing . 
I mean , Adderall , sure . And diuretics . But that 's the only way I 'm going to shredsville . 
Wait . 
I need to go . Sorry . 
And you need penicillin . That is not eczema . 
Avery . Okay , you cannot ... 
- Please ... - I know what 's wrong with Kelly . We need to find her . 
Kelly , we know you didn 't tell us the whole truth . 
When Tristan did your intake , he asked if you had taken any medications . 
I 'm not taking anything . 
What 's in that ? 
I saw you shaking it . 
It 's just ... it 's a health powder . 
With thiazide in it ? 
It 's a diuretic . 
I didn 't think that it mattered . 
Thiazide . Makes you drop pounds like crazy . I know . It also interrupts electrical signals to your heart , which can cause you to pass out . It can even cause your heart to stop . It 's really dangerous stuff . 
It was only supposed to be for the week . 
I spent so much money on this trip , I have to look I have to look pretty in a swimsuit . 
I sound so vapid . I know . 
It 's okay . 
But I 'm gonna need you to come with us . - Yeah . - I 'm gonna put you on a drip of potassium and electrolytes until your levels even out . 
You 're gonna be all right , Kelly . 
Hey , aves ? 
Aves , you 're a genius . Back there , 
I mean , that was crazy , that diagnosis . Seriously . 
Too bad it doesn 't matter . Of course it matters . 
When she was ... Talking ... analisa about being on the raft , I saw it all so clearly . 
Myself , my life . 
I 've given up everything good . 
Everything that matters . Relationships , family . All for this job . 
And at the end of the day ... I 'm alone . Adrift . With nothing to show for it . 
I 'm never going to be a doctor . - Hey . 
Pumping people 's stomachs when they eat too much shrimp , and flings with loser douche bags on singles cruises . 
That 's it . 
Forever . 
You 're wrong , aves . 
Even if this is all there is ... It still matters . 
Because you matter . 
You matter to me . 
Really , big man ? 
So one line , we 're good . And two lines , syphilis . 
But it could be other things , right ? 
Yeah , sure , it could be measles , rubella , scabies , lyme disease ... - And it 's not . - Damn it ! 
Winner , winner , chicken dinner . Okay , I 'm going to give you an antibiotic . 
I will also need a list of everybody that you 've been with since you got on the ship . 
We contact the partners for you anonymously . 
Got to protect that reputation . 
I 'm going to need more paper . 
Go ahead . Say it . 
That 's not really a diagnosis I 'm qualified to make . 
But , look , we all have our things , those holes inside of us that we 're trying to fill . 
Some people use booze , I use triathlons and work , you use sex . 
But eventually you 're going to find that you are the hole , and then you 're going to have to crawl all the way up out of yourself just to be sane , and to grow up a little bit . 
So focus on the doughnut , not the hole , as my father used to say . 
Is the hole , like , a hole in a sexual sense ? 
No , no hot tubs for a little while . 
Sure , whenever you 're done with your massage . 
You 're not going to believe this . 
Okay , we 'll see you soon . 
We 're here all day . 
I need that finger . Right . 
I think about that woman every day . 
- Yeah ? 
- We were invincible . We thought . 
Didn 't factor in the cancer , heart attacks . 
Okay . What do you got ? 
Lay it on me . Both barrels . 
Well , when you first collapsed , you had all the symptoms of a heart attack , except one ... no coronary blockage , which means no heart attack . That 's the good news . 
But it still begs the question , " what did happen ? " 
And I think I found the answer . 
Stress cardiomyopathy . Better known as broken heart syndrome . 
Come on . 
What what kind of medical journal did you get that out of ? A Danielle Steele novel ? 
I know it sounds made up , but unfortunately the condition is quite real and quite serious . 
It mimics heart attack and is triggered by emotional stress . 
Sometimes ... actually , often brought on by the loss of a loved one . 
She was the love of my life . 
I miss her so much , it hurts . 
I can tell . 
So tell me , doc , how do we treat this broken heart ? 
Existential answer ? I have no idea . Medical answer , I 'm going to put you on ace inhibitors to bring down your blood pressure , and I 'm going to order you to take it very , very easy . 
Okay . 
So you 're saying that , in order to keep living , I got to stop living my life . 
You know what the worst thing for our health is ? Being alive . 
Life comes with risks . There 's no way around it . 
But we just got to keep on moving forward . 
Thank you , doctor . 
That 's exactly what I 'm going to do . 
Maybe three-quarter steam ahead for a little while . 
Hi . Just , checking in . 
You doing okay ? 
And you ? Are you okay ? 
Yeah . 
Do you want to come sit ? 
Sure . 
You don 't know what 's gonna happen . 
You don 't know when you 're gonna die , nobody does . 
- Sorry . 
- It 's okay . 
You must have been so scared . 
I can only imagine what it was like to be out there all alone . 
Doubting every choice you made . 
You must miss him so much , Manuel . 
- I 'm sorry . - Yes , I do . 
But at least I had him . True love , I found that . 
Which is more than most people can say . Especially on this ship ... During singles week . 
I remember how young I was when this song came out . 
Yeah , I was in the Navy . 
I was looking to make admiral . 
I remember being far out at sea , and I 'd hear these love songs come across the radio . And I would feel like my life before me was just a big adventure . 
- And now ? - Less adventures , and a couple of more naps . 
I love naps . 
Why don 't we get out of this cheap gin joint and go get a room ? 
My room . 
I thought you 'd never ask , admiral . 
You know , I can 't promise you much more than a little fun and a good roll in the hay . 
Because you 're married to the sea ? 
- Yeah , something like that . 
- Captain . Ma 'am . 
A man in a life ring was just found floating off of puerto escondido . It 's our rescue 's fiancé . He 's alive . 
Well , I 'll be damned . 
Someone 's adventure is going to have a happy ending . 
Let 's make it two . 
- What 'll it be , boys ? - A ranch water . - You know it ? 
- Tequila , lime juice , and topo chico , sure . 
And for you , doctor ? 
I will have a very dry Martini , vigorously shaken , with three olives . 
- Right away . - " Vigorously shaken . " You 're so weird sometimes . You know that ? 
- I was going for bond . 
I 'll work on it . 
You talk to Avery ? She 's had such a hard week . 
I feel bad for her . I don 't know what to do . 
Us not fighting over her might be one thing . 
Yeah , that might help . 
No one likes a cad . 
Ooh , " cad . " Now , that is bond . 
I do have one other idea . 
Booty pads , compression socks , female urinal wipes , absorbent pads , blue disposable under pads , and long maxi pads . Minimal coverage face masks , no neck . Minimal coverage face masks , full neck . 
Is there something I should know ? 
You really don 't read the schedules , do you ? 
It 's plastic surgery week . 
What , people come for a post-op cruise ? 
A little rr while they recover from their facelifts and their tummy tucks and their butt lifts ? 
- That 's the idea . 
Well , I think that 's fabulous . 
By the way , good news for syphilis Sam we 've seen a positive response to the penicillin . 
Rpr titers have decreased significantly . So he 's going to be fine . Fine to go on doing what he does . 
- Spreading joy . - But hopefully not the clap . 
So , Avery , I 've been reading up about this little cruise line of ours . And they have all of these higher education - full-ride scholarships . 
- And ? And I spoke to the captain , and if you wanted , if you decided that you would like to be an md , he will support you for a full scholarship . 
And if you are selected , the company just asks that you give them three years after your residency as the ship 's doctor . 
How did I not know this ? 
Always look for the secret door . Every place has one . 
Hey , you know what 's more good news ? 
- Analisa 's fiancé ... 
They found him . - Yeah . - No , no way . Really ? - Yeah . 
He 's going to be there when we dock . 
Maybe you should go tell her . 
- You crying , dude ? - Yes . Behind these movie star glasses , I am crying . 
- I love singles week . 
- I thought you hated it . 
What 's to hate about a couple of fairytale endings ? 
Hers and mine . 
Now I 'm blubbering . 
See you next year . 
I was thinking maybe next time I would try a monastery . No . 
Leave those nuns alone . 
Blood test again in six weeks . Don 't forget . 
Wow . Wait up , ladies ! 
Thank you . Thank you all for being so brilliant and saving my life . 
So don 't put me in your file under " dumb , next . " - I 'm usually pretty smart . 
- I know . I loved our time together . 
Yeah . Still got it . 
And they 're ... gone . Okay , can we please go somewhere on land with beers and oysters and no emergencies ? 
I know just the spot .
