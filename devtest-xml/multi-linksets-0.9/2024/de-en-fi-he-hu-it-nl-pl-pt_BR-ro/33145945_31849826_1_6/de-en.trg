A hospital in New Haven reporting Connecticut 's first ever case of the novel coronavirus . 
So , against all odds , I lived . 
And because I lived , I decided that I was gonna pursue joy . At all costs . 
- Guys , I have an unresponsive patient ! - 
- What 's going on ? 
Bad call , man . You 're her superior . You understand ? That 's like a fireable offense . 
If you wanted talk about what happened ... I don 't have to talk about what happened . Do you wanna talk - - Oh . No , no , no . If you 're good , I 'm good . - We 're great . - Okay . We 're good . - Yeah , it 's good . - Yeah , good . 
As I made crystal clear in my email , Corey , I wanted fresh peonies placed in every room two hours before arrival . 
And seeing as this boat is a buyout for my wedding , I was shocked when we arrived and I saw windows open . 
Tell me , Corey , tell me , Corey , how is the smell of fresh peonies supposed to suffuse the air if the windows are open ? 
I 'm so sorry . Our guests usually like the fresh air . 
I 'll see what I can do . 
Thank you . 
Oh , wow . Hello . Oh , wow . Come lay out with your mama . Take a load off . 
- Baby oil ? - Uh-huh . What , so I can look like an old leather tanning boot before I 'm 30 ? 
Pass . 
You really should try a self-tanner , I 've been telling you . 
I don 't spray , I lay . 
Thirty years of cruising , Mama knows how to get a tan . 
I 'm getting married ! 
All right . Give it up for the best man . 
Hey , everyone . 
So , this dude , Eric , has been my best friend since seventh grade . And he is very nervous that I 'm gonna say something embarrassing , like how many girls he slept with at Sig Alph but I 'm not gonna do that , - ' cause it was way too many to count . 
- Way too many . But , seriously ... 
- Make him shut up . 
- He 's just messing around . 
- Eric , it 's embarrassing . 
It 's not true . Come on . - It 's not funny either . - Hey . Come on . It 's fine . 
Where 's Mom ? 
This is the welcome dinner . She 's just missing it ? 
And he bought me a house . 
I don 't have great credit ... ... in case anyone wonders ... - Are you crying , Cap ? - No . 
Maybe . 
So what if I am ? 
I 'm a sucker for love . 
These antiquated mating rituals are not about love anymore . They 're about money , Instagram likes , and making your single friends jealous . 
Look at them all , they 're miserable . Especially the bride and groom . 
I don 't know . I always thought my wedding day ... 
Well , never mind . 
- Say it . - No . You made yourself abundantly clear . - You 're just gonna make fun of me . 
Fine . I always thought my wedding day would be the proudest day of my life . 
Didn 't the president give you an award for saving infants with club feet ? - Cleft palates . - Oh . And it was the UN Secretary-General . 
I 'd like to get married one day . Have a big family . Six little Tristans running around . 
Can you picture it ? 
- That 's an admirable goal . 
The world needs more love . Lots of love . All different kinds of love . 
I 'm for it . 
What 's so wrong about celebrating it ? 
I love you , Eric . 
I really do . 
And I 'm not going anywhere . Cheers , everyone . Yeah . Cheers ! 
Where is Mom ? 
This is insane . 
I don 't know . Just try to enjoy yourself , all right ? 
It 's an extreme sunburn . Second-degree burns , blistering on both of her limbs . 
Sleepy Sun Syndrome . We 've seen it a thousand times . 
But never like this . 
- Sweet mother of - - 
- The bride . Mother of the bride ! 
The ceremony is in-in three days . 
You have to help me . 
Deep breaths , Ellen . 
Let 's give her four of morphine , tetanus shot , and hang lactated Ringer 's . 
It just doesn 't make sense . I never burn . 
I live in South Florida . I know how to lay out . 
Are you on any new medications ? Or maybe a new skin care routine ? 
I-I-I don 't know . I started some antibiotic crap a couple weeks ago . 
- Doxycycline ? 
- Doxy ... What ? I 'm not a scientist . 
It 's for my rosacea . I didn 't want to look red in the pictures . Well ... Tetracycline antibiotics can cause severe photosensitivity . 
It 's like developing an allergy to the sun . 
Jesus wept . Just stick me with an EpiPen , I have to look good for this wedding . 
We 're gonna give you something for the pain , something to reduce inflammation . 
- And these blisters ... - Watch it ! ... are going to rupture and peel . 
- This is gonna ruin everything . - Mrs . 
Parsons , I don 't want you to worry . 
We here at The Odyssey are experts in sunburn care . 
And I 'd bet that somewhere under that redness there is a beautiful , golden , Riviera tan just waiting to be set free . 
Oh , Lord , I hope so . ' Cause that girl 's gonna cook my goose if I show up looking like this . 
Please don 't come in . - Don 't listen to her . - Just come in . Thank you . Come on in . - Hi . - Oh , my God . Please don 't look . - You 're okay . Talk to me . What 's going on ? - His thing is stuck and won 't come out . 
- She won 't let me out . 
- It closed like a bear trap . - It 's like ... in it . - It 's been like this for a while . 
- Deep breaths , both of you . 
What you 're experiencing is a condition called Penis Captivus . 
- What ? Penis what ? 
- Captivus . 
It 's a stress response . 
The vaginal muscle spasms and firmly closes . 
If the penis remains engorged , it can exacerbate the situation . 
Just give us one sec . 
So ... 
We need to get her to relax , but the more she tries , the worse this is gonna get . 
We gotta get her to focus on something else . 
Having an audience isn 't helping . I have an idea . 
There should be an endoscopic balloon dilator in the triage bag . 
- That 's a great idea . - Manual separation , very good . 
Maybe you can cue up one of those famous , long-winded Max Bankman stories just for good measure . 
- Deyja ? - Yes . This device is called a balloon catheter . 
I want you to gently insert this end as best as you can , okay ? Oh , my God . And I am going to slowly inflate the balloon and try to coax the vaginal walls to open . 
Oh , my God . This is so embarrassing . 
Probably the stupidest thing you 've seen in your whole life . 
Nothing to be embarrassed about . 
Let me tell you about something embarrassing . 
So , when I was a kid I loved to play ding-dong ditch . 
You know that game ? Where you press the doorbell and run away . 
- Yeah , sure . - Uh-huh . This one time , I 'm nine years old . Pushed the doorbell , I 'm running away . Just about to turn the corner and I see these two cops . Their shadows there on the pavement . Big dudes , flat tops . The whole nine yards . And I 'm terrified . 
My heart is in my throat . And I just know , " Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . My life is over . These guys are gonna bust me . " I 'm looking around , " Where am I gonna go ? " And I see the alley . 
And I think , " This is it . This is my chance to escape . " 
So I screw up all of my courage , I take one step and boom ! All the lights come on . Klieg lights everywhere . 
And I turn around knowing I 'm busted and ... - What ? - What happened ? 
No cops . 
Just two brooms laying up against the fence . 
- Two brooms ? 
- There was nobody even in the house . There wasn 't anybody home . - Oh , my God . - Hey . - It 's out . 
- There it is . Oh , my Gosh . 
Thank you . Hey , but ... Can I get , like , your Instagram handle just so we can ... 
- Really ? - Yeah . - Yeah . 
Thanks , Doc . 
Hey , Bennet , uh , can I see you down in the infirmary ? - Just for a quick follow-up . - Yeah . Sure , man . 
Thanks . 
Okay , what is going on ? 
You look properly bugged out . And that looks like garden-variety eczema . 
It 's not . 
Bennet , are you familiar with Trichophyton mentagrophytes type seven ? 
- No . 
- More commonly known as ringworm . It 's usually a garden-variety fungal infection , nothing to be worried about , but there is a rare strain , spread through skin-to-skin contact that I saw while I was in Africa . 
Left untreated , it can have some pretty serious symptoms , including blindness . 
The good news is , because we caught it early , cultured it to be exactly sure , yours will not be left untreated . 
- There is a drug . 
- Bad news is , we don 't have it on hand . But we can get it at the next port . 
In the meantime I 'm gonna give you clotrimazole cream that will bring down the itchiness and redness . - Okay . 
- And , mate , no more pulling tail . 
That 's what weddings are for . Thank you . No . No . No . This strain is highly , highly contagious . 
Anyone you 've had sexual contact with is gonna need to be alerted , including Deyja . 
We can do it on your behalf , if you prefer . 
I 'm fine . I , uh , I 'm not a complete jackass . 
I 'll handle it . Thank you . 
Look at all these happy wedding guests . 
Marriage causes nothing but agony . I stand by it . 
Come on , you have never wanted to fall in love ? 
I thought about it once . 
And ? What changed your mind ? 
I went through with it . You ... Wait , hold on . You ? - You were married ? 
- Yes . For the briefest of moments . 
This does not leave this circle . 
Of course . Your secret 's safe with me . So long as you tell me all the scintillating details . 
Scintillating , it was not . It was a depressingly short story . 
Even better . I 'm a very busy doctor , as you can see . 
I had known Kevin since kindergarten . And he was funny and charming , easy . 
And after graduation , we fell into a routine , hanging with the same crew from high school , weekends drinking beers in Tessa Matsumoto 's garage . 
And I thought , " Okay , we 'll just keep doing this forever . Cool . Get married ? Why the heck not ? " But ? 
But on our honeymoon his phone kept blowing up . He was in the shower . And with one little peek , everything I thought I knew about this person went up in smoke . 
No ... - Wait . Not - - - Tessa Matsumoto . Yeah . - The one and only . - Oh , man , that sucks . 
- I 'm so sorry . 
- Don 't be . I 'm very over it . 
It led me to reevaluate my life . And it inspired me to make a bucket list . 
And the first thing on it was to see the world . That 's why I took this job . 
What else is on that bucket list ? 
- I 'll never tell . 
- Oh , come on . 
Well , I for one , am glad you 're here . 
And to hell with Kevin and Tessa Matsumoto . 
- They just had triplets . 
Karma is the best . 
Does it ever abate , even for a second ? 
Nope . Let 's go . 
Get out . You 're not supposed to see me like this ! 
- Relax , all right ? 
- Get out . 
Just promise you 'll take care of her , yeah ? 
Oh , good , you 're here . 
She 's - - She 's having some kind of episode . 
Jitters , maybe . 
- This is to monitor your vitals . 
- It 's not jitters , Mama . 
Oh , come on , baby girl , get it all out . 
- All right . Let me take a look . - Oh . 
Fever . 
Diaphoretic . 
Jaundice of the eyes . 
You mind leaning back for me ? 
Looks like pancreatitis . 
Are you on any medications ? 
Oh , dear God . 
You don 't understand , my dress , it 's , um ... It 's a vintage Vera Wang , it 's a size two . 
She 's been taking that Oz-lympic or whatever it 's called . 
You know , the-the skinny girl drug . 
I told her , back in my day the way we fit into our dresses was the old-fashioned way : 
laxatives , prunes and prayers . 
This dress , it 's just , um ... it 's a one of a kind and it can 't be altered . And it still won 't zip . 
So last week I doubled the dose , - just to get the last few pounds - - - Doubled ? 
I need you to come with me right now . 
Are you okay to walk - or would you prefer a wheelchair ? 
- Where are you taking her ? 
You daughter needs IV fluids , antibiotics and possibly a CT scan . 
Whoa . Fluids ? Yeah . No , no . I 'll bloat . 
Oh . But the rehearsal is tomorrow morning . 
Ma 'am , your daughter is at serious risk of liver failure . 
Unless you want this wedding to turn into a funeral , I need to admit her until I see a marked improvement in her health . 
How tall are you ? 
You ready ? 
- Cue music ! - Sorry . 
Okay . And we 're moving . We 're moving . Come on . 
And we 're walking . Let 's go . Let 's go . 
Okay . Good . Good . Good . 
Oh . You two look great . Do you know what to do over here ? 
Where 's my chair ? 
- Housekeeping . 
- Sorry , Mrs. Parsons . 
- So if you go there . 
Excuse me . - Thanks . Keep space between you . 
Now , keep going . 
This is it . 
- Fantastic , guys . 
- That 's the way I want it . 
Wow . She makes such a beautiful bride . Don 't you think ? 
- Oh , my God . That 's not the bride ! - Sorry . 
- Your daughter is more beautiful . 
- This is a rehearsal . The bride and groom need to know their marks . Because she 's recuperating and I couldn 't ... I couldn 't let the groom walk down here with some stranger , ' cause it 's bad luck . 
We will play the video back , so they 'll see where they 're supposed to go . 
- Honey . - Hi . 
Okay . Vows . Yada yada yada . 
As long as you both shall live ... Uh . In sickness and in health - - Oh , absolutely not . One sniffle and I 'm running away with Felipe . 
The pool boy ? 
How dare you ? 
And by the powers vested in me by Poseidon and Davy Jones , you may kiss the bride . 
I object ! 
Oh , please . 
Sorry , I 've always wanted to do that , for the drama . 
Yeah , well , this is - - this is over for the rehearsal . 
The wedding hasn 't even started . 
Don 't you know this is just a fake wedding ? 
You people are so stupid . 
Excuse me . Excuse me . 
You think , uh ... Care to have a word ? 
Of course . 
It started to show up a few days ago . 
You seen it before , Doc ? Yeah . Actually , I have seen that before . 
I don 't know what I 'm gonna do , man . 
Lisa hasn 't wanted to mess around because of the , you know , all the wedding stuff . But with the honeymoon coming up ... Man , she 's gonna find out everything . 
- Hey . Hey . - I just don 't know what to do . 
Slow down . What 's everything ? 
Let me get to know you a little bit , okay ? 
You said on your intake form that you 've had one partner in the last 30 days . 
- You 've been tested for STI 's . - No , stop . 
I come in here and you-you ask me to fill out a chart on your iPad , how many drinks I have , and-and how many sexual partners , and you think that you would know me from that . 
I mean ... ... it 's all a lie , man . 
All of this is a lie . 
My whole life is a lie . 
Eric , I got into this line of work so I could help people with problems , not to judge them for it . 
But I can only help you if you 'll tell me the truth . 
I 'm not a good person . 
I 'm really not . 
How many partners have you had in the last 30 days ? 
A lot . 
There 's something inside me , man . 
This-this-this darkness . 
- Eric - - - Eric ? I mean , Eric . He 's just ... - He 's gone , man . - He 's totally gone . 
What you 're describing is addiction . 
- No . - Sex addiction . 
- Which is a disease . And it 's very real . - No . No , man . No . And the good news is , because it 's a disease , it 's treatable . 
There are solutions . 
What you 're doing right now , talking about it , is by far the hardest part . 
I saw you guys out there . You and her . 
I mean , what you guys have is real . 
Anybody can see that . 
But me and Lisa , it 's just all a-a-a facade , man . 
- It 's all a game . 
- Just this whole thing , everything is not real . 
It 's all a-a game . It 's all fake . I ... I gotta go . - No . 
Come here . - Doc , please . I gotta go . I feel trapped . 
You 're having a panic attack . I 'd like to give you something for the anxiety . 
- I don 't wanna die here , man . 
- You 're not gonna die . I wanna give you something for the anxiety , but I need your consent . Is that okay with you ? 
Yes ? 
Okay . I 'd like to give you some lorazepam . 
Just take a seat . 
First thing I want you to do is just breathe . 
Just see if you can breathe . 
- Come right here . - Just listen to my voice . 
- Try to breathe . Try to breathe . - Okay . 
- Now , lean back . - Okay . 
- Eric . 
- Yeah ? 
I have seen bad things . Real bad things . 
And this is not one of them . 
Okay . Nobody bleeds , nobody dies . 
You 're gonna be okay . 
- Okay . - Nobody dies . It 's all good . 
Nobody dies . Nobody dies . 
Let 's start with what we know . First , the best man presents with symptoms of ringworm . 
Which is spread by close , sustained skin-to-skin contact . 
Which he probably gave to every bridesmaid and sexual partner he 's had in the past two to three weeks . 
Then the groom presents with the same symptoms . 
Sleeping with his best man . 
Or with someone who slept with the best man . 
Or they both independently contracted the same very rare strain of ringworm . 
Right . In this case , if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it 's probably - - A duck having a gay affair with his best man . 
We need to disclose to the bride , immediately . 
We can 't do that . 
HIPAA protects his right to privacy . 
We have to give him the option to disclose . 
He 's not in any condition to . 
Not tonight , but he will be . 
So for now , we say nothing . We don 't tell anything to anyone . 
Tomorrow morning I 'll have a talk with him and remind him of his responsibilities . 
If he refuses ? 
- Then I 'll tell him myself . - Tristan . Before the wedding . 
- Okay . Thank you . - Okay . That 's fair . It appears that fate has made this particular decision for us . 
I can 't believe this is happening . 
The wedding is in 18 hours and this thing just appeared . 
We think it 's probably just stress , you know , nerves and things , right ? 
- It 's not that bad , right ? 
- I think that might be a fungal rash . 
- No ! Mom ! - Hush . 
I need to do more investigation . In the meantime we can put a cream on - to bring down the inflammation . - Yes . Good . Yeah . No , that 's good . 
Slather it on me . I need this thing gone . Gone . 
I also have it on my back and my inner thigh . 
Good Lord . 
Thank you . 
You know if you 're having reservations , it 's not too late . 
What are you talking about ? 
- Well , reactions this intense the night before a wedding , it might be a sign that perhaps this isn 't what you want . 
I was married once , and walking down the aisle , I had this gut feeling , and I ignored it . 
And it turns out that my body knew something that my mind didn 't , - and I wish that I had listened . 
It hurts , doesn 't it ? 
The lotion ? 
Yeah , it can sting a little . 
No . No , I mean it must really hurt watching another woman succeed where you failed . 
Anyway , um , I can handle this . I got this from here . 
I know you guys have a lot going on , and I don 't wanna keep you , so have a good night . 
You know what ? You 're right . 
You and Eric are a perfect match . 
Good luck tomorrow . 
That is so sweet , Lisa . 
Thank y 'all for taking such good care of my baby girl . 
Oh . And look ... My Riviera tan , Doc . 
Code Alpha . Code Alpha . All crews to alpha stations . 
Guests , please return to your cabins . 
He left this , sir . 
All right , can somebody tell me how a $ 150,000 man-overboard detection system does not detect a man going overboard ? 
Unfortunately , sir , it 's not a foolproof system . 
It relies on camera feed to detect motion . Our working theory is that his black tuxedo at night didn 't register as movement . 
Well , that 's a damn failed system , isn 't it ? Yes , sir . 
- How long ago did he jump ? 
- Eight hours , 26 minutes , sir . Rosie . 
At full throttle , how quickly can you get us back in that vicinity ? 
I can shave off a few hours , but , sir , we were cruising at 24 knots last night . 
He jumped from a height of 97 feet . At that velocity , the water might as well be concrete . 
It is our policy on The Odyssey to give our guests the absolute best . 
And in difficult situations , the best I can offer you is honesty . 
Last night , Eric Colby went overboard - from the upper leisure deck . - What ? We were unaware of this incident until this morning . 
Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Uh . So , you ... Send someone out there , man . 
You go ... go get him . Right ? Do you have someone out there going to look for him or - - 
We 've dispatched several rescue boats , and we 've sent a distress signal to every floating vessel for a thousand nautical miles . 
Everything that can be done is being done . 
I assure you . Okay , but he can swim , so he 's alive . 
So he 's ... he 's down there - - He 's alive , right ? 
We are always prepared for any eventualities . 
Now , at the request of Eric 's family and loved ones , we are returning to our home port ... while we allow those vehicles that are best equipped to continue the search and recovery of Eric Colby . 
Now , I know we 're ... we 're all far from our home cities and civilizations . But here on The Odyssey , you are never alone . 
We are one ship . 
The medical team is standing by to offer you counseling . I encourage you , lean on them . Lean on me . 
I think I was , like , eight or nine , and it was the night before Easter . 
I snuck down to my playroom because I heard voices . 
I thought it was the Easter bunny . 
It wasn 't . It was Dad and ... his publicist . On the daybed . 
The next morning , Mama was hosting this big thing with everyone from church and the club . And she had these white calla lilies everywhere and it was perfect . 
I told her what I saw , and ... her smile did not falter for a second . 
She knew . 
She just said , " Baby girl , sometimes you gotta make things better to make things better . " 
So you were aware that Eric was being unfaithful ? 
I just didn 't know how to fix my relationship . 
But I thought that if I could make things perfect , for a day , just a day ... then maybe things would just fall into place . 
Maybe it would ... maybe it would be perfect . 
And Bennet ? 
You know about that ? 
He and Eric were ... intimate ? 
- Eric was bi ? 
- What ? No . 
Eric wasn 't sleeping with Bennet . I was . 
We all went to Duke together , and ... I-I liked Bennet . 
He was ... He was funny . Charming . 
But Eric ... Eric was ... Eric was marriage material . 
But I knew , you know ? I knew that he ... He really struggled . 
He really suffered with mental health . 
But I just pushed right on through because because I wanted to get married . 
I wanted the dream . 
- This is all my fault , isn 't it ? 
We all go through relationship troubles , one way or the other . But in the case of suicide , there are just so many other variables . 
Preexisting emotional trauma . - There are genetic factors at play . - No . Genetic ? 
That 's the answer ? Genetic ? 
No . 
No . I don 't understand . 
I need to understand . 
Hi , Mom . 
Baby girl . 
I 've been in the bridge all morning , waiting for news . 
Call came in from the Mexican coast guard . 
Body washed up somewhere south of Acapulco . 
- No . - They think it 's him . 
I want you to go up to my room and get under the covers . 
Okay . I just have two quick words for these doctors . 
I 'm sorry . 
I know I 've been an evil sea witch all week , and ... y 'all didn 't deserve that . 
I just love that girl so much . 
He was a troubled boy . I knew that . I ... I was concerned about that , but Lisa wanted this wedding here on this ship , so I ... I just pretended my fears away . 
That was wrong . 
I should 've done something . 
- I should 've stepped in and said , " Something is wrong here , and we need to discuss it , deal with it . " We needed to help this boy ! 
But I didn 't , and ... and now it 's too late and I 'll never forgive myself . 
Thank you . 
- Good evening . - It 's 1 : 30 in the morning . 
- What do you want ? 
- I can 't sleep . 
Fancy a little kitchen raid ? 
- Don 't mind if I do . 
- Really ? - What ? 
- She said she was gonna throw it out . - I heard her . 
I 'm sorry . - Really disrespectful . 
- Tristan ! 
- It 's really good . 
What if this was your wedding ? 
- Well , that would be awful . - Uh-huh . I mean , even worse if they were to do this ... What is going on here ? 
She started it . 
The only excuse for conduct this unprofessional would be if you paired it with a nice bottle of champagne . 
I 'm glad I found you both here ' cause you 're actually not off the clock yet . I have one more piece of business . 
If there is any silver lining to be found from this week 's tragedies it 's that it gives us a chance to take stock of life and what 's important to us . 
So , inspired by our very own Avery Morgan ... - Hmm ? - ... I have an assignment : bucket lists . 
I want each of you to give me five life goals , and then I wanna make a pact right here , tonight , that we 're all gonna help each other achieve them . 
- I 'm game . 
- Okay , me too . 
Excellent . 
Ah , ah , ah . Wait , Dr. Odyssey . 
I have the perfect place for this . 
Okay , bucket item list number one ... Bucket list item number one . 
I 'm drunk . Wow . Learn how to kitesurf . 
Number two : Break a world record . 
- For kitesurfing ? 
- No , for anything . 
You could do " most spoons hung on your face . " 
- What ? - That 's a real one . 
Three : I want a dog . You know , and a house on the beach with enough room for him to run in and where I can surf every day . 
Four ... I wanna fall in love . - You know ? - Hmm . Like , a forever in love . Yeah . Get married . 
- With six little Tristans running around ? 
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . Well , five . Okay , before the dog , before the marriage , before the kids ... - ... have a three-way . 
- Hmm . You 've never had a three-way ? 
You literally have a girl at every port . 
What ... They 're really difficult to organize . 
People ... people get drunk . They pass out . They get cold feet . I don 't know . - Tristan . - Hmm ? 
- Thank you . 
That was very well-shared . - Thanks , Doc . 
- Miss Morgan . - Hmm ? Your turn . Okay . But I 'm cold . Can we walk ? 
Yes , of course . 
- Snacks . - Snacks . 
- Well , you already know my first one . To see the world . Which I have . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . Second ... ... I wanna be a doctor . 
Well , you 're already on your way to that one . 
Thank you , both . 
Seriously . 
- Snacks . - And third : 
- To know yourself ? 
All right , I 'll accept that . 
- Next ... - Uh-huh . And ... Okay . No making fun of me . 
I want to perform . - Perform ? - Yeah . I used to go to theater camp as a kid and do plays and musicals , and it was freeing and fun . 
And then one day , around puberty , it was suddenly terrifying and not so fun , so I stopped . 
But I don 't know . I think ... I think underneath the fear , there 's joy . And I wanna try it again . 
Be bold . 
At least once . 
I like that one . 
Okay , what 's the last one ? 
Was that not five ? - No . No , it was not . - Oh . Um ... 
I guess I 'll steal Tristan 's . 
Threesome , baby ! 
- Threesome . 
- Let 's go . 
I am almost out . 
Me too . To the Pelican Deck ! 
What ? This is your room ? 
- They gave you a suite ? - Come on ! 
Is this a sofa ? I mean , do you even use this ? 
Of course I do . It 's where I sit down to put on my socks . 
A sofa to put socks on . That is going on my bucket list . Kitesurfing can do one . 
Dr. Odyssey , I believe it is your turn . Go . 
Right . Yes . 
Bucket item number one I wanted to see the world , or at least a new side of it . And here I am . Voilà . 
And ... - Thank you . - Item number two ... 
Most welcome . 
I would like to fall in love and have kids . Teach them to be self-reliant . 
We 're so dependent upon technology and convenience these days . 
I want to teach them to rely on themselves . 
Don 't mind if I do . 
That 's a good one . 
All right , two more . 
I would like for my life to have meaning . 
It 's so quick , you know ? 
It 's just like a little pebble dropped into a pond and then ... ... gone forever . 
But just like a pebble , there are ripples , and I want my ripples to mean something . 
God , you guys are both so boring ... 
Sorry , grown-up . 
All right , it 's fair . 
But last one . Please , come up with something fun . 
I can 't think of anything . 
- Yes , you can ! 
Come on . You 've got one . - Okay . Hold on , hold on . 
- Okay . 
- I 'm sorry ! 
- I 'll get back . Let me think about it . - Oh . 
You 're stalling ! - I 'm sorry . 
No , no . - This is a safe place . 
Dr. Odyssey , you-you can tell us if it 's a threesome . 
Actually , that particular box has been checked . 
What ? - Oh . Out with it , every detail . 
I 'm a little insulted that you 're both so surprised . 
- I was kind of a hot ticket in college . - Yeah , good one . 
I mean , I wasn 't enough of a hot ticket ' cause ultimately , they were way more interested in each other than they were in me . 
I was more of an audience member than I was a participant . 
Oh . Two girls ? 
A girl and a guy ? 
Sadly , the rest of the details will have to remain a mystery . 
I made a pact . I am sworn to secrecy . And I am very good friends with both of them to this day . 
Yeah , that tracks . 
So the final ... the final bucket list item : Have a good threesome . 
Okay , fine . 
I 'll give up learning French for that . Have a good threesome . 
I mean , I 'm game . 
Yeah . Right , Avery . 
It 's on all our ... lists .
