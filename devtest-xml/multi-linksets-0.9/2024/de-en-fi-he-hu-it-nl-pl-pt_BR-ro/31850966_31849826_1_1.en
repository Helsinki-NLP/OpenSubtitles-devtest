You 're kidding , right ? 
I 'm a nurse . I 've worked here for three years . 
You really don 't recognize me ? 
That 's not the issue , baby doll . You 're not getting on without a crew ID . 
I had it . I just ... 
I lost it . Come on . I gave you that corticosteroid cream last summer when you got sunburn in Ensenada . 
Remember that spot on your back that you couldn 't reach ? 
Yeah , I remember . 
But you 're not flirting your way onto my ship , Romeo . 
I 'm not losing my job ' cause you 're not responsible . - Avery . She 's a nurse . - She can vouch for me . 
Hi , Rhonda . Hey . Unless she got a crew badge in her back pocket with your picture on it ... You left it at the grab-n-go . It was on the counter by those weird boner pills . 
She 's joking . Thank you , Rhonda . 
- I loathe you . 
- You 're obsessed with me . 
By the way , it was not by the boner pills . 
So you ready ? The three amigos back in action for another season ? 
More like the two amigos and Mr. Magoo . 
Speaking of Magoo , have you heard from Dr. Campbell at all ? 
No . I was waiting for his usual preseason protocol manifesto e-mail , but I never got anything . 
You don 't think that he ... - Kicked the bucket ? - Yeah . Magoo ? No . 
He 's a cockroach . He could walk out of a plane crash without a scratch . 
Hello , gang . 
Welcome back . Take a walk with me . 
Six hours to showtime for this season 's maiden voyage and still about a day and a half worth of work to do . - Katherine . 
- Captain . But it all comes together . Somehow it does every year . 
Captain , sorry , where 's Dr. Campbell ? 
He 's no longer with us , I 'm sorry to say . 
Relax , guys . He 's not dead . 
Had to let him go . 
Thanks , Alan . 
After that debacle that happened last year , our special guest came aboard ... 
Bacterium yersinia enterocolitica . 
Yeah , well , you don 't have to remind me of the gory details . 
I saw a lady using a sunhat as a vomit bag . 
- Charming . 
- Sorry , captain . 
Refunds all around . Two more voyages canceled while we cleaned and sanitized . 
And the contact tracers said if we 'd just caught it one day earlier . I told Dr. Campbell that guy did not have appendicitis . 
Which is why he is no longer in charge of the health on my ship . 
The cruising world of today has to exceed passengers ' expectations . 
We live in very uncertain times , wars and worldwide pandemics , and nobody is going to venture out for anything less than total perfection , or we get replaced by virtual reality go-bot sex-dolls on a virtual cruise on a virtual pacific 
where there are no diseases and no employees . 
- Mary ? - Captain ? 
Dear , you got a little something right there . 
Bottom line is we in this business have to be at the apex of our game . 
No more mistaking bacterial outbreaks for appendicitis . 
Sebastian . Right ? 
- You 're new up here . 
- Yes , sir . Let me show you how to fold these towels . 
I can 't work under some new old quack . 
We should be running this department , us . 
- We 're the only ones who care . 
Tell him . Captain , you made the right call letting Dr. Campbell go . If I may , I 'm a nurse practitioner . I 've had the same amount of training as a doctor . I 'm legally qualified to be head medic . 
I want to nominate myself for the position . 
I very highly second that nomination , captain . 
Thank you , Avery . Tristan . I 'm very well aware and very grateful for your years of service on the odyssey . 
But in this case , the decision 's already been made . 
Out of 110 applicants , we found him . Dr. Max bank man . 
Graduated Yale top of his class . 
Served four years in the peace corps in west Africa . 
He developed some sort of new technique for cleft palate surgery . 
Won a prize from the u.N. For humanitarianism or something crazy . And he served on the pediatric board for Johns Hopkins . 
Captain with all due respect , he sounds overqualified . 
Yeah , well , after last year , I 'll take overqualified as to under any day . 
Now , he 's arriving shortly . 
So I trust that the two of you will make it a smooth transition . 
This guy must be 100 years old . 
Hi . 
I don 't have my badge yet . I 'm Max bank man , the new doctor . 
I 'm Rhonda Cole . 
Go ahead , baby . 
I got you . 
And there he is now . 
Doctor , welcome aboard the odyssey . 
And since they 're seemingly catatonic , allow me to introduce you to Avery and Tristan . 
You must be my brilliant and capable nurses . 
We are the ship 's brilliant and capable nurses , yes . 
I 'm , in fact , an n.P. 
Nurse practitioner . 
Of course . 
I 'm sorry . 
Do you have ... Any ... 
Bags ? I do , but they come with their own guys . 
Perfect . 
Shall we ? 
That 's going right in there . 
When I was working in Tanzania , the villages there kijiji , they call them ... I learned two things one , what you can do with a rudimentary setup , and , two , what you can 't do , which is why I 've asked to make a couple of modifications around here . 
Yeah . Everything here is state-of-the-art . 
- Nice . 
- What the hell ? 
- Big man , is this a ... - dialysis machine , yeah . 
In a major hospital , they 'd only ever use it for patients with kidney failure , but let me tell you , it is a Swiss army knife . You could use it for anything . 
Hemoperfusion for toxic congestions . Managing fluid overload in patients with heart failure . Crrt for the critically ill . It 's amazing . 
" When I was working in the va-na-na of Africa . " What is he , Bruce banner ? 
- Bruce Wayne ? - He 's not wrong . 
I 've been saying we should have a dialysis machine for years . 
This guy could be practicing medicine anywhere on earth , but he wants to practice it here ? On a floating theme park ? 
Mnh-mnh . It says here my cabin 's on the pelican deck . 
- It 's Tristan , right ? 
- Yes . You think you could show me the way ? 
It would be my utter delight . Please . 
This is not a corner of the world I 'm used to practicing medicine in . 
So what does bring you to this corner of the world ? 
I mean , a guy like you could practice anywhere , right ? 
Seems like it has its perks . 
I don 't know . What do you like about it ? 
You know the secret they don 't want us to tell all the guests ? 
She belongs to us . 
This ship , this life , it 's ours . We just let them try it on for a week . 
When the sun goes down , when we get back to port , it 's our turn . 
Work like a captain . Play like a pirate . 
The odyssey philosophy . 
She 's ours . 
Wow . I could get used to this . 
Captain 's dinner 's at 8 : 00 . It 's formal , which does not mean Hawaiian shirt . 
I found that out the hard way . Black tie . 
- Thank you . - Yeah . And thanks for showing me around . 
Mhm . 
I 'm excited . Yeah . It 's a big ol ' bucket of fun . 
Why am I here ? 
It 's the same as you . It 's work-life balance . 
I 've always been really good at the work part , - but now it 's time for ... 
- Life . - Yeah . - Yeah , you 'll get it alright . 
It 'll throw itself at you when you least expect it . Watch your back . 
Maybe we can watch each other 's back . 
Yeah . I 'm not gonna be like your wingman , dude . 
Sorry . It 's nothing personal . It 's just ... 
Maths . It 's just the guy-to-girl ratio is , what , like three to one ? 
It 's every man for himself . 
Come on . I mean , you 've already got this suite , you 're a doctor . 
You have a head start . 
Into the wild blue yonder . 
This is a cutting edge ring that wirelessly monitors your vitals . 
Get a 500 mil saline back ... he needs to be rehydrated , - and 4 mg of zofran . 
- On it . 
- Sorry I 'm late . 
- Where were you ? - I got turned around . 
- Ma 'am , is that your husband ? 
- Yes . - I need you to tell me everything that 's happened right from the very beginning . 
She 's already given a statement . It 's in his chart . 
We were at the Margarita mixer , the send-off , and Burt said he was feeling funny , and then he just started - doing that . 
- Okay , team . 
How are we gonna tackle this ? First things first , differential diagnosis : 
List the symptoms , name the associated conditions , narrow it down from there . 
Excuse me , sir . 
We have conjunctivitis , a rash . That would be symptomatic of a allergic reaction . 
The vomiting would seem to suggest something ingested . 
- Food allergy , maybe ? 
- He doesn 't have food allergies . 
The margaritas at the send-off mixer tasted weird . - Like pennies , sort of . 
- Interesting . Margaritas don 't have any common allergens , but metallic taste can be associated with certain medications . Antibiotics like azithromycin ? So what do we have : An allergen , something ingested , metallic taste ? 
Adverse reaction to an oral antibiotic 
- is where I put my money . - Nice . A reasonable deduction ... 
- taking any antibiotics . - Which he is ... - Not . 
- Mr. and Mrs. Rubens , before going to the mixer , did you by any chance stop by the seafood buffet ? 
Honey , you know I love a cocktail ... a shrimp cocktail . 
This is the life . 
Have I died ? Have I died and gone to hog heaven ? 
- Cheers ! 
- Cheers ! We had some shrimp . 
But he 's not allergic to shrimp . 
We love seafood . 
He 's not having an allergic reaction . Not to the shrimp , nor to any antibiotics . 
This happens at least once a trip . 
Shrimp contain iodine . You eat too much shrimp too quickly and it can lead to iodine poisoning . 
You 'd have to eat a hell of a lot of it happens to baby seals , too , which is why we call this little ailment seal disease . 
Give him 2 mg of ativan . 
My poor little seal pup ! 
So what are you gonna do ? 
Well , Mr. Rubens , we are gonna have to pump your stomach . 
But don 't worry , we 're gonna have you feeling great by tomorrow morning . Quick deduction work back there . 
Well done . We see a lot of different things on cruises . We also see a lot of the same things . 
Your office has a library with a good section on maritime medicine . You may want to study up . 
Will there be a quiz ? 
You 're living it . 
Sorry I 'm late , captain . 
I 've been catching up on the various cruise ship maladies that afflict cruise ship people . 
" Cruise ship people " ? 
You mean ... As in people having too much fun ? 
Never in my life did I consider that it was possible for a human to eat enough shrimp to give themselves iodine poisoning . 
Now , doctor ... You cannot judge our passengers . We 're tending to their dreams . 
We have folks on here who have saved for years , sometimes their whole lives , just to pay for this experience at sea . 
And other than the birth of their child , or in some cases , their weddings ... This will be the most exciting week of their entire lives , and it 's our job to guarantee that . 
Understood . 
See , our mission is to preserve the dream . 
And you 're here to keep these dreamers safe . 
You might think of yourself as a ... - Guardian angel . 
- A guardian what now ? 
Guardian angel ! We make it look perfect so that resistance isn 't even a possibility . 
And why should it be ? 
There should be zero guilt on a pleasure cruise . 
Now , you may think that , the staff we have up here in the white shorts running around are glorified extras from a country club ... But make no mistake about it , they are certified the best . 
You don 't get to be on my ship without hours and hours of intensive training in hospitality and scuba and cpr . 
The best of the best . 
Sometimes we even apply sunscreen because , out here , there are no sunburns . 
This is about as far from hell as you can get . 
This ship ? This ship is heaven . 
Usually we 're about three hours from land , so medivac in the deep ocean is not even a possibility . 
So it 'll be your job to keep everyone alive . 
That 's a terrifying burden . It comes with enormous responsibility ... 
So we have to be prepared for terrible things to happen . 
And you can 't begrudge these mishaps , these accidents . 
Speaking of mishaps and accidents , I have to go . 
But , captain ? 
I hear you . And thank you . 
- What happened ? 
- It ... 
It broke . He 's in shock . 
What broke , Mr. Airington ? 
- Penile fracture . 
- You can 't fracture your ... - It 's not actually a bone . 
- Broken fascia , the membrane beneath the skin that connects the erectile chambers . 
Little pressure . The only treatment is surgery . 
It 's a quick procedure . 15 minutes . I 'm in and out . Local anesthetic . 
We can 't do surgery on board . It 's against code . 
Policy is we coordinate with the nearest port except in cases of emergency . 
Every second that you lose blood is a second you lose the opportunity for a full recovery . - We need to act now . 
- Do what you need to do , doctor . 
Get him prepped . 
We got this . So , the blood from his erection is pooled at the base of his penis . 
We can 't do anything until we evacuate the hematoma . 
Scalpel . 
Generally speaking , a penile fracture happens during intercourse when the receiving party is on top , vigorously moving up and down , and then they pull out too far ... 
And you learned this in the peace corps ? 
Absolutely not . 
Premed . Leandra . 
Suture . 
- Who 's leandra suture ? - Sutures . Stitches . 
Leandra is the woman who taught me about penile fracture . 
Sophomore year , toga party . 
I 'm sorry , wait . You broke your ... ? Before you get too excited , I should probably tell you it really only happens to the larger , firmer members . 
That 's wholly inappropriate . 
Knock , knock . Room service . 
Leftovers from the captain 's dinner . 
How you feeling ? 
Like I snapped my pee pee in half and had it stitched back together . 
Unfortunately , we are gonna have to keep you in here overnight and then monitor that throughout the rest of the week . 
Well , how long until he can ... you know ? Yeah . Sorry . No more knocking boots or booties for at least four to six weeks . 
Man , I 'm sorry , babe . 
I ruined the honeymoon cruise . 
You know ... Intimacy is infinitely nuanced . 
We 're in manzanita the day after tomorrow . 
I know a woman there , a tantric therapist . 
She works with couples , helps them explore deeper levels of connection through touch , breath work ... Pleasure centers . 
Pleasure centers ? 
Mhm . I mean , I 'm not not interested . 
Okay . 
Wonderful . - Enjoy your dinner . - Thank you . 
- Help ! 
He 's not breathing ! - He 's not breathing ! Back ! Back . 
Get everybody back . - Help ! He can 't breathe ! 
- Give them some space . He can 't breathe ! 
- What happened ? 
- I told her to wait , one at a time , but she jumped in right after him . I ... 
I wanted to do it together ! 
Is he gonna be okay ? 
Burt ? Burt , can you hear me ? 
Burt , breathe ! 
Breathe , Burt ! Burt ! Burt ! Hang in there , buddy ! 
Hang in , burty-Burt ! No , you didn 't kill him , madam . 
When you knocked into your husband , his clavicle separated from his sternum , punctured a hole in his windpipe . 
That 's why he 's having trouble breathing . 
- A hole in his wind ... - they 're inserting a tracheal tube to make sure he gets all the oxygen he needs . 
He 'll be breathing in no time . 
I know we were supposed to lay low after he caught the seal disease , but we were just so excited to be here and just have more fun . - Don 't worry , ma 'am . - We 've had it from here . 
But h-how will you making him better for ... for good ? 
He needs advanced thoracic surgery to put his clavicle back in place . 
We 're not equipped to do that . This isn 't stitching up a penis . 
Well , we 're in puerto vallarta in six hours . I can contact ems there . 
We can 't just keep him here all night like this . 
Any delay in treatment could cause serious vascular damage . 
- We have to do ... 
Something . - In certain cases , the sternoclavicular joint could be manually manipulated . 
- That sounds extremely risky . 
- If it doesn 't work , it could severely exacerbate his condition . 
It would mean significantly longer recovery time . 
But ... It 's your call , doctor . 
No . 
It 's not . This procedure would take all of us . The decision has to be unanimous . 
If anybody has any reservations ... 
Avery , will you make a ramp , please ? 
Tristan ... I need you to grab him under the shoulders and brace his back with your knee . 
Now , on the count of three , I want you to rotate his shoulders counterclockwise . 
- One , two ... 
- but then I 'm pushing against you . That 's the point , Tristan . Rotate him . 
- One ... - It 's gonna snap 
- his shoulder blade . - Do it . 
Are you ready ? 
One ... two ... three . 
You good ? 
You know , I just don 't do well being bossed around . 
- Well , I am your boss , bud . - Yeah . And who is more experienced on this ship doing this ? 
Guys , not in front of the patient . Please . 
Any signs of life in the great beyond ? 
Just a big swirling ball of hot air directly overhead . 
So , is it ever the same ... 
Or is always , like ... A little bent ? 
Your penis . After you broke it . 
The body is a miraculous healing machine . That was good work today the tantric therapist in manzanita ? 
Lani . She 's amazing . 
She saved my life after a breakup a couple of years ago . 
Besides , it 's not enough just to fix ' em up here . - I have to also ... - Preserve the fantasy . 
Always . All the time . 
Tristan . He 's a good nurse . 
Don 't get hung up on first impressions . 
He 's been my right hand for three years . 
He knows a lot . He 's a valuable tool . 
He 's some kind of tool alright . 
You respect him , he 'll respect you . 
We 're all here for the same reason . 
" Work like a captain , play like a pirate " ? 
Yeah . Also that . 
So what about you ? What are your first impressions of the new doctor ? 
Well , admittedly , it was a little low after his misstep with the iodine poisoning , but ... Good recognizes good . The penile fracture , the clavicular relocation ? That was ... 
Decent . Well , I try . 
Bedtime . 
You too . First port tomorrow . 
The passengers are out of sight and mind for five hours . 
Thank god . 
All of which I will spend napping . 
No , you won 't . 
' Cause I 'd really rather not get fired on my second day . 
You 're not going to get in trouble , dude . Be cool . Bonfire basically is captain 's orders . 
As long as we 're back by dinner when the cruisers are done at port , we 're good . 
Hey , wallflower ! 
You good ? Just digesting the scenery . 
You need to loosen up , doc . 
And that means one thing ... shots . 
Alright . 
- Okay , okay . I see you . - I see you , Dr. Odyssey . 
Big kahuna . Whoo-hoo ! 
Playing nice , boys ? 
Yes , mother . Yes , we are . 
Man , I have a secret . 
But I can 't tell you . Ever . Sorry . 
Is it that you 're in love with Avery ? 
No . 
No , my god . Dude , no . No ! 
Don 't ever say that to anyone . You know , I 'm pretty good at keeping secrets . 
Hippocratic oath and all ? 
Step into my office . 
Talk to me . 
It is not good . 
Just , I ... I like her so much , man . 
You know ? I think I 've had it bad for , like , two years . 
It is rough . 
She always says to me like , " you 're like my little brother , " you know ? 
You know what , man ? I 'm never gonna give up hope . 
I refuse to move on . Ever . 
Well , that seems healthy . 
Well ... till then ... I must tend to my admirers . 
- Hi . - I think she 's looking at me . 
Yeah . 
Hi . Are you looking at him ... 
- I was looking at him . 
But you 're cute too . 
Get up . 
Get up . Had to happen sooner or later . 
Let 's go . - What 're you doing ? 
- Dance off , doc . Dance off , pants off . 
Who 's cute now , doc ? 
- This is wrong . 
- But it feels so good . 
But it 's wrong . We just met each other . 
And yet we feel as if ... We 've known each other all our lives . 
But it 's wrong . 
I know . I know ! I know . 
We need to be professional . 
This is the day drinking talking , not us . 
- Yeah , definitely not us . 
- Please don 't tell the captain . 
Yeah , I was just about to text him . 
Guests are back soon . 
Here . 
Sit up . 
What are you doing ? 
Nutrient drip ... electrolytes , b vitamins . 
This will do you a whole lot better than that nap you wanted . 
Doctor who 's afraid of needles ? 
So where 'd you learn to dance like that ? 
You know , I always wanted to take dance classes as a kid , but it 's not really something that boys do where I grew up . 
And then ... One day , I got tapped on the shoulder and gently reminded that life is fleeting and unbelievably fragile . 
March 2 , 2020 . I was working at a hospital in new haven , Connecticut . 
Yeah , we know , you went to Yale . 
Actually , I was the attending physician general in internal medicine , but who 's counting ? 
One day I get a cough . 
No big deal . But in an abundance of caution , I asked one of my residents to give me a strep and a flu test . 
Then that night , cough gets a little worse , but both the strep and flu tests come back negative . 
Then everybody gets worried that I 've had a pulmonary embolism . So they gave me a ct scan , check for a blood clot . 
But they also give me a new test a coronavirus test . 
Now , at that point , there were barely any cases in the U.S. , so I didn 't even think about it as a realistic possibility . But as I 'm sitting there waiting for the results of the ct scan , I found out ... on the news actually ... 
A hospital in new haven reporting . Connecticut 's first-ever case of the novel coronavirus . 
A physician who was admitted last night at j.D. Memorial ultimately testing positive for the virus . 
After that , everything moved very fast . 
They put me in a negative pressure isolation room , cut me off from all human contact . 
My blood oxygen dropped to 85 % and then kept on dropping . 
I refused to sleep ' cause I was afraid I wasn 't gonna wake up . 
And at that point in China , they were giving patients with advanced cases second ct scans , right , so they could chart the progression of the virus , the only way to ensure proper treatment . 
But there was a problem . I was in isolation on the ninth floor and the ct scanner was on the fourth floor and they were afraid to move me . 
Didn 't want to risk exposing the rest of the hospital . We are following CDC and evidence-backed protocols . 
You are staying in this room . 
And after that , I was just in total darkness . 
Just black . 
I thought I was dead , but dead people don 't pray because somewhere in the recesses of my consciousness , there was a voice , my voice , very faint , and I knew that I needed that second scan . 
So I just focused on that all day , every day , and I prayed . 
I prayed for them to give me the second scan , and they did , and the results from that scan got me approved for remdesivir for compassionate use , and that turned the tides . 
So against all odds , and despite being patient zero ... 
I lived . And because I lived and because I went through hell I decided that I was gonna pursue joy ... 
Which I guess is a very , very long-winded way of saying that I finally enrolled in a dance class . 
And then you came here . 
Thank you for sharing that . 
I will caution you , joy at any cost is its own kind of hell . 
Okay , do you want to you want to go to my cabin ? 
No . I 'm good here . 
Why ? 
Are you scared ? - No . No ! 
No , I 'm not scared . - I 'm just , like ... like , shy . 
Like , a little shy . I 'm not really into shy guys . 
No ... I 'm not . 
There 's no shyness . 
- What are you doing ? 
- I am Leo Brandt ! My god . 
The western surfing association champ - of hunting ton beach ! 
- Get down from there ! 
I 'm not shy ! I 'm king of the world ! 
Leo ! Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! 
I 'm right here ! Wait ! 
Full stop . 
Execute a Williamson turn . 
Man overboard . 
Get medical and security up here right away . Go ahead and drop the buoys and the flares . 
Hey , is this real ? Man overboard ? 
Yeah . It 's real . 
Thought your cabin was on the pelican deck . 
What brings you to this side of the crew quarters , doc ? 
House call ? 
Bad call , man . 
You 're a superior . You understand ? That 's like a fire able offense . 
We didn 't do anything . 
And even if we did , what are you gonna do ? Tattle on me ? 
I don 't know what I 'm gonna do , Judas . In case you hadn 't noticed , there 's more important things going on right now than your job . 
Please tell me what you guys took tonight . 
I 'm a nurse . You 're not in trouble . 
Molly . 
- Just a little . - So he may still be alert , as long as he survived the fall . 
- She needs hydration . 
- He 's not even into drugs . It was me . I mean , i-it was all my fault . 
That 's his job . He 's a good person . 
Is he gonna freeze to death like in " Titanic " ? - That 's a very good question . - What is the water temp tonight ? 
You 're supposed to know that , doctor . It 's in the daily weather briefings . 
Surface temp is 83 , maybe 80 . 
So anywhere between 2 and 12 hours before hypothermia sets in . 
It is unlikely that this is anything but recovery . 
Only 15 % of the people that go over survive . The fall alone usually kills them . 
Well , let 's hope he 's part of that 15 % . 
Captain , if he is out there , category four waves at night , it 's gonna be like finding a needle in a 100 square miles of hay . 
Sure is . 
Alert all the other ships in the vicinity . 
The current was headed east off the port side , so that 's the direction he will have drifted . 
Let 's get this guy . 
We 're over an eddy . 
- Those buoys , they were port side , but they come back around starboard . 
The current 's moving in a circle . We 're searching the wrong area . 
There ! 
He 's not responsive . 
We 've got him . 
Come on . 
- He 's good . We are en route . 
- Thank god . 
Oxygen . 
Get him oxygen ! Unconscious , breath is rapid and irregular . 
He aspirated a lot of water . 
- Could be ards . - Definitely ards . We need to get him intubated . 
His left arm is in bad shape . Possible proximal fracture . 
I 'm gonna get him prepped for an X-ray . 
Avery , you and Tristan get him on low-tidal volume . 
Let 's prepare to assist on ventilator using ardsnet protocol . 
Utilize the high peep , low fio2 table and closely monitor his peak inspiratory pressures . 
Okay , Leo . It 's gonna be alright . 
That was good work out there . 
And that dive was pretty epic . 
Well , if you hadn 't seen the buoys , I ... Look Tristan , I 'm sorry ... About ... You know . 
I shouldn 't have done that . Even though nothing happened , but ... 
Yes . And smart . - And maybe I 'm just a little ... - Screwed up ? 
Yeah . Who would want to work in a floating circus but someone who 's screwed up ? 
Besides comebacks are cooler anyways . 
What 's the first thing you said when you realized you 'd been rescued ? 
I think I said " I 'm sorry I 'm naked " ? 
We wanted to let you know that we met with your practitioner in manzanita . 
Was it okay ? 
It was not okay . 
- It was amazing . - Yeah . Thank you . This trip was awesome . 
- You are so welcome . 
- Do you totally hate us ? 
Of course not . Guests like you keep us sharp . 
Well , despite everything , we had a blast . 
- Can 't wait till next year . - Yeah ! Who knows ? Maybe you 'll get your leg chewed off by a shark . 
Exciting ! Bye . 
I thought I picked up on a little something the other night ... some tension in the medical suite , 
Dr. Odyssey ? Absolutely not . 
It 's a love fest , sir . Good . I love hearing that . 
Love is in the air . Just not too thickly or quickly . 
- I love fest , sir ? 
- About the other day , I should have done that . 
And I enjoyed it , but I shouldn 't have done it . 
- And I am your superior , so ... - We 're good . Won 't happen again . 
You were great this week . 
A real emergency doctor . On it . And , yeah . We 're good . 
Won 't happen again . 
Besides , we 'll have plenty other distractions next week . 
It 's singles week . Singles week ? Is every week a theme ?
