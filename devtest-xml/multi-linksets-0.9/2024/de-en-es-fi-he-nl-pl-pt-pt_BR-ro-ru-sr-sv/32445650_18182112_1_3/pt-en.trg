So we found it strange that we were making toys in February . 
We thought , toys in February ? Since when ? 
The Christmas holiday just happened . 
It was odd . But then we realized what we were making . 
- And what was that ? 
- Objection . Relevance ? Overruled . 
It was a toy . It was a ... forgive me . It was a sex toy . 
Please state your last name . Claus . 
First name . 
Mrs. 
How would you characterize your relationship with the plaintiff ? 
He 's an elf . He 's one of my husband 's elfs . 
Elfs ? Elves ? 
I don 't know . Sorry . 
- He 's one of many . Sorry . - It 's okay . 
I 'm feeling a little nervous . 
I 'm more of a behind-the-scenes gal . 
That 's okay . 
Do you know Dodo ? Yes . 
We 're all family . 
That 's what I thought , at least , if you ask me . 
Him and the other ones would come over for dinner , small parties , Christmas parties . 
It 's at one of these parties where Dodo found a present . 
He was instructed to create a strap-on . 
He alleges it was in your home for personal use . 
Elves make the toys . My husband delivers the toys . The toys are his responsibility . 
And it 's our responsibility , as for all the presents , that we ensure the quality and we test them out ourselves . 
I gladly tested it on Santa for Christmas . 
Sorry . Behind-the-scenes gal . That 's okay . 
Dodo alleges elves are made to work for free . 
Not for free . 
For the love of Christmas . 
And can you share with us what Dodo said at one of these parties ? 
He said ... and he was tipsy . I 'll give him that . This one can sure drink a lot of eggnog . He said , " God , I hate Christmas . " 
I was devastated . I still haven 't recovered , if you ask me . 
And I think that 's why he 's on this social-justice-warrior kick . 
He hates Christmas . Don 't you ? 
Tell ' em the truth . 
I don 't like that Dodo . He wants to cancel Christmas , for Christ 's sake . 
Okay , so you 're interested in corporeal service . - Yes . 
- You want to get rid of your body ? - I would like to get rid of my body , yes . - Okay , great . 
Well , let me tell you a little bit about us . 
New Solutions Incorporated specializes in mind-upgrading services and are certified by official agencies nationwide . 
- Our incorp ... - Sorry , like the FDA ? - No . Let me finish . - Sorry . Our incorporeal service can free you of your daily bodily ailments and discomforts . 
" Without a body , I have never felt more like myself . " Jonathan R. , Brooklyn . 
- I can read it ... 
- " Service was fast and easy . 
I left feeling better than I had in years . " Sam K. , Manhattan . 
Do you have change for $ 20 ? I just got some dumplings . 
We 're here to help people just like you get rid of the burden of having a body . 
You just float around . 
It says here that you 're battling a skin disease . Yes . 
I 'm actually a little worried about this . 
I 'm sorry . 
It 's really bad . But you don 't have to worry about that . You don 't have to worry about a thing . You don 't even have to worry about getting an apartment because you won 't have a body . You 'll just be floating around . 
- Like a ghost ? - Let me finish . You will be floating around like a freed mind . 
And you ever feel , like , hungry , or , after you eat food , you 're , like , bloated ? 
Sure . Yeah . - Yes . 
- See ? That wouldn 't happen if we upload you . 
Hey , I got to get this . 
Hello ? Yes , this is the real bank . 
- I got a call saying ... - Hey . Hey , can you get this ? 
- Oh , I don 't know what the ... 
Everything is in the brochure . 
- Yeah ? - Okay . Yes . Yes , I 'll just need your full name and account number . Right now we are offering a promotional fee of $ 999 a month because you are a preferred customer . 
That 's nice . For how long ? 
Initial 10-year commitment . 
And if I stop paying , I can just return to my body ? 
No . No , you can 't . Can 't do it . So , sorry , I guess the question is , if I upload my consciousness into the ether and I become this little light for a fee , if I stop paying that fee , where does my consciousness ... go ? 
That 's between you and your pastor . - We don 't do that . 
- Well , to sign you up , we just need your credit card to put on file and then a copy of your proof of existence . 
I don 't ... Wait . I 'm sorry . 
I need to prove that I exist so I can stop existing ? 
It 'll be real fast . We 'll swipe it . All you need is proof . That 's it . 
I don 't have it because I don 't want it , is the issue . Wait , so ... How do you have an apartment ? How do you take out a loan ? 
They 're going to be asking for it soon to get on the subway . You never knew you needed until now ! I even heard you 'll need it to vote soon . Toilets . 
It breaks my heart to see them naked , undignified , shivering in the cold as they swallow our daily filth . 
That 's why I 've dedicated my life to fashioning toilet dresses . 
You see , every toilet is a she . And she , she ought to be dressed . 
Go . 
Yes , her favorite holiday is Thanksgiving . The turkey one . 
And her ? Well , she woke up early just to bake bread with her two ugly daughters . 
Daydreaming of a Hawaiian honeymoon with a man she 'll never meet . 
What the hell are you doing ? 
Not the cowgirl . 
She 's private . 
People are always asking me , 
Denise , I tried to go to your website , and I couldn 't find the online shop . 
And I say , don 't be an idiot . I don 't have an online shop . 
You know that . You have to call me personally at home , and you need to ask for a consultation . 
Then I 'll come to your home when you least expect it but when it 's convenient for me , and I 'll have a moment with your toilet . 
Feel its skin . Feel its gurgles . Hear it roar . 
She wants a sequined seat . 
- Won 't that hurt ? 
I don 't want to sit on sequins . 
" Won 't that hurt ? " You are an idiot . 
This one doesn 't mind being the other woman . And her , I 'm not ready to discuss . 
My dedication to this cause began back when I was a little girl . 
I live alone with my grandmother , so you know my childhood was excellent . 
Put your pants up , you vile , vile girl . 
My life is hard , and it 's your fault ! 
I dump all my shit on you . 
Thank you to my producers for making that flashback happen . 
Okay , well , don 't make a whole show of it . 
Toilets need love . Toilets didn 't ask to be toilets . 
Toilets need to be dressed , and they need to look good . 
But please don 't call here and be asking how much it costs , okay ? Just book a fucking consultation . 
Good night . 
Bibo will get the door . 
" Skin cancer . How long to kill ? " 
Thank you , sir . Keep the change . 
How about this apartment ? 
No ? 
Oh , I 've been there . 
That 's too small . But this one . How about this ? 
Bibo , don 't move . 
- I detect an incoming call . 
- Thank you , Bibo . 
- Hello ? - Julio , may I speak to you ? 
- Right now ? - Can we talk ? 
No , sorry . No , not you . 
Now 's a good time for me , and I need to tell you ... - Yeah , this is he . 
- Julio ? 
- Hello ? - Hello . 
So was your mother a rice cooker or a vacuum cleaner ? 
Angrysound.mp3 . 
Oh , Bibo , relax . It 's a human joke . 
Okay , okay , it was the venue . They have a lead on the oyster . 
If they find it , I can get a biopsy , like , today . 
What you need is an apartment . No , what I need is to know what I 'm dealing with . 
And I 'll only know what I 'm dealing with if I can get the oyster . 
Julio , I can 't do this . I can 't spiral with you . 
Remember when we were in college and you thought you had internal bleeding because you were spitting blood but you just weren 't flossing ? I don 't know why you 're bringing that up . 
I don 't know what that has to do with anything . This is nothing like that . It 's just nothing like the flossing . 
This is just like that . 
You always do this . 
Hello ? 
Vanesja . Hello ? 
Your Chase Bank account has been compromised . 
Oh , no . 
Okay , I haven 't found your little golden oyster , but I think I know where it might be . 
- Have you ever heard of Fufu 's ? 
Fufu 's was the first and only queer hamster nightclub in New York City . 
Fufu 's was like Studio 54 meets Berghain but for gay hamsters . 
It was the only space that was just for them , where they could walk in , dance , misbehave , and forget about the tedious , endless loop of their exercise wheels . 
At Fufu 's , you 'd see hamsters in fetish wear , hamster couples eyeing a third and disappearing into a dark room or arguing about dropping the coke . 
- Where is it ? - Fuck ! I 'm so stupid . - Babe , did you drop the coke ? 
- Don 't get mad . 
There was no easier place to score drugs - than at the Fufu 's bathroom . - So stupid . 
Where is it ? Where is the baggie ? 
I hear your boyfriend 's toxic . Want to make out with me ? 
- They let me work the coat check . - Alex , chica ! 
Oh , my God . Hi ! So good to see you . 
Just one ? - Yeah , one item . - It 's $ 5 . Oh , my God . 
I could buy more items for that much money . 
Fufu 's was owned by a sweet old queen named Pompolino . 
He named the club after his late partner Fufu , who died at the hands of a merciless seven-year-old who forgot to feed him . 
His new boyfriend , who was young and power hungry , was named Coco and had big plans for Fufu 's . 
We should do brunches in the day . Bottomless-mimosa brunch . 
Babe , that 's not what Fufu 's is . 
We should make it a chain , open more Fufu 's , and team up with brands to do big sponsored events . 
- Do a bump . - Sponsored events ? We should charge a really high cover to make sure hamsters that come in can afford the drinks . Come on , babe ! This is smart . 
Babe , Fufu was for family , queer family . - You should do a bump . - Babe , I do not want more cocaine . 
We should invite Antoni from " Queer Eye . " We should invite Anderson Cooper . We should invite Spock . 
Which one 's Spock ? Babe , he 's a human . 
Who cares ? Humans are cool . Do a bump . 
- Babe , Fufu would not have liked that . 
- Fufu 's dead . 
I had nothing to do with it , no matter what the police say . And I 'm going to take this place to the next level . 
Fufu 's turned into a CVS the next day . 
That 's so sad . 
Anyway , the hamster CVS is under the DJ booth . 
I think your little oyster might have rolled over there . 
- Following guest . - Hey , hey . Hi , hi . Okay , so my name is Julio . 
Okay , I was wondering if maybe you found a little ... well , little for me , but sizable for you ... golden diamond-encrusted oyster . 
- An oyster ? - Yes . 
Well , it 's an earring in the shape of an oyster , - with diamonds . 
- Okay . - Hey , Chips ! - Yes ? 
Chips here . 
Have you seen a golden oyster with diamonds ? 
- Yes . I can help you . - Oh , yeah ? 
Okay , a customer was here yesterday saying he lost his sweater here . 
So I brought out the lost and found , and he saw exactly what you 're describing . - The golden oyster , was it ? - Yes . Yes . 
And then the customer said , " Oh , yes . That 's my sweater . " 
- And I gave it to him . - What ? 
And where does he work ? 
Why are you wearing that ? 
Not allowed to have phones in school . 
I don 't go here . 
Then why are you here ? 
Because I 'm waiting for class to be over so I can yell at a hamster . 
Don 't let him get to you . 
Oh , I 'm okay . I don 't ... 
Did you like school ? - No . - Why ? 
Because it 's a horrible , oppressive environment . 
Did kids make fun of you ? 
No . 
Is it ' cause you 're gay ? 
That 's maybe like a symptom , but , no . 
I don 't know . Just different priorities . 
How do you mean ? 
It 's a little Oprah here . I don 't know . I didn 't like school because it felt like a competition to see who could fit in the most . 
And I started at a deficit and could never catch up , no matter how hard I tried . 
You see , my family inherited a lot of debt when my grandfather died , and we had to move just to avoid the debt collectors , and we couldn 't have nice things . 
The kids at school sniffed out that something was off . 
" Why does your car look like that ? Why do your clothes look like that ? " 
Until eventually I said , " Guess what . Joke 's on you . I don 't want to fit in . " I don 't want what you have . 
I didn 't get invited to the party . 
That party isn 't even on my radar . 
I 'm not at the bottom of the pyramid . I 'm not in the pyramid . 
I 'm not losing the race , idiot . I 'm not running at all . I 'm not even watching the race . I 'm over here , very relaxed and highly at ease . I 'm different . I am my own thing . " I 'm the exception . " 
So , no , I don 't need proof of existence . What I need is my own special , little quest . 
So , to me , this whole quest you 're on , this whole maze you 've put yourself in , it 's all a distraction from the brutal reality that , like the rest of us , you 'll have to sacrifice some of what you believe in , some of your precious individuality that became your armor to survive in a system that hurt you . You 'll have to play by its rules to some extent to keep surviving in this world . 
And you know you 're not sick . You 're just scared of facing that the walls are closing in . 
But what happens after the biopsy , huh ? 
What happens when you no longer have this to face the world ? 
You 're going to find some other thing to distract you ? 
Figaro ? 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi . What 's up ? 
Hand over the diamonds . I 'm sorry . Diamonds ? 
Yeah , I don 't know what you 're talking about . 
- Where is the oyster ? - Oh , my God . 
Oh , you mean my sweater . Okay . 
- Yeah , yeah . - Sure . Where is it ? 
- Okay , it is coming back to me now . - That 's nice . Where is it ? 
Listen , sir , I 'm still rattled from a near-death experience . 
Just get on with it , Figaro . 
Okay , relax . God . 
I lost the diamonds when I had a close encounter with hell 's mouth . 
That 's what we call toilets in my culture . 
What is the issue ? 
The funds will be wired from Europe . 
Hello ? 
Where are you ? 
I 'm in a middle-school bathroom looking for the oyster . 
I have exciting news . 
They only do remakes now , and they want you to adapt the Tooth Fairy . 
- Something fun for the whole familia . 
- I already told them my idea . 
So I hear you 're looking for a fun , family friendly summertime movie about the Tooth Fairy . 
Well , you got it . My idea would be a story about addiction . 
We find this young fairy , alone , shivering , cold and gaunt , stealing quarters from his father , a fairy plumber . They live in a tree , but in their world , this is sort of like a tenement-style building . 
Later , we learn that he 's stealing the quarters in order to fund his addiction ... human teeth , children 's teeth . 
The fairy dies at the end . 
Is this movie going to make a lot of money ? 
No , but you didn 't become an executive to make money . 
I think they want something more palatable . 
Hold on , my little star . Someone 's calling . 
This is the bank calling you regarding some leaked photographs . 
You again ? 
Okay . Well , now back to finding the oyster . 
I am the water . 
I am here but also there . 
I am the water . Rushing over here . 
Cleaning over there . 
Hydrating everywhere . 
Toilets make me dizzy . 
What was your question ? 
I 'm about to rain ... 
Oh , yes , your oyster . 
I felt it going down my throat , through my very being , and eventually to my sea . 
- Hello ? - God , I 've been waiting for four hours . 
- Hold , please . - No ! 
Do not fucking put me ... 
I fucking hate Halloween . Don 't even get me started , girl . 
Seeing those gross little kids and their fake mermaid tails . 
Hello , appropriation much ? 
Yeah , like , I don 't want to see your sad little sneakers poking out of your green skirt . 
Because that 's what it is . It 's a skirt . 
Like , that 's not a tail , mama . 
If you 're going to commit to the look , commit to the look . 
Yeah , and drag yourself from door to door with your tail . 
Or , like , make a papier mÃ ¢ chÃ © rock and have your parents , I don 't know , wheel you around . 
Wait , that 's a really good idea . 
That 's genius . 
- Should we make them ? - Yeah . 
I can make a website . I can design the logo right now . 
But I feel like we should make the product first . 
Okay , well , here we go again . 
Should we be getting ahead of ourselves ? 
That 's why you never get anything done . 
Am I being , like , too much ? No , you 're just pushing me ' cause you 're a good friend . 
You 're a really good friend . 
My therapist says I need to stop drinking . 
My therapist says you need to stop drinking , too . 
Vanesja . This is Vanesja . 
Hello ? Your savings account has been compromised . 
Yes , I 'm the real bank . Yes , I 'm the bank . 
Enough . Who does this ? 
Hello ? Hello ? Hello . 
I 'm Oscar , 42 , Brooklyn , New York . 
This is my dream for analysis . 
For some background information , my sister and I own and run an internet cafÃ © . 
Well , I 'm in charge mostly . She 's now busy with new ventures . 
We 're in a substantial amount of debt . 
You see , last summer , I walked into our father . He was passed out , and I had just heard about a heat-wave warning on the radio , so , naturally , I called an ambulance . 
At the ER , the doctor said he was just taking a nap . 
But we got slammed with the bill for the ambulance ride nevertheless . Never mind that we live a block away from the hospital and spent most of the 45-minute ride looking for parking . 
Anywho , we owe a lot of money now , so Vicky has a few side hustles . 
She has a franchise for this body-uploading thing . She sells Clinique products and makes some , well , scam calls , all while I run the internet cafÃ © , which ... doesn 't make a ton of money . 
From my computer screen , I can see the computer screen of every customer 's screen . 
They 're mostly checking their emails , paying their bills , playing games . But I have to keep an eye on anyone watching pornography or doing any risky activities . 
And that is where the dream comes in . 
In the dream , well , I was here at work , sitting at my desk , doing my job . 
But this time I saw from my screen that Vicky is looking at this leather jacket . 
And the jacket has this zipper , this nonfunctional zipper , and I am the zipper . 
And the reviews all say , " Do not buy . Zipper does not open . Zipper just for decoration . " 
And I 'm like , you know , just because I 'm a zipper doesn 't mean that I 'm , well , functional . 
You have reached the dream interpretation 24-hour hotline . 
Your dream is not ready at this time . Please check back again later . 
Proof of existence . 
I hear troubled thinking . What is it , my little star ? 
I can 't get a biopsy because I haven 't found the little oyster , and I can 't even upload myself because even they asked for proof of existence . 
- Proof of existence . - Oh , no . 
Proof of existence is a new form of ID and only $ 5 per month that combines all forms of identification . - Bibo , you have an Alexa in you ? 
- Humiliating . 
Now , this I can use . 
There 's a huge market for transsexualism . Okay . 
Proof has teamed up with the government to require this ID at bars , airports , apartment leases , loans , and venues by the end of the year via proofreading machines , which are to be installed this month on public transit . 
To get proof , you must prove good credit , employment history , et cetera , or become an exception . 
Wait , exception . Yes , that 's me , exception . 
To become an exception , you must submit documents of extraordinary ability , such as mainstream fame , as a household name like BeyoncÃ © or the Minions . 
I know a job that can help you achieve this . But if you do it , you need to promise me you 'll use it to get an apartment and not to upload yourself . 
But what about the mole ? 
I have connections . 
We could get it biopsied . It could be a performance . 
Okay , what 's the job ? 
I 'll do it . I 'll do it as long as I don 't have to succumb to that horrible , horrible system . 
So , whatever this job is , I 'll do it . 
- It 's a credit-card commercial ... 
- I won 't do it . 
Targeting young people called ChaChing . 
And you have to wear a rainbow Pride suit ... and a sombrero ... 
Oh , my God . 
And maracas .
