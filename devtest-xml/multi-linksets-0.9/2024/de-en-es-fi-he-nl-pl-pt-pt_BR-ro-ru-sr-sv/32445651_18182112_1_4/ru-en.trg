I 'm a little teapot , scalding hot . 
Here is my handle . - Here ... - Sorry , sorry . I just really don 't want to do the credit card commercial . 
But this always works . 
What if I become an exception doing something else ? 
Like , um ... like a master class on hand acting . 
Handing out a check for a dirty job . 
Putting an end to it and finally signing the divorce papers . 
The death of a wise elder . 
Protect the girl . 
Receiving upsetting news from the henchman . Got away , boss . 
Making sure he drinks the poison . 
That 's not going to make you an exception . 
Do the credit card commercial . 
They 're woke , and they 're called Cha-Ching , and representation matters . Sure . 
And I think I actually made a good point earlier . 
No . 
All these men and their numbers . There 's just too many cocktails . 
Ah , yes . 
Big banks need your voice , because , like , if not you , then some person who 's not gonna advocate for change or rights . 
And did I mention representation matters ? 
They 're funded by ExxonMobil . Oh , my God . 
Julio , I 'm trying . 
OK , I 've got another gig , but it 's a big kahuna . It 's for a superhero produced by Zappos . Another remake . 
I mean , would I even have a chance for something like that ? The superhero thingy ? Of course you do . 
What does one need to get cast in those things , anyway ? 
To , like , be a superhero ? I don 't know . 
Like , a shit ton of followers , rock hard abs , and a rhinoplasty . 
Ugh , see ? Wow , Slay , 
Courage , Brave , Bravocity . 
Those are their names ? 
Well , I slayed Gramore 's entire army with the sword of wisdom while Maverick was cowering in the command center . 
Stay victorious . Stay victorious . I never imagined myself playing a superhero . Stay victorious . This character , a down-on-her-luck historian , ends up reading the Constitution backwards . 
Now I guess she can shoot lasers out of her eyes . 
She 's supposedly bisexual , which is addressed by a little rainbow flag pin on her jacket , digitally deleted in select foreign markets . 
The movies are a billion-dollar industry , but I 'm not in the movies . 
I play her in the theme park . 
Welcome to the Superhuman Universe , presented by Zappos . 
Stay victorious . 
Hey , Madam Victory . Must have hurt when Gramore struck you with the axe . 
Not as much as it hurt him when I destroyed his entire army . 
I went to Juilliard . Uh , can we ... I had to move back to Florida because my mother got sick . 
I kept thinking I should write and make opportunities for myself as an actor , but this job was so uninspiring . 
I was so tired of dealing with Madame Victory 's fans , who you would think were mostly kids , but were , in fact , grown-ups with jobs and driver 's licenses and back-of-knee sweat and prescriptions . 
It was all so tedious ... until I met Carl . Hi . Afternoon , Madame Victory . How 's your day going ? 
Well , I slayed Gramore 's entire army with the sword of wisdom while Maverick was cowering in the command center . 
That 's so awesome . 
I just wanted to say thanks for all that you do . 
Carl is bisexual , like Madame Victory . 
He 's hung up on this idea that Madame Victory represents him , that her existing makes his existence easier , that the films , the merch , the park , the brand ... that it 's all a form of social progress , of activism . He sparked something in me , something that made me want to write again . 
I wear as part of , you know , the medallion holders ' perks . 
His passion is overwhelming . 
I couldn 't get enough . 
When the park is actually closed , but those are some of the times when I want to come to the park the most , actually . And I wish that I could come to the park on Thanksgiving , a lot . 
Um , but yeah , I just didn 't feel like I belonged before . And now I do , thanks to you . 
Stay victorious . 
Carl is a manager at a Best Buy nearby but spends all of his free time at the park . 
I got his full name from his credit card ... 
Scrambled eggs and hash browns , please . 
While I was serving him at my second job . Hi . 
He did not recognize me . He could only see Madame Victory , and I could only see him . Hey , YouTube . Welcome to Carl 's Collectible Corner with me , Carl . 
Have we got a figurine for you . This is the ... He 's worked as a manager at Best Buy for seven years , but keeps applying to be a manager at the Superhuman Flagship Superstore inside the park . 
Working for the Superhuman Flagship Superstore has been a dream of mine for quite some time , but once again , I heard back that they are unfortunately not taking team members at the managerial level . 
An important part of the application is a little essay portion where applicants are supposed to tell their unique story to , well , sell themselves . 
My story wasn 't unique or impactful enough , and that 's OK . 
I 'm staying victorious . 
Now , my thoughts about the incredible Dr. Danger Easter ... ah , fuck . 
So how are you doing , mortal ? 
Me ? 
Oh , staying victorious . That 's good . 
Life 's challenges can be very draining . 
Yeah . 
I wish I was like you . 
Hey , what did it feel like when it seemed like you weren 't going to be able to defeat Gramore ? 
I was really fucking sad . 
I stayed victorious . 
You were so clever . 
When you realized Gramore had the victory bell inside of his meteor , which was equipped with an anti-power shield , you relinquished your power so that you could infiltrate as a regular human . That was so smart . 
Yeah , right . 
When life knocks you down , it 's time to get smart , even if that means surrendering something you think you needed . 
So taking a page from Madame Victory , I will not be giving up . 
Instead , like her , I will relinquish my power as a manager and be applying for an entry-level stockroom position . 
It was a significant pay cut from salary back to hourly . And what 's worse , Carl did not excel in the stockroom . 
His hours were cut gradually , and after months , he was let go . 
I want to thank you for following me along on my journey . You all have been so helpful . He was told that his story was simply not unique enough . 
Carl , wait . 
I obviously disagreed . A movie ? Or a play or a short . 
I thought we could just brainstorm and see where the writing takes us . 
I think you have a really compelling story , Carl , and I mean it . 
So you would play me in this ? 
No , I don 't think so . I think I 'd play myself or a version of myself . 
It 's really hard here as an actor in Florida . You have to create your own opportunities . You can 't just sit around waiting for an audition . 
And I know that you really like storytelling , so I thought , why not try ? 
I can 't act . Oh , that 's OK . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . Let 's just focus on the writing . 
Maybe I ... or the character that 's like me ... could be unique . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah , he is . So elaborate on that . 
Or maybe your character , she 's special , but she doesn 't know it yet . OK . 
Yeah , she thinks she just , like , works at a theme park , but part-time , she 's an archaeologist , and she goes on a dig , and she finds the Constitution , and then she reads it backwards , which gives her powers . 
Like ... like Madame Victory ? 
Well , like , yeah . 
Maybe there are no superheroes . 
Like , it 's real people . Yeah , it 's real people until one day ... No , no . Sorry to interrupt , but no . 
What if there are no superpowers at all ? 
Well , then Superhuman Studios won 't like it . 
Yeah , well , we 're not making this for them . What do you mean ? 
This is not for that company . 
I don 't understand . 
Think of the core reason why you like those stories . - They inspire me . - Great . What do they inspire you to do ? 
They inspire me to watch the movies . 
OK , what do the movies inspire in you ? 
They inspire me to get inspired . 
This is really good . If we can wow them , we could become high power executives and shape the Superhuman universe . No , Carl . No . Look at me . 
Put that out of your mind . Ignore them . 
OK ? There 's a whole other world of stories . 
Stories like mine ? Yes , yes . 
That you want for yourself because you think you have no story ? 
I know you think you 're just a waitress in Florida and that your story is not unique , but you are special , OK ? 
And if you work hard enough and you try and you persevere , you , too , can work for the Superhuman Studios . 
Stay victorious . 
So yeah , they want you for " Super Chico , " 
" the first queer , 5 '8 " Latinx superhero on a straight-to-streaming series . Hell ! Hell on Earth . 
Julio , your new social media consultant is here . 
She 's helped many people get exceptions by making them famous on social media . 
Hi . SIR I 'M STILL SPEAKING ! Please pick me up ! 
No Pornography ! Oh , God . 
Circle back with more Tips ' n Tricks ! Uh-huh . So can we talk about the kind of content that we 'd actually post ? 
I booked you an exercise class so you can get fit for the superhero role . 
Also , your food delivery has not arrived . 
Excuse me , sir . Do you know ... Oh , my ... girl , not my car driving . 
Julio . Damn , I didn 't even know you was in here . My bad . I got sleepy . 
And when I get sleepy , I go to bed . 
Uh , hi . Uh , my food didn 't come , and I had to leave . 
Can we reschedule ? No worries if not . 
Ugh . What is going on ? What ? 
You picked it up so long ago . 
Edwin , where is the food ? The customer is furious . 
No worries if not . 
Excuse me . What ? 
What is this ? 
A bus stop . 
And then I was tagged in a photo of me with a tummy roll , and I know he saw it , so then it had to end , and now I have to start from scratch . And it 's like , I 'm too old to try the acting thing again . 
And I 'm literally peeling off a layer of my skin right now , hoping that I can see someone new underneath . And it 's like , I 'm trying desperately to find out what my Venus is , but there 's a paywall . And I don 't have an account . And I hate accounts . And it 's just , like , cut . 
I sound so stupid , but it 's like , you know , the whole world sees me as this mean , crazy , vapid bitch that just makes everything worse . And I just feel like I 'm ... a scared person with real problems who just wants love . 
Who am I ? 
So , like , which is it , you know ? 
God , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . 
You had a question . - Uh , yes . - Yeah . - Thank you . 
- Yeah . Um , what is proof of existence ? What ? 
What is proof of existence ? 
It 's ... it 's your thingy . 
It 's your ... it 's your thingy . 
How ... how do I get one ? 
What do you mean ? 
They just give it to you . 
You just go to the app , and then you put in your social and your credit score and ... I don 't have that . 
Don 't have what ? 
Any of that . 
Well , can you use your parents ? 
You know , I had to use my parents ' address after Charles dumped me . 
What do my parents have to do with it ? 
Oh , well , do you have your own Charles ? 
Sorry , I 'm just ... 
I do know that they do this thing for people that are , like , from abroad . They make an exception , but like , you need to be , like , a thing . 
So what do you do ? 
Delivery . 
Hmm . OK . Well , do you have any skills ? Like , skills ? 
When I was in Mexico , I was ... what is the name ? Like , I made clothes . 
Oh , like a tailor or a designer ? - Yeah . - That 's huge . 
What kind of stuff did you make ? 
I made the dress . 
No , you mean to say , I made a dress . 
No . I can show you . 
See ? 
You made that ? 
Yeah . 
You made the dress ? 
Well , it 's a really bad picture . 
What color is the dress ? 
Is it black and blue , or is it white and gold ? I mean , which is it ? 
I don 't like that question . 
It 's like , just let the dress be . It 's ... OK . Well , which color is the dress ? 
It 's both . 
It 's both . 
It 's both . 
It 's both . 
Today is the day . 
To be honest , Dodo 's coming off as a little bit unlikable . And it 's not looking good . Not looking good . I 'm sad . 
Oh , fuck . Pirulinpinpina . 
She made me a TikTok . 
That was fast . 
I feel like I need me a Pirulinpinpina . 
Well , she 's not cheap . 
All these basic little influencers have the same house ... the TikTok house . 
Seems to me like an ocean of beige ... beige walls , beige people , beige carpeted floors as far as the eye can see . 
The TikTok house is actually 80 % kitchen island . 
In fact , some say architects start by finding a kitchen island in the wild and simply building around it . 
Potato chips , Wendy 's , whey ... they all thrive on the kitchen island . 
If you 're lucky , you 'll even get to see a kitchen archipelago . And that right there is where they keep the cardboard ... the cardboard that brought the whey . 
This is the sectional . It snakes through the entire home and goes out the door , some say to infinity . 
Just don 't look behind the couch . That 's where the cords live ... cords that will never be untangled . 
A countdown clock to Thanksgiving , a refrigerator with Netflix , a toilet with Facebook , a child with Amazon in his eyes . 
All right ! 
Buddy , are you ready to drop the phone and get jumping ? We were just doing intros . My name is Derrrick ... three Rs. I 've been a coach here at Jumpers for two years . 
Any first-time jumpers ? 
Julio , this is your first time . Tell us something about yourself . 
I 'm Julio . 
Nice , man . 
Nice . All right , let 's get jumping . 
Whoo ! Yeah . Flick those wrists . Here we go . Here we go . 
Hey , get those knees up . Here we go . We 're gonna burn so many cals today . 
Y 'all looking like fire . Excuse me . Um , Derrrick ? Um , I can 't jump rope . Well , let 's teach you , then , right ? Let 's start with a basic jump first . Relax your wrists . Yeah , you got it . 
Excuse me , Derrrick . I don 't got this . 
Well , relax your wrists , then . - Uh , I 'm already relaxed ... - Well ... - Is the thing . 
- It 's all good . Flick your wrist . Just do a little flick . 
This is awful , awful , awful , horrible . 
Why do I have to jump rope at all ? Because this is a jump rope class . 
Right , but why is it a jump rope class at all ? 
It 's a great workout . 
No , I understand why jumping is a great workout . Right ? 
But I can just jump without the rope , right ? 
Well , no , I mean , you need the rope . 
Why can 't we just jump up and down with no rope ? 
I 'm asking a legitimate question . 
Like , if we were to hypothetically jump in place , wouldn 't we be burning exactly the same amount of calories and getting the exact same workout ? 
If it 's about the wrists , I 'll just flick my wrists . 
Well , no , I mean , you need the rope . 
Why ? 
OK , so children jump rope because it 's a game to them . Exactly . 
We 're having fun today , right , y 'all ? 
Like , you 're kind of struggling with it . - Just ... just drop the rope . - I agree . - I don 't need the rope . - Tara ? 
You don 't ... just drop the rope . You don 't need the rope . 
Tara , jump . Jump with the rope , with the rope . Jump rope , jump rope . - Just drop the ... - Tara , Tara . - Don 't . - Come on , Tara . 
- Jump . - You don 't need the rope . She doesn 't need the rope . And I don 't need the rope . And you know it , and you 're just too scared to admit it . 
Listen , man , it 's just , like , not how it is . 
You 're going against something that 's been happening for , like , centuries . 
Why are you so obsessed with it ? 
Because if you keep pulling at this thread , everything collapses , and suddenly , there 's no God . 
Did you take the photograph , Richard ? Snap the pic ? 
Yeah . 
Excellent , Richard . Well done . 
Now the caption : 
" Looking for twinks to suck . " 
OK . 
And suck them , I will ... of their life , their youth . 
Everything is going according to plan , Richard , with the help of this mighty tool , this Grindr oracle . 
You will lure in young prey for me . Once they are here expecting to be sucked by you , they will be sucked by me of their beauty , their energy . 
One by one , they will fall . And once I am sufficiently fed , I will once more walk the Earth as a three-dimensional Pomeranian , imprisoned by this hex no more . Yeah . 
Richard , don 't interrupt . 
How many naive , young little things are on their way to be sucked , not by you , but by me , of their beauty and their energy ? 
Um , none so far . 
Richard , you feckless imbecile ! 
You purchased this cursed portrait , so this burden is yours . 
Send more heys quickly , at once . 
Deploy your charms , Richard . Bring me youths ! 
Someone 's typing . Excellent ! 
Oh , at long last , I will be free . 
The prophecy will be complete . It says , " Sorry , man . You 're cute , but I 'm not into it . " Do you think it 's the picture ? No , can 't be . 
This is your best shirt . 
So he 's not coming , though ? 
He will not be sucked by me ? 
No . Sorry . 
Perhaps it won 't be today . Perhaps it won 't be tomorrow . But one day , I will be free . 
You know , type that . Tell him that . 
Type as I say . 
Perhaps it won 't be today or tomorrow ... 
No , perhaps it won 't be tomorrow . 
There 's beauty in the parallel there , Richard . God . Fuck 's sake . 
Perhaps it won 't be tomorrow ... Yes . 
But one day , I will ... 
Be free . Come on . Type it . What are you waiting for ? 
Bibo , there 's two ends of the necklace ... a left and a right . No , take your left and put it into the loop . 
Into the loop . The middle loop . The only loop . 
Bibo , look at the necklace . The end of the left into the loop . No , the end of the left into the loop . 
No , no . Bibo , calm down . Jesus . You know , let 's ... OK , let 's ... let 's maybe take a break from this project . It 's OK . I 'm sorry my programming has failed you , Julio . That 's OK , Bibo . 
Oh . Am I still getting paid today ? Yes , Bibo . 
Yay ! 
Payday ! 
Um , is that all you wanted to ask ? 
Also , Bibo wishes to be an actor . 
OK . 
So obviously , Bibo will need a raise . A r ... you want a raise to be an actor ? No , so Bibo can take acting lessons to do stuff like this . 
Mama , Mama , do not get on the train . Please , Mama . 
OK . Yeah . I think ... I think lessons would be good . 
And headshots and a trainer . 
Ooh , and a Soho House membership to mingle with industry insiders . 
Also , I 'm going to need time off work . 
So you want a raise and time away from work so you can pursue acting within work hours ? 
And a promotion . 
A promotion to what ? To head Bibo , or no , Bibo manager . 
Great . From here on , you are head Bibo . Wait , no . Associate Bibo manager and a raise . 
Fire alarm . No . Incoming call . 
Thank you , Bibo . 
I knew it . 
Aloha . 
Zappos called about the superhero thingy . They wanna meet with you . 
OK , great . Great , great , great . ' Cause I 've been getting in shape by jumping a lot . 
In shape for what ? 
Well , to play the superhero . 
Oh . Juli ... they don 't want you for the part . 
No , they ... they want you to cowrite it . OK . 
Otherwise , it looks bad if only some Kevins and a couple of Brians are credited on " Super Chico . " 
Cowriting is not gonna get me an exception . How about this idea ? How about Super Chico discovers that what people actually need isn 't rescuing from some alien that wants to destroy planet Earth , but what people actually need is for these corporations that come up with these inspiring stories to pay their fair share in taxes so that people can have stuff like , I don 't know , health insurance ? 
No . 
Sorry , baby , but you can 't get an exception to proof with ideas like that . 
Also , no luck getting you the biopsy . 
I talked to every shady doctor in the biz , and they all say they simply can 't do it because it 's a birthmark , and they don 't want to get sued . 
There 's always the credit card commercial . 
I 'll take it . 
Vanesja ? Miss Vanesja ? 
Your bill . 
Just charge it to the account . What is the issue ? 
There is no account . 
Vanesja . 
Ah , yes . Just one drop , and he 'll be gone for good . 
Oh , hello . Hi . I 'm just fixing you a drink . 
You should ... which one was it ? Which one ? Yes , here . 
I bet you 'll find it quite exquisite .
