Oh , my God , what ? 
I just looked at your schedule , and it doesn 't appear you 're busy right now . 
I 'm nervous about an audition . Will you help me run lines ? 
Okay . 
Dustin wants to create change . 
- Make a difference . - Right . Because in America , it 's pretty fucked up and just unfair that there 's not enough pie for everyone to have a piece at the table . 
And you 've set up a whole press conference to announce this ? 
Huge press conference . 
Well , hey , I can 't wait . 
Julio , she 's here . Wait ... sorry , I got to go . 
I think I have a lead on the oyster . 
Isn 't it at the bottom of the sea ? 
Well , yeah , it is , but I think I found someone who knows the sea . 
What about Zappos and getting your exception ? Oh , she 's here , she 's here . Got to go . 
Hi . Hello . Hi . 
I 'm sorry I didn 't greet you at the ... I 'm sorry . I 'm Julio . 
Hi , Deedra . It 's so nice to meet you . - Thank you for taking this case . 
- Yes , okay . Bryce ! Where the fuck is he ? Sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry . 
I got your water . 
- My what ? - Your water . 
- You wanted a water . 
- I was being sarcastic , Bryce . 
You don 't find my joke funny ? - I do . 
I do . - It doesn 't seem like you do . 
- Whatever . All right , Julio . - Yes . So you lost an earring at the bottom of the sea ? I did , yes . - It was , like , about an inch . 
- Can I see the picture ? 
I should have emailed you yesterday about it . 
- And you got the email ? - Oh , yes , yes . 
Here . 
Okay , let 's see here . 
Since when do fish have jobs ? 
The mayor said that if people were expected to keep the waters clean , fish and other water folk should pull their weight with labor . 
All right , Bryce . - Bryce ! 
- I 'm here . I 'm here , I 'm here . 
Earring 's about an inch , gold . 
- You getting this down ? 
I have it , yeah . 
- Shaped like an oyster . - Yep . - With diamonds . 
- Yep . - Do you have an extra pen ? - Bryce ! 
Sorry . Yeah , how many , roughly ? 
- Is that relevant ? 
- How would that not be relevant ? 
I don 't know . 
I 'm sorry . Okay . Diamonds , multiple . 
And a pearl . 
Yep , a pearl . I 'll keep it up here . All right , we 'll let you know when we find it . 
Bryce , let 's go . 
Deedra won 't let you down . 
And I was just wondering , for later , what would you like for lunch ? Oh , I don 't know . Fish maybe . 
- Julio . - Yeah . They already shut down the warm water . 
Also , what are you doing looking for that oyster ? 
The good people at Zappos will get you an exception . 
But that could take months . 
Bibo can 't with this right now . Bibo has a big audition today . 
The next L train will arrive in 178 minutes . 
What are you gonna do today , sweetie ? 
I don 't know . 
Apply for jobs maybe ? 
I cannot believe that superhuman whatever wouldn 't give you your job back at the mall . 
What you need is God . 
Come to church with me . 
I don 't believe in that stuff . Sorry . 
I 'm not really into anything right now . 
Why don 't you go to Central Park ? It 's nice . 
It 's no Florida , but New York ain 't so bad . 
When I build a sandcastle , I expect that next year it will be there . 
Isn 't it fun ? 
Want to know what 's chilling ? This is me already in therapy . 
I 'm by far the youngest , and I don 't have to prove it . 
Oh , honey , you 're not that young . 
Face it , hating me is easier than hating yourself . 
Why don 't you say that to my face ? 
So I arrive at Bianca 's restaurant opening ... 
- Dina ! - Hi , Bianca . 
Fashionably late . And I am completely disturbed by what I see . 
Wait , Bianca , to your question , what does Genevieve plan on doing about that corner ? 
What corner ? 
That corner over there . It 's negative space . What 's the thought there ? 
People are expected to eat here . They 're gonna be disturbed by the hole . 
Can I help you , Dina ? 
Oh , there 's no need to get all worked up . I 'm just asking a question . 
I designed Bianca 's restaurant . 
And I think I know what I 'm doing . I went to SCAD . 
Online . 
Bombshell . 
The degree was online , but the computer was big . 
Girls , girls , girls , please . It 's the big night . Come on . 
So , to get our minds off all the drama in the city , I decided to take the girls to the Sandcastle Villas and Golf Club in the Bahamas for a little girls ' trip . 
Hopefully all drama involving the void stays in New York . 
I packed my bikini , my sun hat , and all the drama involving the void . 
Isn 't it fun ? 
- Love . - It 's fabulous . 
And look , Genevieve , all the corners are filled . 
Well , looks like all that void drama didn 't stay in New York . 
I didn 't talk about it . I wasn 't talking . You 're literally speaking right now . 
I 'm not saying a word , sweetie . I think this is in your head . 
Don 't talk to me when you talk to me . 
Donnie , bring them more champagne . 
They 're already pretty drunk , sir . 
Oh , my God , are they ? 
Did I fucking ask ? 
Good boy . 
There 's no need to get worked up . 
I 'm not getting worked up . You 're just stirring all this drama . 
Well , Genevieve , I have been thinking , and it 's really [ bleep ] up that I took a chance on you , and you ruined my big opening by negative space . 
Everyone was disturbed by the void . 
What is going on here ? 
Let 's all wrap for the night . 
You know , she 's crazy . 
And I finally design this beautiful restaurant for her ... 
Girls ' room . I fucking never said that . My credit card doesn 't have a limit . 
Don 't say anything . What is this ? 
Who am I ? 
Everything 's gonna be okay , but you have to stay calm . 
Power down . 
I 'll stay back and close up . 
Now , look , Genevieve . - What ? - It 's okay , okay ? 
They can 't see us . 
The cameras are off . But you need to stay calm , all right ? Don 't yell . 
Gen , it 's me , the real Bianca , okay ? Just breathe , all right ? Just breathe . Genevieve , I just need you to watch this . 
Oh , God . If you 're seeing this , I 'm so sorry . 
I tried my best , but I failed . And the fact that you 're seeing this means you 're no longer under their control , his control . Who ? How ? 
Jared , the producer . 
You 've been trapped in his sick little play . 
What you believe is your life has all been a simulation . 
But now at least the two of you are awake . I can save you . We can escape . 
You seem so familiar to me . 
What is your name ? 
Brandon . 
Ladies , tomorrow is the day , all right ? I 'm gonna have control of this door . I 'm gonna change the code , and I 'm gonna leave it unlocked . 
All you have to do is just make it through one more day , okay ? 
And whatever you do , do not go into Jared 's office . 
I 'm so happy I booked this Benihana-level experience to get away from all that drama back in the city . 
My stomach 's really upset . 
I told you , Rellany , I can 't do " tort-ill-ee-ahs . " 
Where 's Brandon ? 
Upstairs with the boss . 
I wonder what he did . 
- Genevieve , you 're on fire ! 
Your hand . 
- We should get some water . 
- I don 't have water . 
Someone 's had one too many , clearly . 
Power down . 
Wait . 
It 's unlocked . Let 's go ! 
I have to try . 
Honey , we did try . Let 's go . Gen ! 
No . No , not without Brandon . 
- He helped us . - Gen ! 
I 'm not leaving without him . 
Brandon ? 
Where 's Brandon ? Where 's Brandon ? 
God , you 're so stupid . 
Yes and no . 
It 's me , Genevieve . Your creator . 
Your God . 
- Gen. - What ? 
What is this ? 
Hi , Bianca . 
You look pretty . What ? What is going on ? 
Why do you seem so familiar ? 
I know , right ? 
Probably because you all have a little bit of the source in you . 
The source ? 
Yes . The source . 
The original True Rich Woman of New York . 
Beautiful . Vicious . My mom . 
The human brain is such an incredible thing . 
You can mine whole worlds , even after the body is gone . 
I mined her brain for your behavioral patterns . 
You see , it 's so easy to find a mean rich lady . But to make a mommy , a mother , I had to go straight to the source . 
- Your mind is intertwined with hers . 
- It 's Little Chicken Legs . 
Don 't call me that , Mommy , okay ? 
Because they 're genetic , and you know that , and you know I got them from Dad . And it is not my fault that you two fucking hate each other ! 
Your mother used to pretend to be sick on your birthday so she would take the spotlight . 
She pretended to be gay when you came out . 
Enough ! 
Enough , okay ? 
None of that matters anymore , because now I get to play with her , through you , forever . 
Let us go . Go ? 
Is that what you want ? Yes . 
I mean , okay . - The door is over there . 
- Oh , thank God . 
Jesus . 
Have fun in prison . 
Or did you forget ? 
You 're here because you signed a contract . Remember ? 
Better this than going to jail for tax fraud , right ? 
Ladies , don 't be afraid . Uncle Sam and I , we 've reached an understanding . 
After all , you are our greatest export ... an aspirational way of life . 
Why set us free , then ? 
Why are you getting this ? 
Sometimes it 's good to , like , rattle the cages . 
Your attempts at freedom were the perfect season finale ! 
Anyway , what are we thinking ? 
A couple more seasons ? 
I don 't think they have bodycon dresses in prison . 
Coming up next on " The True Women of New York " ... 
Last night I was thinking about my childhood , and I couldn 't remember any of it . 
I couldn 't remember my parents . 
There she goes again . 
I just think it 's distasteful to not do a root touch-up before a night out . 
This is called a style . 
I 'm sorry . 
So then they purposely unhypnotized him . 
I mean , it was like a circus . I loved it . 
So , tell us , how does it feel to finally see yourself represented ? And do me a favor . Just throw in something in , you know , Spanish . 
It feels incredible to finally get a script where I feel myself represented . 
When I got it , I was like , ay dios mio ! 
Julio Cutio , will you show her how we actually , you know , envision the line ? 
Abuela , I wasn 't hiding in the cupboard . 
No , they need it to be a little more like Pixar acting . 
So like , Abuela , I wasn 't hiding in the cupboard . I was just looking for salt ? 
Is it true your tamales are made with magic ? 
Exquisite . 
I think she 's it . 
AdiÃ  3s . 
Please , let 's not do this show . 
I have a bunch of other scripts . 
Do you remember that dolphin that got stuck in the Gowanus Canal in South Brooklyn ? 
It would be a really , really , really great movie , maybe like a three-hour . 
The dolphin , no one knows how it got there ... 
Okay , I 'm sorry . Just stop it . Stop it , really . 
It 's just , a time comes when you got to grow up and just move product , sweetie . That was incredible . So transformative . 
I saw you through the glass . 
What 's your process like ? 
I study people , and I contour . 
Oh , that 's amazing . 
I love talking to actors . Like , picking their brain . 
Yeah , so , obviously , you got the part . 
Yes , correct . Thank you . 
Yeah , so I 'm just gonna need to see your SAG card and Proof of Existence . 
I don 't have those things . What ? 
I 'm a robot . 
I tried applying , but the forms have no box for Bibo . 
So you say you want my ideas , but then you want them to fit into your boxes , so really , there 's no room for anything new . 
Bibo ? 
What 's going on ? 
An unproduced Zappos script ? 
" Rejected . " " Discarded . " " Not an interesting story . " 
The letter Q ? " Lion King " from the point of view of a zebra ? 
Taxi . 
What ? 
Yes , I 'm Carl , calling from Carl 's phone . 
I found a script by a Julio . 
I 'm listening . 
I really see myself in these stories , and I think other people like me would agree . 
Maybe we can think of something . 
This is absolutely ridiculous . 
He auditioned for the part . He got the part . You liked what he did . Just give him the part . Look , I have an idea , though . 
We can 't hire him as an actor , but there 's no reason we can 't hire him as prop . 
That 's very insulting . Bibo 's not gonna do that . - Deal ! 
- Bibo . This is insane . I do this without Proof . Why can 't Bibo ? 
Well , you have a Proof case pending . 
Well , surely we can find an exception maybe . 
Bibo does not want to be an exception . 
Bibo wants to be an actor . 
Incoming call . 
One sec . Yeah , hi . Hello . - Hold , please . - Wait , no . This is Julio . Is this about my lab results ? 
- I said hold , please . 
- Wait , you 're putting me on hold ? You 're the one who called ... - Oh , my God . - I fucking hate them . Did you hear that Nautica was " sick " today ? 
- That bitch is not sick . 
- Yeah , I think she just has crabs . Yeah . 
What 's that smell ? 
I think it 's an oil spill . 
Not me dying from an oil spill like my parents . 
I 'm so sorry about that . You didn 't deserve that . 
Justice did not smile at us today . But I 'd like to think we took a small step in shedding light on the injustices at my ... 
Girl , what a goddamn bummer . 
You know , I got that Dodo was fucking rancid , but come on . Well , at least the elves are getting a Christmas bonus . 
I mean , they didn 't get that before , so that 's something , I guess . 
Very glass half full . You give optimism , honey . - I love that . - Right . My bad . Hey , baby . Welcome to Chester 's . - We doing deliveries today ? - Yes , thank you . 
- Okay . Come on . 
- Chester . - What ? - In the app , there is no price . 
- How much is it ? - No , no , no , baby . This is my company , and I decide what 's what . 
And today for you , I can do a little sliding scale . 
Okay . Bueno . 
Give me some nachos . I 'm hungry , honey . Can I get a nacho , too ? 
We got another one , y 'all . Hi . Sorry . For Carl . I 'm Carl . Yeah , Carl , I know . That 's why I 'm here . 
Chester , I 'm two hours late . 
Look at them all ... so small and pathetic . 
Dustin , baby . I have to make a confession . 
This big press conference , I ... I don 't know what it 's about . 
It 's okay . 
I got the big idea . I 've been thinking about it all morning . 
Yeah . 
You know I play a homeless gay teen on " Cunty Little Rich Kids School of Magic " ? 
Yes , of course . 
It just feels wrong . 
I 'm just getting super rich by exploiting the plight of people less fortunate than me . 
Baby , who taught you " plight " ? 
And everyone celebrates me . 
But fuck that ! 
' Cause I get fucking paid . 
And the network , the network , the fucking network makes money off it . 
And Big Oil bought the network . And then people watching the show , they 're like , wow , we 're seeing progress . 
But what they don 't even realize is , just by watching it , they 're widening the wealth gap by actively enriching the very people oppressing those they claim to represent . 
I thought you knew . 
So here 's my pitch . 
What if we all stop doing the show until the people at the top ... promise to redistribute what they earn ? 
We can line up , link arms , do a real " boy-cutt . " 
- A what ? 
- I can get the whole cast in on it . Maybe we can even get the entire industry to be paid equally . 
Dustin , baby , I 'm so proud of you . 
Let 's make it public . 
I found the oyster . 
- Oh , God . - Yeah . I 'm on my way to get the procedure . 
Next time you see me , I 'm not gonna have a body . 
Don 't do that . Did you read the article I sent you about those places ? No . The headline said they mine your abilities to make software to replace people . Don 't do anything stupid . 
I have to go . Ciao . 
Okay , just like we rehearsed , from the heart . 
Yeah , okay , got it . 
Action ! 
What up , you busty , dusty fucknuts ? 
Boy , do I have an announcement for you ladies today . 
It 's gonna be sick . 
Let 's not say " fucks " or " nuts . " 
- Okay . I can do that . 
Oh , before we do this , can we carve out the vacation time really quick ? 
' Cause I really want to get that villa in Tuscany , and I don 't want it to get snagged . 
Well , I don 't know about a villa . What ? Why ? 
Well , with this new redistribution model , you 're not gonna have all these loads of extra cash lying around . Am I gonna be , like , fucking broke ? 
No . 
No . 
You 'll be comfortable . And you 'll go on vacation . And we will find you a house to buy . 
Won 't be a villa . 
And lots of presents . You 'll have lots and lots of presents . 
Like this . This came in the mail . 
It 's from a female fan , I think . 
Yeah , probably . 
Okay . And let 's get this press conference rolling . 
I 'm so proud . You 're giving me purpose . 
Dustin . 
Let 's call it off . 
The press conference . Fuck it . 
Why ? 
Because ... all I did today was try , and that is ... " e-noog . " 
Does it hurt ? 
You want to get that before you have no fingers ? 
Hello . 
This is not a great time . 
I 'm about to get uploaded . 
Is this Mr. Julio Torres ? 
I 'm calling from ASAP MD regarding your results . 
It all looks good . 
- Sorry , what was that ? 
- It all looks good . 
Sorry , what was that ? 
Yep , it 's benign . Have a good day . 
Hey . So this is not the missing piece . 
What do you mean ? 
Yeah , it 's not a part of the antique . 
Are you sure this is the oyster you were looking for ? 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm sure because they took my fingerprints . 
Okay , well , this is from Amazon . 
So it 's not one of a kind . It 's not unique . 
All right , let 's get this demolition started . 
Bibo , are you here ? 
Are you hungry ? 
Vanesja and I are gonna have a dinner meeting to discuss the waterfalls idea that I have . 
I think one that goes sideways . 
Bibo ? 
Bibo ? So you made " How I Came Out to My Abuela " ? - Yeah . - Really , really great show . 
I haven 't seen it . 
Oh , but it is really good that you got Proof , especially now that you need it to , like , vote and stuff . 
Yep . I just got a credit card and put my Netflix on it . Cool . You are officially the proud tenant of unit 72 . 
Home sweet casa su home . 
Make it yours . 
- Hi . - Hello , my little star . 
I have a surprise for you . I found some people who are really responding to your ideas . 
Come to the elementary school and meet your new collaborators . 
Just ahead of my time , man . Gut microbiome . 
You 're late . 
For what ? 
Look sharp . 
I got to be farther back in the alphabet . 
Whatever , weirdo . 
Ain 't that the girl who killed that guy in the bathroom ? 
K does what you do . Ouch ! You and your pathetic stick . 
Micro , wake up . Turn off your TV . 
I 've got eyes on Bibo . 
Bibo is flying in , and Bibo has landed . Do you copy ? Bibo has landed . When I say " copy , " you have to say " copy . " - Copy ? 
- Edwin ! Edwin ! It won 't stay on my little head . 
Okay . Don 't worry . Don 't worry . I got you . Babe , how do I look ? Oh , gorgeous . 
Bibo got two characters ? 
Do you think Carl prefers him ? 
- I only got to play one character . 
- No , no , no , baby . Don 't focus on Bibo . Don 't focus on anyone else , okay ? Focus on yourself . 
Okay . Yes , thank you . 
Have you eaten ? - Go grab one of my power bars . - Okay . 
Break a leg . 
How long is it ? - How long is it ? - It should be ending now . 
Any trash that you have , just throw it away . 
No recycling in the building , please . 
- Thank you . - Very beautiful . - Very , very beautiful . - Shall we ? - Yes . Let 's go . - Bye . Ciao . 
Oh , damn , I need to get my phone charger . 
- Meet you outside . 
Hey , you . You wrote those ? 
Yeah . Why ? 
Did you even ask for permission ? 
Why are you wearing that ? 
Well , that 's unacceptable . Book the flight . 
Yeah . Hello , Vanesja . 
I 'm gonna have to call you back . 
Why are you following me ? 
It was you giving the incredible performance , Vanesja . 
I 'm gonna ask one more time . Why are you following me ? 
I was the top agent in the business ... until my lazy artist sister started doing a performance of me and stole my life ! 
Bibo . 
Vanesja . 
Oh , you 're good . 
Bibo is also an artist . I have ideas , too , you know . I 'm just doing other stuff all the time . 
I 'm on the football team , and , you know , I ... Oh , no , I see . 
Here , take my doctor 's note . You 're exempt . 
Just show them that . You don 't have to do anything you don 't want to do .
