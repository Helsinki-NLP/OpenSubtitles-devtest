Hello , Crayola . 
One yellow . Yellow for the sun . Yellow for a duck . 
That 's a great choice . Everybody loves a duck . 
OK , now do orange . 
White . 
Gray ! 
Black . 
Beige . 
Thank you . Thank you . But the reason I 'm here is because I was tossing and turning all night , thinking about how you need to make a clear crayon . - Clear ? - Like the color clear . Yes . 
But clear isn 't a color . 
If it isn 't a color , what do you call this ? 
What do you call what ? 
The emotional space , I mean . 
But ... but then ... - If a crayon is a clear wax ... - Mm-hmm . And it leaves no discernible color behind , what 's the use ? It cannot be done . Wh ... why are you doing this ? 
Why do you need this ? 
It 's already done . 
Look at this glass of water over here . It 's defiantly clear . 
Some things aren 't one of the normal colors or play by the rules of the rainbow . 
Think about air or smells or ... or memory . 
Shouldn 't they be allowed to be colors ? 
To color something clear is to acknowledge that maybe things are different , and that 's just fine . 
To color something clear is to reimagine coloring as we know it . 
Thanks so much for stopping by . You 've given us a lot to think about . 
If we were to move forward with clear Crayola , what would we call it ? 
Oh , um , call it " Fantasmas . " 
" Fantasmas " ? It means " ghosts . " 
But why plural ? Why not " Fantasma " ? 
It 's " blue , " not " blues . " 
Oh , because I ... I like it . 
Right , but logically , it should be " Fantasma . " 
You know what ? 
You 're right . Let 's call it " Fantasma . " Singular . No S. - Good . - Good . 
Where is my car ? Oh , there 's my ride . 
Hi . For Julio ? 
Mm-hmm . Welcome to Chester 's . 
Just a few things . 
Close my door ... gently ... delete your Uber app , and download Chester . It 's gonna be the only app you 'll want to use from now on . 
Uh , what ... what 's the Chester app ? 
Oh , it 's basically the Chester alternative to Uber , but all the proceeds go to Chester . 
You could book a ride with me via the app and have access to a community board where users share the bathroom codes at various Chipotle locations . 
It 's giving grassroots up in here , honey . 
Oh , also , if you a legacy rider , you can get picked up and dropped off , even if I 'm already with somebody . 
Mm-mm , mm-mm , mm-mm , mm-mm . That TV must remain on at all times . And it must only play " Melf . " 
One for you and one for me . 
How do you do it ? 
Uh ... - Uh ... - Grace , be careful . 
What are you ? 
I 'm Melf from the planet Melf . 
Can we keep him ? Please ? 
Fine . 
Melf loves cookies and spaghetti ! 
Jeff ? 
I ... I heard a noise downstairs . Thought there were robbers in the house . Turns out , it was just Melf here having a late-night food fight all by himself . 
You are helping me clean this up . No excuses , Melf . 
You know what ? You go back to bed . I 'll start cleaning up . All right . Good night . Don 't stay up too late . 
We can 't let it get that close again , Melf . 
Melf loves cookies . And spaghetti . And Jeff . 
Jeff really likes Melf too . 
Melf does not want to be on the side . Melf wants to be first . 
When will Jeff tell Nancy about Melf ? 
Soon . 
I love you . 
Oh ! You scared me . What are you ... What are you , um ... Listen . 
Girl , leave his ass . What the fuck are you talking about ? 
Are you fucking kidding me ? - OK . - Get out ! Get out , Jeff ! 
- Hi , Dad . - Hi , sweetie . I , uh ... hi . 
Hi . - May I ? - Of course . 
It 's just ... Thank you for , uh ... for inviting ... 
Oh , I was just so surprised you called , Grace . It 's Toast . It 's Toast now . - Yes . - Yeah . Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . 
Your mother died and gave you her ring . 
I 'm joking . Oh , my God . My little ... - Toast . - Toast is getting married . 
I think you 'd really like her . 
Her ? 
Are you serious ? Sorry , I ... I didn 't ... Your step-Melf is gonna be so happy . Dad ... Do you have a wedding registry ? 
- Anything you want , on us . - Dad ... I don 't want Melf at the wedding . 
Oh . Oh , Jeff , you won 't believe who I saw down at the store today ! I ... 
Hey , Jeff , Melf left some groceries in the car . 
I 'll get ' em . Wait , Dad . Dad ... Are you hungry ? 
Uh , I was ... I was just , uh , leaving . 
Oh , let Melf fix you a plate . 
No , I ... I really have to go . 
Oh , how about some cookies and spaghetti ? 
Julio ? Julio ? 
There 's Bibo . 
Oh , my God , get out . That 's your assistant ? Yeah . It 's like a secretary . 
Hi , Bibo . 
Welcome to Chester 's , Bibo . 
Thank you . 
I need to take tomorrow off for a teeth cleaning . 
Um , but you don 't have teeth . 
It 's on the calendar . 
Oh , I believe it 's in the calendar , but you don 't have teeth . 
- I got a Groupon . - I know . Look , I 'm completely fine with you taking tomorrow off . I 'm completely fine with you going to the dentist . But I just don 't want you to get there and be disappointed when there 's nothing to whiten . Gaslighter . I want a raise . 
Are there any non-Bibo-related items in this bag ? 
As a matter of fact , another one of these came in . 
I detect it 's urgent . 
Julio , you 're ignoring this again . These letters are piling up . 
These are most likely from your landlord . 
What is that siren call ? 
Julio . Don 't go into yourself again . 
Wait , do you hear that ? Do you hear that ? Do you hear that ? No . What ? 
I 'm gonna get out here . OK . 
- Nice to meet you , Chester . - Likewise . Have a good day . 
You too ! 
Um , hi . Uh , what is that ? 
What is this ? What is that sound ? 
It 's a little oyster . With little diamonds . 
It 's unique , rare . Beautiful . 
I 'll take it . 
What ? Well , that mole behind your ear . 
It almost looks like the oyster 's shadow . 
Oh , it 's not ... it 's not a mole . It 's a ... it 's a birthmark . 
I 've ... I 've had it checked . 
It 's exactly the same size . How ... Odd . 
How odd . 
She said it was part of a cursed antique , so I had to buy it . Perfect . It 's perfect . One of a kind . - Thank you . 
- Oh , my God . Like his apartment . Have you seen it ? 
It 's gorgeous . 
This is going to be huge for you . 
- I lost it . - I ... 
- No ! - Yes . 
- The oyster ? - Yes , the oyster . 
No . 
Did you find it ? 
- No . - Aw . 
I want to go . Do you want to split a Chester with me ? A what ? 
Chester . 
All right . Y 'all ready ? I 'm gonna just drop Amina off first , ' cause , you know , she a teacher . But then y 'all are next . 
Oh , there 's the building I 'm applying for . 
You 're moving into the Capital One Residencies ? 
The ExxonMobil one . 
- Oh . - And Julio , they have a swimming pool . 
Ooh , girl , I hear it 's nice . 
Did they ask you for that thingy , though ? 
Proof of existence . 
Hmm . Yes . They ask it for all apartments now . 
Child , I don 't play with no damn proof of existence . 
I don 't need one . 
Girl , tell me why Uber was trying to get me to get one , and I was like , y 'all are trying to take half of my money off my rides and want me to pay for an ID that proves that I exist ? Girl , bye . I exist . 
Good . 
I don 't ... I don 't even have one , and I don 't want it . I want nothing to do with it . Wait , go off , sis . 
I look like garbage in mine . 
What do you do , Vanesja ? 
It 's pronounced " Vanesa . " 
The J is silent , like the poisonous flower . 
Oh . I 'm a very important talent agent , here on very serious business . 
She 's a performance artist performing as my agent , but she 's been doing it for so long that now she 's just doing , like , regular agent stuff . 
So it 's just kind of unclear . 
Wait , but you submitted " agent " for your proof ? 
No more questions , Chester . 
Aw , secretive girl . 
OK . What about you , Julio ? What do you do ? 
Julio was struck by lightning as a child . 
Ever since , he 's seen the world a little differently . 
Mm . When I came to , they gave me a doctor 's note to skip gym for the rest of my life . 
I got it laminated , and that 's what I show people when they ask for proof of existence . Wait , OK . Side note . What was you doing in the woods ? 
I don 't remember . I don 't think ... you know . He was pooping . 
I don 't think it matters . 
In fact , he was wiping when the lightning hit . 
But he takes that part out of the mythology , due to societal shame . 
Wait , but what do you do ? 
Like , I am a teacher . You are a ... A Julio . 
It 's what he does . 
Mm-mm . Elaborate , please . 
I mean , you know , I wake up , and I just sort of Julio . 
It 's amazing . Just today , he was consulting for Crayola , and tomorrow , he 's meeting with NASA to rebrand a constellation . 
I can feel the inner lives of , uh , shapes and colors and sounds and numbers and letters . I started doing letters recently . 
Like , OK , let me give you an example . 
You know how the letter Q comes up way too early in the alphabet ? 
How do you mean ? 
Well , it should be all the way in the back with the fellow avant-garde letters : the X , the Y , and the Z. Q didn 't ask to go early . I mean , just imagine what it would feel like . 
Delightful . So nice and easy . Once again , give it up for P. 
And now , put your hands together for Q. 
All the letters in the alphabet have been so accessible , until Q takes the stage . 
Hey , I 'm Q. 
â  ª You 're all gonna die â  ª â  ª I don 't know why â  ª Shit-fuckers . 
- Thank you . - Thank you , Max ! 
This next one is called , " Your Zipper is Open , and Your Cock is Hanging Out . " 
No one gets him . Q just went up too early . Come on ... you got me sandwiched in between these two normies . 
I 'm sorry , but that 's what they are . 
Who the hell you got up there now ? R ? 
Listen to him . They 're eating him up . 
I 'm not accessible like that . 
That 's why you gotta put me on late , you know , when they 're all liquored up . We talked about this . 
I don 't make the order . 
Fine . You know what ? This club sucks , and so do you . You know what ? I 'm proud to be niche . I don 't care . 
I 'm only kidding , man . Come on . You know me . Just ... just give me a chance . 
But Q will continue to be Q. 
â  ª Social Security â  ª â  ª Oh , you 're so maturity â  ª â  ª Your 401 is not OK â  ª - Have a nice day . - This is great . - Hey ! - What is this ? - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - Hey , come on ! 
Nice to meet you . I 'm O. Listen , you know what the difference is between you and me ? What ? 
The little stick . 
You got to lose that thing . 
Yeah , but then I 'd be ... Me . 
My understudy . 
I got so many gigs right now . Orange , orangutan , ooze . I 'm in that one twice . 
Listen , I 'm swamped . I need an extra pair of hands . Give me a call when you 're done being an out-of-work letter , huh ? 
- Whoa ! Ooh , I can do it too . 
No one is buying what Q is selling . There 's no market for weird . 
And for years , Q had to find other ways to pay the bills ... while all the mainstream letters were swimming in opportunity . 
Becoming the highest-grossing consonant in the alphabet . 
F is set to sign a multimillion-dollar contract to start a new word alongside America 's sweetheart , B. 
Peeved at coming ... And then the worst happened . Weird suddenly became cool . 
Yeah , man , we 're W , X , Y , and Z , and we don 't play by the dumb rules of this town , and we won 't play nice . 
And Q just missed the boat . 
We 're not like anything you 've seen before . We shatter the rules . We don 't get in line . 
As the injustice of it all slowly crept in , it finally became too much for Q. 
All those years of insisting on his art , staying true to himself . Feeling stuck , he decides to ... break free . 
Oh ! Shit ! 
Oh , OK . So do any of the more mainstream letters in the alphabet have any animosity towards you guys ? 
You could just say that the letter G has been sliding into all of our DMs . 
Hello ? Hey , O. It 's me , Q. 
I just want to address something here . I don 't think we 'd be here without the influence of Q. 
Is this a performance piece ? What are you doing ? Personally , but their work has had an impact on mine , and I can safely say for us all here . And we would have never been here , had it not been for the boundaries Q broke down . To no fame , no glory ... just to the relentless , unwavering commitment to authenticity . Q made audiences uncomfortable long before weird was cool . 
So if you 're watching this , just know that I 'm a huge fan . 
Are you there ? Can you talk ? Hello ? Hey , fuck off . 
You felt that , right ? 
Girl , you feel all that just by looking at a Q ? I told you . That 's what I do . 
Call me if you want to book him , and I 'll Vanesja right into it . Amina . Girl , we 've been here . Amina , girl . 
Sorry . Thanks . Bye . 
I can 't stop thinking about it . 
I saw it for the first time a week ago . 
It was late , and I was one of the few people left in school . 
As I hovered over the toilet bowl , I contemplated the carvings and drawings the boys had made in the stall ... all drawings of penises , typical bully stuff . 
Then I saw it , in a corner of the stall , as if hiding from its friends ... a penis with its head turned away from the viewer ? 
What could it mean ? 
Was the dick sad ? 
Was it being crushed by the expectations of masculinity ? 
Or was it just living its own life ? 
I couldn 't ignore this cry for help . 
I had to find out who drew it . 
Maybe it 's one of the gay ones ? No . The gay ones don 't draw dicks . They draw eyes . 
Mm . With huge , luscious lashes . 
Hang on . 
How 's it going , Rick ? 
In the boys ' bathroom , did you draw a penis with its head averting the viewer 's gaze ? Like this ? 
Why are you wearing a purple shirt ? 
Purple 's a girl color . You 're not supposed to wear that . 
Stop it . 
I 'm just letting him know he 's not supposed to wear that . 
Why not ? 
Bitch . 
All right , detention . 
A bunch of bullies . 
Michael ? 
Did you draw this ? Yeah . ' Cause I 'm a boy , bitch . 
Michael . Why does this penis look like this ? 
I think sometimes ... I don 't know . It 's like , I 'm a boy , and there 's things that I can 't do . 
So when I see kids doing whatever , like wearing purple , I get so mad . 
So I kick them to remind them of what 's what . 
You see me being a jerk , but I 'm a jerk just so that you 'll see me . 
In reality , no one sees me . 
And Ms. Roberts , I 'm ... I 'm trapped . 
Ew . Dang , Ms. Roberts ! You 're married . 
Bitch is so fucking horny , man . I 'm telling you . 
What 's this ? Huh ? 
What are these keys for ? 
Oh . Last night , the guys and I were wasted and found those , like , stuck in a fence . 
Wait , what ? 
They were , like , placed , like , probably for someone to find them . 
To get in somewhere ? Yeah . They 're locked out now . 
The envelope says , " Gracias , mamÃ ¡ . " 
So probably some lady who you don 't know got locked out late at night . 
Jesus , you 're mad at me now ? No . No , I 'm not mad . I 'm just , like ... I 'm just confused . Jesus , even my girlfriend fucking hates me . 
I didn 't get the promotion ! Hello ? I needed to blow off some steam with the guys . 
I had to fucking beg them to come out because I 'm not Jared . 
When Jared texts the group thread , all their fucking panties drop . 
It 's fucking crickets with me . 
So then when I finally have some fun and do a little prank , you 're here making me fucking feel bad . 
Boop , boop . Do you want to watch " True Women of New York " ? 
Are you sure ? 
Wait . 
Yeah , but you gotta make sure you get it back to me , because they have to go to the scientist . 
You know they say the answers to all our problems are hidden in our dreams . 
Julio ? Are you still rolling ? 
No , I 'm not still rolling . That 's highly inappropriate , Bibo . 
Well , grab your rubber ducky . It 's time for our shower . 
Our what ? 
Sometimes I feel like I just don 't know you . 
Um , hi . Hi . Hello . 
Um , I , uh ... I 've been having this recurring dream ... 
Uh , where , uh , I 'm in a room , uh , and I 'm wearing this tall , uh , cone-shaped hat . 
Uh , the garment is silk or maybe a cotton blend . Doesn 't ... doesn 't matter . 
But I 'm sitting in this , uh , contraption of sorts . Very ingenious , actually . It ... it allows me to , uh , read without having to turn the page . How to take a good photo where your ... Do you know how annoying it is to try and record a dream while you 're ... you 're listening to that ? 
Don 't yell at me . 
Sorry , I don 't ... don 't ... don 't mean to yell . It 's fine . 
Um , so the contraption allows me to read the entire book without ever turning the page . But then I can feel it getting a little warm , so I decide I want to open a window . 
But then I get to the window , and it leads nowhere . 
I go to the next window , and I open it . 
The same . 
And then again . And then I go to the next window , and the same . 
I try to open the door , and it also leads nowhere . 
Then I finally see a door across the room . 
That one does lead outside . 
It 's snowing now , and people are ... are walking around , all ... all uniformed in these unremarkable black puffer coats . 
It 's clear that if I go out , I would have to wear one of them in order to stay warm . 
And then I see it ... a black puffer coat with my name on it , calling to me , saying , " Come out and wear me . " 
I go back into the room , terrified , but now the room is closing in . So I try ... I try to leave , but I ... I can 't because of my big , beautiful hat . 
The only way I would be able to leave is by compromising somehow . But how ? And then I wake up . End of dream . 
Another one of these came . Another one of what , Bibo ? 
Oh , just ... just put it with the rest . 
Doesn 't look important . 
It 's from your ... dun , dun , dun ... landlord . 
You read my mail ? With my X-ray vision . Didn 't open it , so not a crime . It 's very important . 
Bibo , does this mole look bigger to you ? It kind of looks bigger to me . 
I wasn 't even worried about it , but Chester just now was like , " Oh , no , that looks really bad . You should get it checked . " 
Do you think I should have it checked ? No . I mean , I think if you 're so worried about it , you could get it checked . 
You should have seen ... you should have seen their face . They were like , oh , my God , like , jaw practically to the floor . 
It says you have to move out . 
They 're turning the building into a General Mills CafÃ © and Residencies . 
I should probably go to the doctor . 
Julio , you need a new apartment . And to get a new apartment , you need proof of existence . 
No , I can 't think of the apartment , because I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... 
I 'm sick . No , Julio , don 't go into your thoughts . 
Come back . Look at the real problem . 
I think it 's grown . It 's grown . It 's definitely grown . 
Oh . Oh , this is gonna be a whole thing .
