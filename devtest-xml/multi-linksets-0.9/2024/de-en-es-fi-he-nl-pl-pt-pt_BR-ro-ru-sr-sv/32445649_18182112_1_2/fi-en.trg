I used to do this piece where I 'd go to restaurants and pretend I got stood up . 
Ugh . I 'd get my dinner for free , and then I 'd leave . 
Sorry . Oh , I 'm so sorry . 
But that night , maybe it was the wine , maybe it was the moon , but I was so taken by the waiter . 
Hello . 
Hey , what 's up ? 
You 're clumsy . I was leaving his dorm in the morning when I noticed it for the first time . A puzzling discovery . An empty Gatorade bottle . 
Soon , I 'd learn that all young , straight men are obsessed with collecting these in their bedroom . 
Then I was at a completely different restaurant , served by a totally different waiter , yet something felt familiar . 
No matter what restaurant , what waiter , what dorm ... same symbol . 
Tell me about this piece right here . 
What do you mean ? 
This altar . The bottles . Oh , it 's whatever . 
It 's clearly not " whatever . " 
It was as if they made a pact . 
Why won 't you tell me about the bottles ? 
It 's just , like , with everything going on with midterms right now , I think I 'm gonna have to switch advisors . Definitely if I want to go abroad . 
Right . Were they meant to represent possibilities ? Potential ? 
How 's everything tasting ? 
Nice . 
Perhaps it wasn 't for me to understand . 
Perhaps their obtuseness was a way of saying , " Stay out of this , Vanesja . 
" You have your life , your career , " beautiful clothes . 
We ... we have this . " 
Oh , OK . Uh , let me get a rag for that . 
Thank you . 
Oh , OK , so ... so ... so wait . Sorry , what about that ? 
This mole thingy is not the issue . 
It 's just a vessel for the issue . And ... I lost it . Whatever . The point is , your problem is not a mole . It 's that you need proof of existence for an apartment . 
By the way , I just got to your place . Not to be vulgar , but you 're out of toilet paper . 
- Welcome . - Uh , hi . Hi . Hello , hello . - Hi , hi , hi . Hi . Uh , I 'm Julio . I 'm an Aquarius . I got struck by lightning when I was a child , and now I see the world a little differently , and I 'm allergic to the color yellow . 90 seconds remaining . 
OK . I 'm here because this ... this mole has ... has , uh , grown . 
Mm . No , it hasn 't . It 's a birthmark . No , it ... it ... it has . 
It 's grown . Yeah , I really don 't think so . 
I don 't want to get sued by an insurance company . I 'm just gonna tell him it 's fine . 
OK , you don 't ... you don 't ... you don 't think so . But ... but that ... that means that ... that it could have happened . 
Well , it does not look suspicious to me . 
Right , but you wouldn 't be able to tell if it 's suspicious or not unless you get a biopsy , right ? So ... so ... so you see what I mean ? - Like ... - I see . - Instead of wasting time ... - 30 seconds remaining . Your time , my time ... maybe we can just go ahead and order a biopsy . 
If this were actually something , you 'd be in the , like , 0.0000000000 ... 20 seconds remaining . 0000000001 % of cases . 
That 's me , is the thing . 
Have you been measuring it ? Are you sure it 's grown ? 
Yes . Because it was the exact same size as an earring that I lost at a ... at a , um ... like , a queer rave . So if I find it , I could ... I can prove to you that it 's ... that ... that I know ... I know we 're running out of time , but I can prove to you that it 's ... it 's grown . And ... and we can biopsy this and ... and treat me . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Sure . Good luck with that , patient in exam room five . 
Next ! 
Thank you for choosing us . Remember to take all your belongings . 
The little oyster must be at the club . 
Ugh , OK , so it 's not here . 
I mean , how small was it ? 
Well , OK . Think of the smallest thing you can think of . 
Smaller than that . 
Yay ! It 's Bibo ! 
What , Bibo ? I 'm busy . 
You need to find an apartment before they kick you out . 
I called Mona . She 's waiting for you . 
Bye-bye . 
Look at this beauty . 
She comes with keys to the mailbox . Washer , dryer . Um , there are family nights in the movie lounge , Kiehl 's discounts , as well as many other exclusive perks that are available for your convenience on the website . I don 't like it . - You don 't like it ? I don 't want my life to revolve around , um , uh , perks . 
Do you have anything a little bit more unique , like in a clock tower or , like , through a well ? 
This place has a really special energy . 
I think you should apply . You just have to show them proof . 
I don 't have proof ID . No ? Why ? Well , I ... I ... because I don 't ... 
That 's very cool . 
Bonjour . It 's me . 
I 'm back in the big city . I thought it 'd be a shame if I missed my favorite senator . 
Our usual spot ? Same time ? 
Ciao . 
Julio , did you get an apartment ? 
No , of course I didn 't get the apartment . Everyone 's asking for that fucking thing . 
Is your password still SoyDonnieDarko ? 
I know everything . 
So this is it ? It 's just , like , a website that I fill out ? 
I believe so . 
But they ... they 're ... I mean , they 're asking for stuff that , like ... How would I even , like ... first name , last name ? 
You know this , baby . 
Yeah . 
Don 't you think I should be focusing on finding the oyster so I can prove that the mole has grown and get a biopsy ? That 's probably what I should be doing . Ugh . 
I know I lost it at the venue . I 'm so sure I did . I just don 't know how or ... Wait . I was dancing with that little influencer . That 's it . I need to pump his little stomach . 
Julio ! I 'll go find him right now and take him to the urgent care . Ugh . 
Tell Bibo chili night is canceled . I 'm busy . 
Welcome back to " Court TV Live , " where we are about to hear testimony . Girl , I am gagging at this trial right now . 
Please tell me you know what is going on right now . 
Child , this elf Dodo is my hero . He 's suing Santa for unpaid labor . 
Mm-mm . It 's getting a little messy too . No shade . 
What was your understanding of your agreement with Mr. Claus ? Uh , I heard him ... Mr. Claus ... say ... 
Objection . Hearsay . Sustained . 
I remember ... my understanding was that we all ... the elves , the reindeer , Santa himself ... we do it for the love of Christmas . But that really wasn 't the case , was it ? 
Because you noticed Mr. Claus benefiting from your work . 
That 's right . 
So Santa doesn 't get paid , per se , but he gets deals with Coca-Cola , mall gigs , movies , touring . Not to mention , he gets milk and cookies just for being who he is . 
Dodo got Santa by the balls , if you ask me . Mm-hmm . 
I 'm Team Dodo , no shade . 
Santa got nothing on him . 
I mean , people really talking about this , though . 
Girl , tell me why my landlord came up to me talking about some , " Oh , the elves are trying to cancel Christmas . " 
What ? Girl , who says that ? 
On some da-da-da-da-da . Oh , if the elves wanted to get paid , they should just deliver the presents themselves . 
But who got the key to the sled ? Santa . Exactly . That 's why I was saying . 
I love somebody who stands up for what they believe in , and Dodo be doing that , you know what I 'm saying ? 
And not only is he doing it , but he 's doing it and doing it and doing it well . 
Hi , little consumers ! I just moved into the Bank of America Residencies , and the building is completely empty . It is just me and the bestie , bestie-turned-neighbor , Gina . - Please don 't come kill us . - Where you going ? - I get it . - Chester ! Drive ! 
Oh , my bad ! 
Girl , they saw me coming . They was gonna stop anyway . Oh , yeah , OK . Yeah , keep walking . 
Wait , what ? " There 's no emoji for , " Hey , not accusing you of anything , but I think you swallowed my oyster " ? 
Ugh , these are not the emojis I need . 
What I need is an emoji that is a garden filled with broken statues , each representing one of my exes . That 's for when someone texts me asking , " Hey , who 's at the club ? " 
An emoji that is one of the spoons from " Beauty and the Beast " finally getting turned back into a human but then realizing he 's still a servant . 
Oh , I see . 
That 's for when you get a promotion at work . 
Grapes , sir ? 
An emoji of an orange that contoured itself to look like a peach . You can use that when you text , " Hey , I 'm just getting ready . " 
An emoji of the planet Jupiter , shocked when he realizes that scientists have been referring to him as a gas giant . 
That 's for when someone accidentally texts something about you to you . 
An emoji of me sitting at the urgent care , and the nurses recognizing me and going , " Not this bitch again . " 
Uh , gender ? Gay . 
Any , uh , history of colon cancer ? Ew . 
You nasty . 
Uh , any prescriptions ? 
Skyler ? 
That 's me . 
- Room 4 . - That 's you . 
Oh . There 's an issue with this paperwork . 
Sir , like I told you , I simply cannot process this claim because there is no way of verifying that the card belongs to the patient . 
But the card belongs to the patient . Who else would the card belong to ? 
Sir , like I said , there is a discrepancy on the information you are giving me and the information that we have on file for said patient . 
Yes , but that 's because what you have on file is that he was born on 24 / 08 , which is clearly a typo . There 's no 24th month . 
Oh , by the way , if it helps , I 'm smiling warmly . 
I 'm sorry , but rules are rules . 
Assembly Plan Insurance . How can I help you today ? 
This is the 10th time I 've called . As a loyal insurance customer service rep , there 's nothing that excited me more than when a valued customer gets ... What do you mean there 's nothing you can do ? 
Agitated . That 's the power of working in insurance . 
They can kick . They can scream . Hell , they can be right , and I can know it . But I am a soldier for the company , a defender of the rules . 
Assembly Plan Insurance is the company , and I am his sword . 
I 'm sorry . There 's simply nothing I can do . 
- Nothing you can do ? However , you are a valued customer . 
I began toying with them by saying , " How can I help you today ? " 
But there are disloyal soldiers in our ranks . 
Sometimes it 's just like , why can 't we just apologize and help these people ? But , like , don 't yell at me . It 's not my fault Assembly Plan sucks . 
You don 't mean to insinuate Assembly Plan does not value our customers ? It 's a fucked-up system . 
It 's a flawless system . Designed by flawless minds and entrusted to us . 
God , I love insurance and banks and credit cards and the military , law , and order . 
I pity those who do not stand behind us . 
Well , now that I 'm manager , we 'll try and be a little more human with the customer . 
Yeah ! Manager ? Did she say manager ? 
I have been working here for seven years , and the president 's daughter gets promoted ? 
Does she even care about Assembly Plan ? About our rules , our customs , our way of life ? 
Assembly Plan wouldn 't betray me like that . 
What ? 
I 'm manager now . 
It 'll be an honor to serve you . 
This cannot be . 
They must pay . 
I 'm not a sword . I 'm a brick . A brick on the grand wall of Assembly Plan . 
They don 't care about me . If they don 't care about me , just like they don 't care about valued customers , then fine . 
Fine ! Anarchy shall reign . 
I will burn it all to the ground . 
I will scorch the earth . 
I will use the computer for personal use ! 
I will take my vacation days for a year from now and not alert my supervisor till 10 months before ! I need to feel . 
What have I done ? 
What have I done ? 
Assembly Plan needs me . 
Be reasonable , Becca . You can undo this . 
What ? Why won 't it let me ? 
Why won 't it let me ? 
Hello ? Hi . How can I help you today ? 
I booked a flight on your airline , and I think I need to cancel it . 
Uh , mind your tone . - May I have your unique ... - My tone ? 
Reference number , ma 'am ? - My what ? - Your unique reference number . - My reference ? 
- Go ahead . 
No , you go ahead . 
The number , ma 'am . 
You want my unique reference number ? Yes . How can I trust you with that ? 
Give it to me , Becca . 
- You want it ? 
- I need it . 
X. Yes . 
4 . 
Yes . 
A. As in Apple ? 
J. 3 . Yes . 
3 . Yeah . 
- 3 . - Yes . 3 . 
Yes . 9 . 
I cannot cancel it . Why ? - It cannot be canceled . 
- Why ? The rules . 
They state I can cancel within 24 hours . 
You bought it through a third-party site . 
That says I should call you . 
So we can tell you that . That 's nasty . 
Watch your tone . That 's nasty ! 
My hands are tied . You tied them . 
I cannot help you . I will not help you . 
But rest assured ... 
- Say it . 
- Say what ? What am I ? 
You are a ... valued ... customer . 
And don 't forget to rate us after this call . 
I 'm sorry , but rules are rules . However , you are a valued customer . 
Oh , I have to go . Sorry . 
Hi . Hi . How 'd it go ? 
I don 't have any diamonds in my tummy . 
That 's not the answer we were hoping for . 
The X-rays don 't show anything abnormal . His esophagus shows no lesions , which it would if he had swallowed an earring . 
- No lesions in the esophagus ? - None . 
That 's a shock to both of us . I 'm sorry . That was inappropriate . I 'm just in a bad mood . 
And now you need to let go of this . - OK . - OK . - You 're right . 
- Mm-hmm . I 'll just find the oyster and prove to you that my mole has grown . 
Hi , consumers . 
So today is Bi Visibility Day . And to celebrate all the bis around the world , I have teamed up with Clorox , the all-gender-inclusive germ killer . 
Hi , consumers . So today is Bi Visibility Day . And to celebrate all the bis around the world , I have teamed up with Clorox , the all-gender ... 
Gina ? 
Gina . What ? 
Can I borrow your charger ? What 's wrong ? 
What the fuck do you care ? 
I 've been a wreck all week . 
Charles left me . What ? 
I have to move out . 
And I don 't even know where to start , and I can 't get this fucking Tibetan Kabbalah whatever string off he gave me ! 
Wait , wait . Why do you have to move out ? 
Because he pays for everything , genius ! 
Oh , that 's so fucked up ! 
I 'm gonna ask if I can post about this . 
This is , like , cancelable stuff . 
For what ? 
Grooming . Grooming ? I 'm 32 . That 's the whole fucking problem ! 
I knew I shouldn 't have eaten all of that pasta . But he took me to Italy , and I just kept eating and eating and eating . 
And then I 'd come home and I 'd Peloton to death , and then I can 't even show off the new tits I got for him , which ... guess what . Too fake ! Natural is in ! 
So then I push them down so that they can fall naturally . And it 's like , for what ? You know , who am I ? 
Babe , you 're beautiful . And I know exactly what you 're going through . I 've been there . I 've been ... there . 
You will . 
No , like , I 've been there . 
Like , all men are trash . 
That 's not what I mean . 
What are you gonna do when all of this ends , huh ? 
What is " all of this " ? 
You think you can just live off of moving your tight little body and sticking your tongue out for forever ? 
Well , TikTok is really just like a stepping stone . 
Stepping stone to what ? 
My brand . 
Of what ? 
Lifestyle . I told you ! 
Right . 
So those perfume bottles you draw in that empty notebook you bring to Fire Island every year ? 
They 're throwing money at you right now . 
They 're paying for you to live in a nice apartment for a year . Celebrities pay you to pretend to be their friends , all because they want young people to want them . And your little consumers are young people for now . 
But , you know , you 'll age . 
And then your little consumers will age . 
And then those people will get old , and then a new crop of little sheep will just pop up , and they 'll have their own style . 
And I know you 're probably thinking , but what about my acting career ? That 's not it . My acting career . 
Sure . You know , go for it . But do it fast . You won 't be young forever . 
You 're insane . 
Come on . Thanks . 
No problem , no problem . 
Hey , um , do you think I 'll ever , like , be over ? Like , fall off ? 
Nah , boss . 
Look , I love the new TikTok . Come on . 
Thanks . Um , which one ? Yeah , this is good . Yeah , which one ? 
Oh , no , this is ... this is that new app , RealUs . 
My baby niece showed it to me . 
All her friends on it . Yo , it 's so fun ... are you on it ? No . 
Should I be ? 
I don 't know . 
Nah , you know , everybody on it is in , like , middle school . 
That 's , like , right before high school , right ? 
It 's good , though . 
Vine . 
What ? 
Ask them what happened to Vine and MySpace . 
Who 's there ? 
Skyler . It is I , that who gives and that who takes . 
Hi , algorithm . 
Skyler , my dear Skyler . What were you doing ? 
I was trying to make a profile on that new app . 
And why would you be doing that , my dear ? 
We need you on your app with those your age . They listen to you . 
OK , but how long are they going to care ? 
Are you not grateful for the gifts we 've given to you ? Are you not grateful for the gifts of the algorithm ? 
OK , I am . But , like , what if TikTok disappears ? Or ... or what if it becomes something that I 'm not ? 
You are but stardust , my dear . A drop in gray tides , your skills nontransferable . And no , none of these brands will care . 
You 're a building block in a never-ending tower . 
I 'll be honest with my followers . Hmm ? I 'll leave it all behind if I have to . 
They already left you behind . 
Hi , my little consumers . It 's me , Skyler . No . 
Ah ! We love you , Skyler . 
You have such nice ... OMG , shoot me ! He 's so hot ! 
Oh , your comments are so sweet . 
And I 'm so humbled by all the love . 
Goodbye , Skyler . 
Hi , my little consumers . 
I 've teamed up with Dark Water , this new company that sells super soft ... Sir , like we told you , we cannot biopsy without a referral . 
OK , see , that 's a ... that 's a problem , because I 've spoken to seven different doctors ... - Julio ... - And I 'm starting ... When was the last time you got laid ? 
Bibo ! Who taught you that ? 
When was the last time you came ? 
Bibo ! 
Maybe Bibo 's right . I need to let this go and live my life . 
OK . Be a person , be a human , be a happy , happy ... Are you tired of all this ? Huh . 
Why not give it up and allow yourself to be happy ? 
It 's ... 
OK . Free yourself from the burden of having a body . 
No body , no pain .
