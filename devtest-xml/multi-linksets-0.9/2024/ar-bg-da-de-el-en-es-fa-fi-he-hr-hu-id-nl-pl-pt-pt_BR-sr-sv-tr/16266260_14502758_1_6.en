She 's a highway woman . Said to be armed and extremely dangerous . 
What you gone and done to get yourself a 40-pound reward on your head ? 
- She killed him ! - I didn 't . It was him ! 
Get after her ! 
I need Jackson dead . 
Fate has thrown us together , Sofia . 
Your abilities have progressed . 
I want to learn more . I 'm ready . 
You shouldn 't bother with him . He 's dangerous . Poisonous . The Queen is a traitor . 
You are a Jacobite . 
Half of Anne 's Privy Council feels as I do . 
Isambard Tulley captured in Slough . 
Do you realize they 'll hang you unless I pull a few strings ? 
He 's only in there because of us . So I 'm gonna spring him . 
Look , we were sent to the planet for these poor souls . 
Are you really Nelly Jackson ? - Oh , Nelly ! 
- Everybody out . 
Dull earth dwelling . Confusion worst confounded . 
You 're going to die , Nelly Jackson . 
Sofia ? 
I really liked your play . Aw ! 
Bless . Now then , where 's the other one ? 
This is a tale of passion and woe with a nimble heroine , Polly Honeycombe , who , inspired by her recent survival of a brutal highway robbery , applied to the brooding , thunderous Mr. Scribble . 
Two together brave the fury of her heartless papa , ignore his expressed desire to forbid the match , and in the tradition of all great magisterial romances , throw caution , convention , common decency to the wind , and elope . 
I must confess that following the first giddy flush of love , the noble , ethereal Mr. Scribble showed himself to be rather more hirsute than expected . 
Oh . Good morning , my love . 
Do you think there might be any highwaymen in these parts ? 
Not a one . 
And your stunning heroine found her mind irrevocably drifting to a certain moment and a certain rogue with far less hair . 
However , with her characteristic charm and optimism , your heroine assured herself that adventure no doubt awaited . 
But soon came to find that elopements have some downsides , dear reader . 
Such as not a single robbery , tidy-ins without a misunderstood brigand in sight , and discovering one 's favorite dress upon a serving wench . 
My wardrobe is distinct , and this piece I would recognize anywhere as the one stolen by my highwayman . 
Oh , Mr. Scribble . My reputation . 
- Oh , we 're practically married . - But not yet . 
I 'm not feeling well . 
That was when a thought befell your heroine like a bolt of lightning . 
The highwayman who robbed me of my garments so many weeks ago , did so for love . 
- It was so obvious . 
The wench downstairs is the highwayman 's moll ! 
By gifting her my gowns , he sought to create a pale imitation of me . But Polly Honeycombe cannot be replaced . 
I had to interrogate her . For my heart now belongs irrefutably to my lovelorn highwayman . - And I shall stop at nothing but ... Alack ! 
Your heroine was swooning - in a most tragical manner when she ... - Hold on . 
You 're supposed to be writing a ransom note , not a blooming novel . 
- Just trying to ... - Can 't we just put her back ? 
What are we gonna tell Japhia ? 
That Amorous is a bleeding fool . 
I 'm afraid that in a delicious twist of irony , these villains have accidentally kidnapped exactly the right person . For I , Ms. Polly Honeycombe , am the true object of the highwayman 's affections . 
You don 't mean our Nell ? Nell Jackson . 
Short for Nelson , I presume . 
Nell 's not a man . 
She 's my sister . 
That 's why they took me . 
They must have thought you were Roxy somehow . 
A highwayman . Woman . 
Are you absolutely certain ? 
You keep quiet if you know what 's good for you . 
Hey ! Finish the note . 
George here . 
Me and a toff called " Polly Honeydrone " have been snatched by strollers . They thought she was you , Roxy . 
They 've taken us to a barn outside Uffington , where they 'll trade our safe return for Nell . 
Stand and deliver . 
- Me ? 
- Yes , you . 
Newgate Prison knew your name . 
First , Herne , then that . Something 's stirring . 
- Like what ? 
- Something dark . 
- A magic , maybe , wants to stop you . 
- Why ? 
Maybe it likes things the way they are . This order wherein toffs think they can do whatever they please to ordinary folk . 
Well , they can 't . 
What was going on there , it ain 't right . Some of them prisoners were littler than George . - It was wrong . - Yeah . 
It needed to be changed . 
Maybe it 's why I have you . Yeah . 
I don 't think I 'm supposed to go to America . 
I think we 're supposed to stay here . 
Are you agreeing with me , Billy ? 
Well , no . I 'm not saying we should rush into anything . 
No , anyone can travel the world and blow folk up , us . 
I think we 're meant to stand up when something 's wrong , and ... whack some sense into them that profit off misery and pain . 
- Yeah . - Yeah . 
Yeah . All right . 
All right . 
- What about George and Roxy ? 
- They 're best safe in Abingdon . 
So we 're in agreement , then ? 
We 're gonna save the world . 
We 'll steady on . 
We 'll start off with the continent , or England , or just Tottenham , maybe . 
I thought you were magic during your show . 
So why go around kidnapping folk ? 
We used to be a proper troupe . 
We was at Drury Lane . But there were some bad reviews . Japhia lost his part . 
So ? 
So he beat the poor sod who replaced him half to death . 
The entire troupe was tarred with the same brush . No theater would take us after that . 
Now we 're hedge-crawlers , barely scraping a living . And now , with a baby on the way . 
All he wants is to be known . Applauded like he was . 
These shows are from years and years ago . 
- Mm . - Good morning ! 
- Good morning , Amorous . 
Just do what he says , and he won 't hurt you . 
- Good morning old , reliable ... Good morning , good morning . Good morning . 
You 've ... You 've got ... A farmer had some misgivings about loaning us his barn for our performance , but we 've sorted it all out now . 
Why has the poor dove still got this on ? 
Look , we was gonna ... Who 's this ? 
Amorous . 
Amorous , you thick idiot sod ! 
Wait ! 
She had the dress ! She had the dress . 
What a blunderbuss , eh ? 
Now we 've got this useless bit of raspberry to be rid of . 
My papa is very rich . 
How rich ? 
He sells periwigs . 
Everyone wears periwigs . 
Well , that 's fine then . 
I suppose we won 't kill you just yet . 
I hope your sister ain 't late . 
Come on . 
- Uncle Jack . Uncle ... 
- We got your back , Nell . 
He 's gonna get help for George . 
Why ? What 's wrong with her ? 
She 's been taken . 
I 'm so sorry , Nelly . 
What , what do you mean she 's been taken ? 
- Nell . 
- Someone 's got George ? 
Some strollers . They want you , Nell , in exchange . 
We got this toff to read out the ransom note . 
- They 've got his betrothed too . - Yes . - So I ... I 'd better be off . 
- I thought you loved her ? I do . Of course . 
But love and circumstance don 't always align . 
Coward ! 
We 've got to go , Nell . 
They 've had George all night , and Uncle Jack won 't find help . Not in time . 
We can go straight to Uffington . 
- I need a horse , quickly . - Becky , horse . 
- And one for me . 
- No . - I 'm coming , Nell . - No ! 
- Where 's Rasselas ? 
- No idea . Which way do I go ? 
Nell ! - What are you doing ? 
Go back . 
- Nell , I 'm helping ! 
What ? No . Go back , Roxy . 
Slow down . 
Wait , Nell . 
I can 't go back . The inn 's not safe anymore . 
This isn 't safe . 
- And where is Rasselas ? - He ran off . 
He did not . 
Roxy , it was ... There was this riot , and then this huge wall came between us . 
I passed out . 
I looked for him , but London is massive , Roxy . 
But it 's when we 're separated , that 's when everything falls apart . 
Let 's go get George back . 
- We 're better together . All right ? - All right . 
Godolphin . 
Poynton . You are recovered . 
Her Majesty has been feeling your absence greatly . 
She needs loyal men about her . 
The Jacobites will seek to take advantage of what happened at Newgate . All this chaos . It has always struck me how much you despise them . 
The Jacobites are greedy hypocrites . 
They 're attempting to put a puppet on the throne so they could rule . 
A child , a stranger to England . 
And they are among us , Poynton . Even in the Privy Council . 
You must tell me if you hear anything . 
Of course . 
I did hear a talk of a traitor . 
- One sending letters to France . 
- Who ? 
Oh , I think you know . 
Lords Godolphin , Poynton . 
What is the meaning of this ? 
Is it true ? 
- Locked in his desk . 
- You don 't mean mine ? There 's been some mistake . 
- Poynton , tell them . 
- I had hoped I was wrong . 
Poynton ? 
- What ? - Come on . - Get your hands off me ! 
The Courant should do more interviews . Better ones ! 
" Quite polite ? " Interview me . 
She could have killed me . I saw her face firsthand . 
Valerian , now , support his head . 
Merciless creature . 
- I could put that in The Medley . - Yes . 
- Uh , Valerian . I said support his head . 
The Weekly Journal may concede she had a certain grubby panache . 
Chop , chop . 
Now there is a risk that Nell Jackson will go to ground after the riot , and that won 't do . 
The country is in chaos . 
People don 't want tepid , they want torrid . 
And she 's all they want to read about . 
So we need something that will have her stomping about again . 
Ideas ? 
" Nell Jackson eats babies . " 
It 's been done . 
" Known spreader of warts " ? No , Valerian . Vulgar . One must balance bold and exceptional fashion choices with subtlety . 
Otherwise , what is one but ... rather gauche . 
Nelly Jackson won 't care about any of that . 
I know her type . 
Yes . 
This . This will light a fire under her . 
So , um , as to my betrothed ... The Courant will report that the fact that he 's the only prisoner not to have escaped Newgate is a bold statement of his innocence . 
While The Medley will wonder if he 's too stupid to find his way out . 
- Hmm ? - Eularia ? Yeah ? 
No , I don 't want a syllabub . 
I think you 'll want to hear this . 
- I said go away ! 
Why did you put me here ? This isn 't my room . 
Well , you are Lord Blancheford now . 
You should have left me in London with my friends . 
You were alone when my men found you . 
Would you like me to describe what state you were in ? 
- It is all right . 
- It is not all right . 
It will never be all right again because of you . 
No , Thomas . Not because of me . 
Do you think any man would have done what you did ? 
- You urged me . 
- And you went through with it ! 
The realization that we can have anything we want if we are prepared to do anything for it . 
Well , some men see it as limitless opportunity . 
Whereas some see only ... Horror . 
No , no , no . 
Don 't , don 't . Don 't , don 't . 
I understand . 
I do . 
And ... I-I fear I must apologize , Thomas . 
You cannot bear it , can you ? 
- No . - All right . 
What if I told you ... I could make it stop ... in an instant ? 
Guilt . Shame . 
Do you know where they stem from ? 
Responsibility . 
You can let it go . 
You will find , dearest rodent ... that Isambard Tulley ain 't someone it 's wise to ignore . 
And that we all have our price . 
So will you stop interrupting me ? 
Only if you ... Lady Eularia - - Who are you talking to ? 
Angel of angels . 
I was , uh , just attempting to train a charming little mouse . 
I haven 't had a visitor . Oh , new clothes for the trial ? 
Which Valerian 's little friend tells us has been moved to tomorrow , since you 've somehow contrived to be the last fool prisoner left in Newgate . 
Oh , it 's splendid news . I 'll be set free early . 
You have everything in hand . You have greased every palm there is that needs to be greased . 
This time , tomorrow , we 'll be planning the wedding . 
Or you 'll be dead . 
Your little friend has unleashed chaos . 
So the powers that be have been throwing their weight around . 
And if the verdict is guilty , they 'll hang you immediately . 
But money still talks . 
Don 't tell me the courts are actually lawful now . 
I must be off . 
The Medley is doing a special feature on your crimes , and selling faster than we can print it . 
Eularia . 
Bye , Charles . 
The Earl of Godolphin has been arrested as a Jacobite . 
- Godolphin ? - Mm-hmm . 
Some letters discovered amongst his effects . 
Godolphin is the captain of the Queen 's bodyguard . 
Precisely . 
And now he is a guest of the Tower . 
Her Majesty has requested I visit her in London tomorrow . 
I suspect she will hand the guard to me . 
You plan to use them ? 
They will allow me to take the Queen in hand , so James 's troops can advance without opposition . 
What are the news sheets saying ? 
The Medley claims the country is on the brink of revolt . That the prison was overrun by a people 's army led by Nell Jackson . 
Whether they know it was you or not , you have shaken London . 
You have recovered , then ? 
I feel excellent . 
It is a marvelous thing , isn 't it ? 
Intoxicating . 
Yes . 
I nearly had Jackson . 
And you will again . 
You had her on the run . 
The spell evolved . The prison took over . 
It burned up the hair we used to track her . 
We will find her . 
I wonder if you understand how talented you are . How important . 
Such power isn 't for the likes of Nell Jackson . 
There are ways to deal with her . 
- All right , I 'm here . 
Welcome , ladies and gentlemen , one and all . 
Oy . Where 's my sister ? 
We have a very special treat today . 
The hideous , the vicious , the bloodthirsty , the diabolical , Nelly Jackson ! 
What in the ... You are here to witness history . Nelly Jackson 's capture and downfall by the one ... the only ... The handsome , the heroic , the magnificent , the masterful , the prodigy , the genius , the virtuoso ... Japhia . 
To bring you today 's very special performance , a scheme has been concocted . 
An exchange . Nell Jackson for her little sister . 
Yeah . Where is she then ? 
" Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes ? " 
" I must . Must . " 
Shakespeare . 
- I 've read a lot about you , Nelly Jackson . - Yeah ? 
Impossible to defeat in a fight , they say . 
Impossible to harm . 
But she ain 't . 
George . 
Stay still . 
He never said we was going to hurt her . 
Put that down and I 'll do whatever you want . 
You lucky people are about to witness not just the capture , but also the rightful execution of one of the monsters of our age . 
I didn 't do none of the things you are accusing me of . 
- I 'm not - - 
- What you are is beside the point . It 's what they perceive you to be . 
I kill you and I 'm a hero . 
Jackson 's cup contains poison . 
We 'll toast to her demise . 
It doesn 't matter how strong or fast the demon inside you is , Nelly Jackson . I doubt it can save you from hemlock you drink yourself . 
It 's the other one . 
We 're all good , right ? If I drink that ? 
Let 's not test it out . I - - - What ? 
- Well , I don 't know , Nelly . I 'm only human . 
Do something then . 
Distract him . 
Poison ? 
That old chestnut . 
Boo . It 's a classic . 
Well , these folk will tell people what you 've done , - and you 'll get the noose . 
- It all depends on the spin , don 't it ? 
- And them papers , they don 't like you . 
- I ain 't done nothing wrong . 
I am sick of seeing your face in every paper . 
Every page , your face where mine should be . 
You 'll be dead , and I 'll be known . 
Turn out that light ! 
Oh , dear . 
The Great Japhia looks a little sweaty to me . 
Don 't you think ? 
Put out one of the mite 's eyes . 
Put both of them out . 
- They don 't work that well anyway . 
- All right . All right . 
To fate . 
Yeah . Cheers . 
Goodbye , Nelly Jackson . 
- No , no , no . Nelly , no . 
No , I can 't . 
I messed up . Did I ? 
I swallowed a fly . 
You all right ? 
Just fine . 
Kill them ! 
My last words - - 
We didn 't need to hear them . Well done . 
That were the best thing I 've seen in years . 
Uh ... Good luck with that . 
Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go , Roxy . 
One of the Army wives had her baby come during a march . 
She just popped down the side of the road and squeezed it out behind a bush . 
I 'm just saying . 
- That 's considerate of her . - Yeah , it was . 
And it was snowing . 
She caught up with us by lunchtime with her baby . 
It 's very respectable . No carrying on . 
The miracle of birth is not for me . 
What are your thoughts on " Rebel Nelly " as a title ? 
Uh , well , I 'm not helping you write a show about me . 
There 's enough guff out there already . 
Well , I just want you to know , I don 't care that your father was a poacher . 
- He was not . 
Right . Of course . 
- What else does it say ? What else ? - Nothing . 
No . What ? Tell me . 
Obviously , slander . Obviously . 
But they just say , you know , the apple doesn 't fall far from the tree . 
That the whole family 's gone bad , that they 're thieves too , and ... you know , generally , no better than they ought to be . 
- Right . - Well , you know the way they write about women sometimes . 
It doesn 't matter . 
People won 't believe it . 
No , that 's exactly the tripe folk will believe . 
Right . 
We are gonna smash the presses up . 
They 'll just build more . 
Well , maybe no one 's ever stood up to them before . 
All those rags do is feed off misery and make more of it , Roxy . 
They make monsters like that Japhia slug , and tell lies . 
We need to show them that they can 't get away with it . 
People need to know that the truth matters . 
Because it does . 
We can stop them . 
I think that 's what we 're meant to do . 
Yeah . All right . 
All right . 
Let 's go . 
Can we look for Mr. Rasselas too , Nelly ? 
Youse up to giving us a lift ? 
Sofia . 
Rasselas ? 
I 've been trying to get to you . I need to speak to you . 
Is she here ? 
Nell ? 
No . 
I was at Newgate yesterday . 
You were ? 
What was it like ? 
I read about it in the news sheets . 
- You were hurt ? - I thought ... What ? 
I thought I heard your voice . 
What did I say ? 
- What did I sound like ? - I came here to find out why , Sofia . And this bloke 's here . 
The Earl of Poynton . 
He 's on the Privy Council . 
They 're folk that move in circles like that . they 're different . 
Perhaps to you . 
What 's he doing there ? 
He 's a friend . 
Has he got something over you , Sofia ? You can tell me . 
He has only ever helped me . 
And I am always in control . 
I had enough control in Newgate . 
You chose to do that ? 
- What happened there was monstrous . 
- No . It was monstrous to abandon me when I needed you most . 
The night my father died , you threw away all our history . - What history ? 
- What history did we have ? 
- You are my friend . 
Sofia , your father bought me ! 
When you were too old for me , I was sent to the stables like an old toy . 
I never treated you like that ! 
You were kind to me and , and you stood between me and Thomas . And I am grateful for that . But it was never ... I was never here by choice . 
Sofia , you could end all of this . Just by telling the truth . 
Don 't you know what they 'd do to Thomas ... if they found out ? 
He 's my family . 
What about Nell ? What about her family ? 
Do you remember when Thomas used to catch tadpoles and beetles and spiders ? 
And you and I ... we 'd set them free . And if he ever tried to take it out on me , you 'd stop him . 
Because you 're fair , Sofia . 
Go back to her . 
Go back . 
Wait . 
You will get wound rot . 
Good luck .
