Let me get you up to speed . 
This morning , the Queen made me Captain of her Bodyguard . 
Allow me to take you to a place of safety . 
She is to take up residence at Broadwater Hall . 
Sofia . She 's behind of all of it . 
Possess each mortal thing upon the ... They 're going after the Queen . 
Hope you 're feeling lucky , Nelly . 
I don 't need luck . I got you . 
I think we 're meant to stand up when something 's wrong . 
This is what we were sent to the planet for . For these poor souls . You 're my friend . 
Sofia , your father bought me ! 
Rasselas isn 't my real name . Lord Blancheford gave it to me . 
My real name is lost . 
Jackson didn 't kill my father . - Thomas did . 
- Did he ? 
- It was him that put the idea in my head . 
I could make it stop in an instant . 
Isambard Tulley , you will hang for your crimes . 
- Stop him ! 
- I know you 're there , Sofia . 
- Ras ! - You 're not going ... Anywhere . 
Nell Jackson , she knows about the invasion . 
We take the Queen tomorrow . 
We 're gonna stop them . 
Oy . Put it away , Billy . You 're making me nervous . 
She 's late . 
- She ain 't . 
- Well then , where 's the carriage ? 
If we don 't catch the Queen here , then Poynton will get her . Then England will be invaded . 
Then there 'll be a war and massive bloodshed and slaughter and devastation . 
Where is she ? 
This is the fastest road to Broadwater . 
She 'll be on it . We 're fine . 
Uh , have you thought about what to say ? 
If you get it wrong and she 'll ignore you , get herself kidnapped or beheaded . 
Then the invasion , end of England . - The world 's - - Why not ? - Hey . 
It 's happening . 
It 's the Queen ! It 's the Queen ! 
We 're holding up the Queen ! 
- Right . Go , go , go ! 
- Oh , yeah . 
- Stand and deliver ! - Deliver ! 
We surrender . 
- What ? 
- That is disgraceful , that is . 
What if she was a proper highwayman , woman ? 
Unbelievable . - Give me that . 
- Yeah . 
It 's Nell Jackson . Apologies for hijacking you , Your Majesty . Oh . Only there is a plot against you at Broadwater Hall . 
Those two catsticks were driving you right into it . 
So we thought it was best to , you know , catch you before the Jacobites do . 
Nelly Jackson . 
- Mr. Devereux . 
- Where 's the blooming Queen ? 
Well , I don 't know , do I ? Probably in the other carriage . 
- The other what ? - She uses decoy carriages to trick people into thinking she 's inside and avoid ... Well , this . 
- What are you doing in it ? 
- Eularia tipped me off . 
An empty carriage speeding away from London is the perfect means of escape because I 'm a wanted criminal now , thanks to you . 
All right . 
Broadwater it is , then . 
Let 's go and rescue the Queen . 
Hope youse all wearing your lucky britches . 
Aye . Hut ! You ... You are the traitor ? 
Today , you and I will take a trip to our Jacobite friends in Scotland . 
And once James has ascended the throne , your people can squabble for the best of you , of your execution . 
Arrest her . 
Stay . 
Great ! 
To it ! 
Stop ! 
- Stay where you are ! 
- Stay where you are ! 
The Queen is in our custody . 
Our names will be in the history books . 
And Poynton ... You 're pleased he found you in London . 
You 're pleased he 's brought you into it all ? 
Yes . 
You are friends with him , then ? 
You 've rethought your earlier prejudice against him ? 
Entirely . 
To blame one 's circumstances on society . External influences . 
It 's an abdication of will . It makes one nothing more than a tool . 
You sound like ... Did Poynton give you this ? 
Take it off . - Thomas . 
- It can 't be removed . 
No ! Stop ! 
- What are you doing ? 
- I don 't know . 
I just ... I think I have to do something . 
I felt something bad . 
Something evil inside Broadwater . 
But Nell said stay here while she gets the Queen out . 
It 's not the Queen , it 's something else . 
I have a feeling . I think I need to trust it . 
Right , well , we 're armed . 
And Nell is dealing with the guards and I know a way in , so ... Keep an eye on him , George . 
Come on . 
Thomas is wearing a pendant . Remarkably like your ring . 
It 's a token to comfort him . 
You only wanted him close once you learned that he killed Father . 
Years of planning to reach this crucial point . 
The Queen in my power , England at my fingertips . 
It all hinges on the next few hours . 
And we 're talking about Thomas ? 
The carriage to Scotland is ready . 
And it will not depart until you tell me why Thomas is wearing a pendant which cannot be removed . 
Patricide twists and warps and marks the soul in such a way that it can be used by ... those practiced in our particular brand of influence . 
Used ? Instead of using the energy to conjure , it is possible to simply draw it into oneself . 
- When the process is complete , it makes you ... immeasurably powerful . 
Permanently . 
Then why have you not done it ? 
It 's something that , in my current state , I cannot attempt without terrible risk . 
But you , with your natural strength and talents , you could do it . 
Nell Jackson would be nothing to you . 
What would happen to Thomas ? 
He is already lost . But you could defeat everyone , Sofia . 
You were the one who put the thought of killing my father in his head . 
It would never have occurred to him . 
You thought you could play with us all . 
With me ! 
Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . 
Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . 
Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . 
Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . 
Your magic is no match for mine now , I 'm afraid . 
One should never have something to lose . 
It makes you weak . 
Sir ? Sir ! 
Two patrols gone . 
- It must be that devil Jackson . 
- Yes . Do you hear that , Lady Wilmot ? 
It seems Nell Jackson has decided to pay us a visit . 
Such a pity you won 't be there to see her die . 
Oy ! Billy , oy . 
- Yeah , what ? 
- We ain 't done . 
- Right you are , boss . 
- That right ? 
- Put down your weapon ! 
- I thought you was my boss . 
- The way you carry on . 
- Yeah . 
I said , put down your weapon . 
Avoiding the conversation . 
- Had enough ? - Yeah , right . 
Blimey , aye , that 's a big boy . 
Her Majesty had better be grateful . 
What ? 
You are some pixie . 
We 're kind of great at this . 
Come on , then . Are you with me ? 
- I 'm with you , Nelly . From beginning to end . 
You know , I heard Broadwater Hall has an exceedingly fine collection of ... 
What ? 
Money . 
You 'll be fine on your own for a little while , don 't you think ? 
Yeah , I 'm all better from my gunshot wound . And I 'm not scared of Jacobites or wolves . 
- And after my recent kidnapping , I - - 
Come on , then . 
I might be able to find you some new spectacles . 
Where do you stand on petty theft ? 
Fond of it . 
It 's coming from him . I can feel it . 
Please . No more ghosts . 
- He summoned you to torment me . 
- Who ? 
Let it stop ! 
Quiet ! 
Thomas , Thomas . Thomas , it 's me . 
It 's Rasselas . 
I 'll give you anything . Just stop haunting me . 
A secret . I 'll tell you the secret . 
I shouldn 't have done it . I shouldn 't have kept it from you . Fine , fine , fine . Tell me the secret quietly and I 'll stop haunting you . 
Amadin . 
It 's Amadin . 
Say that again . 
Amadin . 
- What does it mean ? 
- Is it a spell ? 
I , I found the papers when I was 10 . That 's your name . 
That 's your real name . Father told me never to tell you . 
You knew this whole time ? 
He told me not to tell you ! 
You knew my name ? My , my real name ? 
Why did he ... Why did he change it ? 
He just didn 't like it . 
- Rasselas . 
- That 's not my name ! 
- Say it again ! 
- Amadin . 
Amadin . 
He deserves this . 
This isn 't just about him . 
We need to find Nell . - And figure out what 's going on . 
She 's not safe . 
Majesty ! 
- I 'm Nell and I 'm here to save you . 
Right . I 've got rid of all the guards I could find . 
I think it 'll be safe to sneak you out . 
You all right ? 
Nell Jackson ? 
Yeah . 
Whatever 's in there must be valuable . 
Do you think ... I knew it ! 
How did you capture it ? 
What ? 
The spirit inside you . 
Source of all your powers . How do you control it ? 
I don 't control no one . 
Look , I 'm trying to save you . 
At last , your Majesty . 
I have fought through fire and flood - to be here in your hour of need . - Where 's Nelly ? 
You think you can stop this ? 
A battle over the crown itself ? 
The future of the nation , the world . 
Allow me , Your Majesty . 
Isambard Tulley , I presume . 
Uh ... You ... Nelly Jackson ? 
A barkeep 's daughter . 
You think you have a say ? 
- After all that . - After all that . - Utterly powerless . - Utterly powerless . 
How disappointing . 
Rox , what you doing ? 
The pendant . 
You must be Poynton , then . 
Did you know that Thomas killed your father to impress me ? 
I found it all rather trivial , if I 'm honest . But it set something in motion . 
A whining buzz . 
You , Nell Jackson , are an insect in a land of giants . 
A fly in the tent of a general about to lead his army to war . 
Inconsequential . But my goodness , are you irritating . 
It will give me pleasure to tear your wings off before I lead an invasion and reshape this country - into the rightful ... - Yeah . 
Well , sounds like finishing you off solves a lot of my problems , don 't it ? 
I 'm here to give you a bad day . 
Oh , I 'm really going to enjoy destroying you . 
How about you put a cork in it ? 
And let 's do take this outside . 
Right then . 
Free me now from hidden foes . 
Uncreate , undo , and loose the bonds . 
Just face me , you coward . 
That time may cease , and fire catch the night . 
Oh , careful . It 's quite strong ... 
He 's getting weaker . 
All that lies before me to destroy ! 
This fatal dart , this sure destruction flies ! 
Oy , the Queen 's escaping . 
I thought you and him were going to take over England together . 
Come on . 
Your Majesty . 
Surprise ! 
Just a bit further . Thomas ! 
- Roxy ! 
- Nell , it 's Thomas . 
The magic 's coming from him . 
What 's wrong with him ? 
Poynton is feeding off the darkness inside Thomas . 
The spell will kill him . 
Oh , god , you idiot ! 
Can 't you stop this spell ? 
I don 't have anything left . 
Nell ? 
George ! 
Mr. Devereux told us to hide up here where it was safe . 
No , you can 't be here . None of you can be here . 
- It 's too late . 
- Let 's go ! 
No ! 
I need to stay and deal with Poynton while you get the Queen out . 
Roxy . Roxy , please . 
You need to look after George . Please . 
I will remember this , Nell Jackson . 
I won 't leave without him . 
You 're going to die . 
Yeah , well ... I was never gonna die in bed . 
The spell 's stopping his heart . 
He needs help . 
Billy . 
We can 't defeat Poynton . 
He 's too strong . 
You need to help Thomas . 
How ? 
You need to leave me and go into him . And fight the spell from within . 
I 've never done that before . 
If Thomas dies , the spell 's finished , and Poynton wins . 
So we can 't let him die . 
But , Nelly , you 're my person . 
I know . 
We 'll be alone . I , I don 't want to be alone . 
Nell Jackson . 
Where are you ? 
Billy ? 
Well , I don 't know what will happen . What if I can 't come back ? 
We don 't have a choice , though , do we ? 
What if I 'm no good on my own ? 
You will be , Billy Blind . 
You will be . 
Goodbye , Nelly Jackson . 
Wait . Billy . 
No . 
Mr. Devereux . 
- Mr. Devereux . 
- Did it work ? 
Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . Power , death , destruction in my hand I bear . 
You will speak to the Queen on my behalf . 
You 'll tell her I am not to blame . 
That we were deceived and coerced by Poynton but turned against him at the vital moment . 
That it is thanks to us that your intervention succeeded . 
You had me accused of murder . Thrown out of my home . My sister 's thrown out . 
He killed my dad . And to save that piece of filth , 
I just lost the most important thing . 
" Please . " 
That 's what you want to hear , isn 't it ? 
Right . 
How about this ? 
I 'll do you a favor . 
Yeah ? 
I 'll let you go . 
Let 's see how the pair of you like life on the run . 
I will not forget this . 
Yeah , well , I 'm not likely too , either . 
Billy . 
- Nell ? - She 's there . 
Nell . 
What happened ? 
Nelly ! 
Is it possible to get multiple knighthoods ? 
Well ... Nell Jackson of Tottenham and her sisters , Mistress Roxanne Trotter , Mistress Georgina Trotter and Mr. Amadin of Benin . 
Nell Jackson . I hereby pronounce you innocent of the murder of Lord Blancheford and pardon you and your fellows of all crimes . 
Sir Charles Devereux . Knight of the realm . 
I expect you 'd like a quote ? 
No , seriously , stop clapping . Thank you . 
Nell Jackson , step forward . 
Your unusual abilities have clearly been gifted to you in order to uphold our crown . 
We have heard that you can catch bullets clean out of the air and we think a demonstration is in order . 
Hold on . 
- Three . 
- Nell . 
Two . 
- Wait . Sorry . Hold on . 
- One . 
Stop ! 
I ain 't some cheap trick for toffs to gawp at . 
You misunderstand us . 
We intend to appoint you as Captain of our Bodyguard . 
Like that horrible Poynton was ? 
It would be a great honor , previously conferred only upon Peers of the Realm . 
I don 't want that . 
I don 't need it . 
But ... thanks . 
You are refreshing , aren 't you ? 
Then , what do you want , Nell Jackson ? 
Have you heard of a pub ... called the " Talbot " ?
