Oo-er missus . 
- That was Herne the Hunter . 
- Who ? 
When Herne rides again , it heralds the death of the monarch . 
I 'm beginning to wonder if you 've been sent to the planet for something special . 
The beast was slaughtered , beheaded by Nell Jackson . 
Poynton ? 
Lady Sofia Wilmot . 
I dabble in things that most people are frightened of . 
You want me to kill my own father ? 
- Let 's split them up . - What did you say ? 
Thomas . 
- You fiend . - Murder ! 
- Liar . - Leave me alone ! 
Thomas ! 
George 's been shot ! 
- Do you know him ? 
- Isambard Tulley . 
No bail at any price ! 
It 's a plague village . 
We 're gonna scrub this table clean . And then I 'm gonna get that bullet out . - How ? 
George just got a fever . 
She 's burning up . I need to get her to a physician . 
Read about her , Nelly Jackson . 
- I won 't be long . 
- I 'll get some supplies . 
Yeah . And a news sheet . - You got some lolly ? 
Oh , hello . 
I need a surgeon . It 's urgent . Is he in ? 
- Yes , dear . Come in . - Lovely . 
Henry , it 's the Duchess of Argyll traveling up to London . - Her sister 's been shot by a highwayman . - Your Grace . 
You might not be the right person , but perhaps you 'll advise me . 
I 've removed the bullet myself , but my sister 's feverish , and I fear the wound might be ... not right . 
Oh , that is a possibility . 
You see , when a bullet goes in , it takes things in with it . 
Clothing . Dirt . 
And if those things aren 't removed too , then , yes , death can occur . 
So ... So the wound needs to be reopened ? 
Well ... Who 's the best person here to deal with it ? 
Oh , you won 't find anyone else . 
All the younger surgeons are off with the army in Europe . 
If I can just remember where my bag might be . Henry , here . 
- Take care , Henry . - I will . 
Ah ! MacGregor . Help Mr. Tuplow into the carriage . 
Aye , Milady . May I put this basket on the carriage with you , Milady ? Or else it will go everywhere . 
Certainly . Certainly . 
- Great . All in . 
- Yes , thank you . 
Great , great . Ooh . And MacGregor , do try and remember to address me as " Your Grace . " 
Oh , oh , sorry , Your Gra - - I can 't - 
I wish ... I wish I knew what to do . 
" Ointment . to cure ... wounds to the flesh . " 
" What , wool of bat , fairy 's fingers , cuckoo 's bread . " Where am I meant to get fings like this ? 
" An old maid 's nightcap , beggar 's buttocks , " Nice . " Devil 's dung and a few blind eyes . " 
Yeah , obviously , because they 're easy to come by . 
" Cuckoo 's bread . Fairy 's fingers . " 
Wasn 't this terrible highwaywoman , Your Grace , who shot your sister ? 
Uh . The one that 's in all the broadsheets . Black Nelly . Blue Nelly . Wild Nelly Something . Um ... Jackson . 
Nell Jackson . Yes . No . Well , it might have been . 
- Apparently , she 's , uh , fearsome . 
- Is she ? Well , they say she can take on 10 men at once . 
And if you look directly into her eyes , she can turn a man to stone , or jelly or , um , I don 't know , something . 
Medically , of course , it 's not possible . But , uh ... she 's obviously upset somebody . 
She did have a certain feminine-inity to her . 
But no , she wasn 't fearful . Not at all . She was really rather polite , in fact . 
But she shot your sister . 
Well , I think it was an accident , really . And she didn 't actually steal anything . 
But she held you up . 
I think she ... 
Sorry . Just , just for protection . Nothing to worry about . 
Yeah , I think she just wanted a chat , mm-hmm . Blather . 
She , she didn 't relieve you of your weapons , then ? 
No . No . 
Did you not try to shoot her after she shot your sister ? 
No , she was off ! 
And , you know , I think her gun went off accidentally , to be honest . 
And I think , I think it must have upset her because the last thing she said when she went off was , " I am innocent . 
I never shot that fella , that Lord . 
- What they were all accusing me of . " - Did she ? 
Uh . Something along the lines of that ? Yeah . 
- Good heavens ! - What ? 
Does that say ? " Isambard Tulley captured in Slough . " I-I ... 
I can 't read the little print without my magnifier . 
- Um , can you read it to me ? - No , I can 't read either . 
No , not without ma wee spectacles , - which I 've lost . - Yeah . 
I think they 're somewhere here , but ... Sorry . Is that what , is that really what it says ? 
Yes . 
- Here , just what ... - Uh . " Isambard Tulley captured in Slough . 
This reporter can confirm that the infamous villain and scourge of the great city of London and surrounding area , Isambard Tulley was conveyed in chains to Newgate Prison at a quarter to midnight from Slough , where he was captured by a party of thief-takers . " 
You , get up . You 're coming with me . 
Is he being released ? 
No , sunshine . He 's a dirty Jacobite . 
He doesn 't like the queen . He wants her off the throne . 
- So , guess what ? - What ? 
He 's being hanged . 
- Where are we going ? 
- I 'll tell you when we get there . 
Get in . Get in . 
What 's this ? 
You obviously know someone in high places . 
Yes . Yes , I do . 
Thank you very much . Which is why I am not Isambard Tulley . 
- You keep telling yourself that . - Who lives here ? 
You do . Like I said , you obviously know someone in high places . 
What about these ? 
" And I am loyal of the Lords throughout whole generations . 
For the Lord will judge his people and he will repent himself concerning his servants . 
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold , the work of men 's hands . - They have mouths , but they speak not . - Eyes have they , but they see not . They have ears . But they hear not . 
Neither is there any breath in their mouths . " " For the Lord will judge his people and will repent himself concerning his servants . 
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold . " 
Where have you been ? 
London . 
- Not to see Poynton . - Poynton , yes . 
- You shouldn 't bother with him . 
What is he ? Thomas ? 
He 's dangerous . Poisonous . 
Listen . You need to pull yourself together . You need to believe in your own innocence . Otherwise , this isn 't going to work . 
Thomas , look at me . 
You didn 't ... kill Father . Nell Jackson did . That is our truth now . 
But I can only protect you if you stop indulging in this weakness . 
Do you understand ? 
Good . 
So ... 
He 's had some kind of fit of apoplexy and he needs to recover . 
I don 't want him here . 
Nonsense . He 's fond of you , and he can help us . But right now , we can help him . 
I 'll continue to employ Jarrold to pursue Nell Jackson in the more usual manner . 
But Poynton ... What he can do is , is extraordinary . 
- He 's coming to us tonight . - Sofia ... 
What ? 
It was him that put the idea in my head to do it . - How ? 
Thomas . He wasn 't there - - - No . Before I ... I used to tell him things like ... that I was short of money and that I needed my inheritance . And he would say things like , " Well , Thomas , what stands between you and your inheritance ? " 
Yes , but ... - he surely didn 't mean - - - Oh , he did . He did , Sofia ! 
I was cajoled into believing that killing Father was an option . 
And he put that idea in my head . And if he hadn 't ... 
Then , it would never have happened . Thomas , you ... I told him it was Jackson and he believed me . 
He 's on our side . 
Whatever conversations you 've had with him in the past , he believed me . 
You , you must believe it too . 
Thomas ... Do you understand nothing about ... Don 't make me disinherit you . 
You turn my stomach . 
Oh , thank you . 
What is this place ? 
Well , we think it 's an old plague village . 
You 've been hours ! I thought you was never coming back . 
Ah , Daisy . 
- Is he a surgeon ? - Yes . This is Mr. Tuplow . 
My lady 's maid will show you where my sister , the Lady Georgiana is . She 's in here . 
- Devereux is in Newgate . - What ? Can 't you read ? 
Nelly ? Where 's Nelly ? Nelly ? Who 's Nelly ? 
It 's my name . Yes ! 
Same as the highway lady . 
Now , Lady Georgiana . Mr. Tuplow is here to examine your wound and to make you better . 
Better than ever before . 
Why are you talking funny ? 
- What 's that slime ? 
Just some herbs and stuff . That 's meant to be good for flesh wounds and that . Right . 
Right ! Right . Carry on . 
Uh , the ointment has bought her some time . 
But the wound is livid . 
As I suspected , there is still corruption within - and unless it comes out - - 
- And you can fix that . 
And then ? 
And then . 
- Yes . 
- Yes . 
The corruption may have already spread to the blood . 
So ? 
What ? That 's it , there 's nothing you can do ? 
No . I 'm saying , if I open up the wound again , there may be a chance that I can save the child 's life . 
But you may have to accept that even after we put her through the trauma of the procedure . That ... This is the child 's allotted span . 
If she dies ... It 's all my fault . So , can you please do everything you can ? 
Please ? 
Certainly . 
What 's in this ? 
Just , um , wool of bat . Couple of fairy 's fingers . Cuckoo 's bread , uh , a few blind eyes , an old maid 's nightcap , and beggar 's buttocks . - Mm . 
- Oh , um , and some devil 's dung . 
- So not much . Just that . - Good . 
Now ... Lady Georgiana , I 'm going to have to open that wound again , because I think there 's a little bit of dirt in there that needs to come out , and you 're going to have to be very brave . 
When it 's all over , we 're going to use this ointment , which is going to help you heal . 
Now , how does that sound ? Hmm ? 
- Yes , sir . - Good girl . 
Can you help get Lady Georgiana onto the table , please ? 
- All right , Lady Georgiana ... 
- Didn 't know you could read . 
- Take it slow . I can 't . 
Something happened today when you were gone . 
Yeah , what ? 
I think ... I think I ... And it 's something I 've been aware of for a while . I think I can see or feel things other people can 't . 
What do you mean ? 
I think I 'm magic . 
Right . 
Visiting . 
Lady Eularia Moggerhangar . 
Oh , God . 
Oh , I knew it was you . 
Eularia , how delightful . You need to get me out of here . 
Most people stand up when I enter a room . 
It isn 't as easy as it looks . 
- You 're an idiot . - Yes . 
But , look , it isn 't me . I 'm not Isambard Tulley . 
Do you realize they 'll hang you ? Unless I choose to pull a few strings ? 
Why would you choose not to , best beloved ? 
Why would you choose not to get me out of this hideous misunderstanding ? 
You were arrested in Slough . 
Oh , well , I , I didn 't know it was Slough . I was just trying to get from A to B. 
And if being in Slough isn 't ugly enough , oh , word has it that you 're in the company of some grubby highwaywoman . 
Um , no ? 
Word has it that you and this whoever-she-thinks-she-is posed as a married couple to cheat money out of a couple of old farts in a game of hearts ? 
- Where have you got that from ? - Oh , I don 't know . Do you know ? Uh , maybe I invented it because I 've got nothing better to do . Or maybe I misunderstood it because my brain doesn 't work properly anymore . Now , I 'm so old . 
Or maybe it 's because it 's in all the blasted news sheets ! 
Oh , the guttersnipes . What nonsense ! 
But your papers aren 't saying it 's me , though , are they ? 
Your papers aren 't saying Charles Deveraux is Isambard Tulley . 
No , of course , not . Well , not yet , anyway . 
Oh , my God , it would make a marvelous exclusive . 
Eularia , my love . You are wrong . 
Ah ! But you once told me you were when you were in your cups . 
I laughed . I didn 't believe you . But now , well . Do you know I wouldn 't mind that so much ? 
One has to have a little amusement . 
But to be strolling around the countryside with a strumpet . Please know that I am this close ... to calling off our engagement . 
Eularia , I am not Isambard Tulley . 
Nor have I been in the company of any grubby highwaywoman . 
Mm ! Then , who is she ? This Nelly Jackson ? 
Who ? 
You know , I thought you 'd been giddy lately . 
I am not sure I know what you 're talking about . 
Well , if you haven 't heard of Nelly Jackson , then , you 're the only person in England who hasn 't . She 's been selling more of my newspapers than you have . Oh . 
Her ! 
Did they catch Nelly Jackson ? No . 
She 's obviously got more about her than you do . 
So , to sum up , unless you tell me the truth , there is very little that I can do for you . 
All right ! All right ! 
So I was just passing through what I now realize was Slough on my way back up to London from a weekend shooting things in the country when my horse needed baiting . 
Right ? So I stopped , not intending to be more than five minutes . And then , suddenly there it was , right in my face , a pistol . 
Then , she made me go with her and , and , um , pretend to be Lord ... Uh ... Somebody or other and play hearts with Lord and Lady can 't remember . 
But to be honest , it seemed harmless enough . 
I didn 't know her intention was to fleece him . 
And then , suddenly , in burst all these men telling me I 'm Isambard Tulley , and I 'm outnumbered and tied up , and thrown in here . 
No , no . That 's ... Not ringing true . Tell you what , I 'll leave you to it . 
No , Eularia . 
And when you do decide to tell me the truth , then I 'll decide whether or not to move heaven and earth - to get you out of this hellhole . 
- That is the truth , Eularia . 
And they 'll be taking you back down to the disgusting bit when I 'm gone . 
I only hired this suite for five minutes so I could visit without vomiting . 
No , Eularia ! 
- Come along , Valerian . No ! No ! 
Eularia ! 
Eularia ? 
Keep warm by the fire . 
I wonder if you might drive me back to High Wycombe , young sir . 
I 've no idea how we got here . 
And Mrs. Tuplow will be anxious if I 'm not home before night falls . 
- I 'll sort the horses . - All right . 
Wait . Money . How much would you like ? 
I , I usually charge a guinea . 
Oh , well , I 've only got gold . Will that do ? 
It ... It 's not stolen , is it ? 
Mr. Tuplow , good heavens , no ! 
I 'll waive my fee this time . 
No , please take it . Seriously it won 't be missed . 
Not by anybody . Because the stuff I 've took , it 's all from people who have more money than they know what to do with anyway . 
Please . 
- I 'll walk you to your carriage . 
- Um . Thank you . Mr. Tuplow . 
Take care of her . 
In two or three days , she 'll be past the point of danger , hopefully . 
Well , you 'll know by then anyway , one way or another . 
- She 's a brave little thing . - Yeah , well . Sometimes you don 't get any choice in the matter , do you ? 
- You just have to be . 
- I understand that . Listen , I never shot that toff in Tottenham . 
It was his own son that did it after he shot my - - Our father . 
And I know that sounds unlikely , but it 's the truth . 
And it 's why we 're having to live like this . 
What could I do ? 
No one 's gonna believe the word of someone like me against the quality . 
You need to find a magistrate ... - I know . - ... who will listen to you . 
And then protect you until you can be fairly heard in court . Where ? 
Even if I found one who would listen , he 'd probably be too frightened to stand up to the powers that be . 
And even then , I 'd never get a fair hearing . 
My elder brother ... 
- You have an elder brother ? Yes . He 's a magistrate . 
In Oxford . You should look him up . 
Tuplow . Jeremiah . He has an address in Hollywell Lane . 
I will write to him . 
- All set . Seriously ? 
Good luck , Your Grace . 
You there , Billy ? 
Yeah , I 'm here . 
Yeah , I 'm all right . Are you all right ? 
Yeah , I 'm all right . 
So this is the plan . I 'm going to Oxford . 
- Why ? - Youse are all staying here . To see a magistrate , because George can 't go anywhere or do anything for three days . 
So on , it 's Wednesday today , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , on Saturday I 'll be back then and we 'll set off for Uncle Jack 's in Abingdon . But Mr. Devereux said that was a bad plan . 
Yeah , well , Devereux 's in Newgate . So , what does he know ? Yeah . Which is why I have to head back up to the city after that . 
He 's only in there because of us . Well , me . So I 'm gonna spring him . 
How ? 
No idea . 
I hope I haven 't frightened Thomas away . 
He 's gone to London for a change of scene . 
I 'm afraid he 's taken all this very badly . 
But ... It will be a great privilege and pleasure for me having someone so intelligent to talk to . 
You can 't begin to imagine what it 's like being blessed with a good intellect , but having no use for it . 
I want to learn everything you can teach me before you 're obliged to go back . 
I need Jackson dead . 
I 'm tempted to think that fate has thrown us together , Sofia . 
And it 's delightful to me that you are so open to the dark arts . 
I 'm tempted to think you have more potential for it than I ever did . 
Really ? 
So ... I must tell you something important . 
Do you recall asking me why I conjured Herne ? 
You said , it was a private joke with the Queen . 
I didn 't want to make her laugh . 
I wanted to terrify her . 
Are you a Jacobite ? 
Sofia , I will teach you everything I know about the arts so that you can bring this Jackson woman to justice . But in return , I need you to be my acolyte . 
I need you to do things that I cannot do anymore . 
What ? 
What things ? 
- The Queen is a traitor . 
- You are a Jacobite . 
She has squandered the authority of the crown and handed it blithely to Parliament , to the people . 
Before we know it , the most ordinary men , uh , carriage drivers , carpenters , people like Nell Jackson 's father will be able to vote . 
And then how long before Parliament itself is made up of such people ? 
It 's unthinkable . 
So ... What ... What would you have me do ? 
The rightful monarch of this country is James Francis Edward Stuart , who currently resides ignominiously in the French court . 
In a few short weeks , he will sail with an army across the channel and ... Invade . 
I 've known the boy since he was an infant . 
He trusts me above all others . 
When he becomes king , I will become his closest personal adviser . 
Sofia , half of Anne 's own Privy Council is made up of men who feel exactly as I do . 
I had hoped to conjure Herne to accompany him the young king . So people would be in awe of him with this strange , supernatural creature beside him . 
Will you help me ? 
Will you help England ? 
If you did , I have no doubt with your wit and intellect , you would be offered a place of great significance in the court of James the Third . 
I would see to that . 
I also have something to confess . 
Jackson didn 't kill my father . 
Thomas did . 
Did he ? 
Did he . Well , she was there . And it was because of her . 
And I ... for a multitude of reasons , went along with it . 
To protect him . To protect myself . 
Because if anything happens to him , I , I shan 't inherit Broadwater . 
What are you thinking ? 
Sofia , none of this matters . 
You were right to tell me . But you and Thomas made the right choice . 
- Did we ? 
- Yes . 
People like us have the burden of rule . People like Nell Jackson are dispensable . 
You made exactly the right decision . How clever of you both . 
I should like to see Thomas , once I 'm recovered . 
Convince him to return home . This is the best place for him . 
He tried to tell me that you convinced him to murder our father . 
Grief does terrible things to a person . 
And Nell Jackson . 
We must deal with Nell Jackson . Briskly . Lay the matter to rest . 
I 'll formulate a spell . Let 's see if you can execute it . 
We 'll do it together . 
- Mr. Tuplow . - Mm ? There 's a Captain Argyll to see you , sir . 
- He says he 's expected . 
Yes , yes . Show him in . 
Ah , Captain Argyll . Come in , come in . 
Well , yeah , but - - No , but - - I never even said nothing or anything . But the thing is , right ? This is going back to the same night I come home . 
This is when he starts kicking up a rumpus , this Blancheford . Thomas . But he 'd already been pestering my sister for weeks beforehand , and he shot a fella 's horse earlier that same day . 
But it was only Nathan Halliday 's , and none of us like him , because he once put his hand up Roxy 's friends sister 's skirt , and he said he didn 't even like her . So , why would he ? And then her dad went mad like it was all her fault . 
And we was all like , " What ? " and then - - Aah . Oh , sorry . Where was we ? 
I 've gone off on a tangent . 
Um ... Oh , yeah . So , that night , this Thomas , he had , like , a whip and there was this - - Puddle . Sorry , Mr. Tuplow .
