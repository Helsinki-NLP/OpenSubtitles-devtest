Help yourselves . 
Dive in . It ain 't every day a man 's daughter is back home from the dead . 
I wondered why everybody was looking at me funny . 
Today , I got held up by these highwaymen . 
That ring on your finger . You might need to donate that to the cause . 
And one of them hit me . 
- What 's your name ? 
- Billy Blind . 
- What do you mean you 're on my side ? 
- I protect you . 
I 'm untouchable . 
Charles Devereux , madam . Toff , bon viveur - - - You 're Isambard Tulley . 
- Lord , I should hope not . He 's got a 20-pound reward on his head . 
Pa 's dead . 
I ran him out of town under cover of darkness and then I killed him . 
And now they 're trying to cover it up . I want everything now . 
What stands between you and your estate ? 
You want me to kill my own father ? 
- She killed him ! 
- No . I didn 't ! 
Get after her ! George ! Roxy ! We 're leaving . 
What 's going on ? 
Where 're we going ? 
I 'll tell you when we get there ! 
Lord , Papa ! 
How can you be so angry with me ? 
There 's always an uproar in the family about marrying the eldest daughter , and now poor I must suffer in my turn ! 
Your Mama and I have been too fond of you ! - Papa . 
- If you do not receive Mr. Ledger as your lover ... Lover ? 
Has he ever once so much as cast a languishing look towards me , or , or written me a sonnet , or thrown himself at my feet ? 
Mr. Ledger is a husband of your Papa and Mama 's providing . 
And aren 't they the properest persons to dispose of you ? 
Dispose of me ? 
Oh , Papa , your head is so full of trade and commerce , that you would dispose of your daughter like a piece of merchandise ! 
My heart is my own property and at no one 's disposal but my own ! 
Her impudence amazes me . You undutiful trollop . 
Not undutiful at all , Papa ! But the truth is , my heart ... There ! It 's out , it 's said . 
You see , gentlemen , what a situation I am in ? 
No one cares . Nonsense , I think it 's generous entertaining of them to share their dirty linen with us . 
You , sir , are drunk . 
That 's a very - - Yes , yes , I am . 
- Lord , Papa ! We 've speeded up ! 
- We 're off the main highway ! 
This isn 't the road to London ! Oh , really ? - What 's occurring ? 
Stop this machine ! 
What is going on ? 
Lord , Papa , we 've stopped . 
Give me that . 
Now , peel your kit off . - What ? - Go on . 
Well , you said you wouldn 't help me if I took part in random acts of violence , Billy Blind ! 
Someone points a gun at you , I have obligations . 
Well , that 's good to know . 
Hang on . - What obligations ? 
- I don 't know . 
Where did these obligations come from ? - Now ! - That is a good question . 
- And the answer is ? - Tricky . 
I can only assume that your life is very important . - Given that I 'm here to protect it . 
- Why though ? Why ? 
And ... keep going . And who decides these things ? 
- Well , you must fit the bill . 
- What bill ? - Like I said , I 'm no wiser than you are . - Come on . 
Hurry up . 
- Yeah , but you must be - - 
- Yeah , oh , our is not to reason why . 
Ours just to get on with things , eh ? Yeah , but - - 
Papa , do something . 
Billy ? I want to see skin . Come on , all of it . Let me see it . Well , get out then . 
- You get out . 
- I 'm not next to a door . 
Well , I 'm not the only one next to a door . 
Oh , I must beg to be excused . 
Two things , sir . 
One . We don 't know what 's out there . 
And B ... I 'm a bit soft . 
You 're being advised to step outside . - By who ? - Why ? With your hands up . 
How do ? 
Lady Wilmott . Colonel Standring 's here with another gentleman . Ah . Bring them in here . Tell my brother to come downstairs . 
Tell him I don 't want to have to ask twice . 
Thomas . 
Leave me alone . 
Leave me alone ! 
Ah , Blancheford . 
Lord Standring . Did I keep you waiting ? I 'm sorry . 
Your sister 's been telling me your bereavement is taking a heavy toll on you . 
Well , and it could hardly be otherwise ? Such a brutal attack . And right before the boy 's eyes . 
I 'm sorry for your loss . Your Lordship . 
- This is Captain Jarrold . 
- How do you do ? 
If anybody can find your father 's killer , it 's Jarrold . 
By this time tomorrow , we 'll have eyes in every city and town in England , Lord Blancheford . 
Will you ? 
How ? 
You must offer a substantial reward . 
We 'll advertise it in every newspaper in print , with as vivid a description of Nell Jackson that you can give and any accomplices she may have . 
We 'll have news of them within the week . 
Within a month , she 'll be hanging from the scaffold . 
Finding her is one thing . Pinning her down may be something else . 
Thomas is right , Captain Jarrold . 
We need a lot more force than you could ever reasonably imagine . 
She fights like a demon apparently . And with the strength of 10 men . 
She 's unnatural . 
I look forward to it . 
I can count the leaves from the trees . I can see individual items . I don 't like going through other people 's things . 
Listen . I 'm not happy pilfering other people 's stuff . 
I 'm not happy to be in a position where I have to pilfer other people 's stuff . 
Cheese ! Who wants some cheese ? 
- Can I have some cheese ? 
- Yes ! Of course , it 's ours now . 
And I did apologize to them . 
I did explain that I was in a tight spot through no fault of my own , and with mouths to feed , And I was just ... I was redistributing some wealth . 
What did they say ? 
You will hang . 
Not a lot . 
Yeah . Well . I was never gonna die in bed . 
- Shouldn 't you , um ... 
- Yes , Miss ? Tie us up ? So we can 't escape , sir . 
Oh , I 've not got any rope . You 'll just have to pretend . 
Don 't waste your sorrows on them , Roxy . 
These people have more stuff than they know what to do with . 
You know what 's vulgar ? 
Now why does one man need 10 pairs of pants , while another man , not three feet away , has to walk down the streets with his bottom cheeks hanging out of his galligaskins ? 
If the world was a better place , the world was a fairer place , none of this would be happening . 
- I know . 
I know that . - I want to go home . 
I 've been thinking about what to do . 
And none of yous lot have done anything wrong , - so in a good world - - 
- I have . I 've prigged this prancer off His Lordship . 
That 's a one-way trip to the three-legged mare if ever there was one . 
I know it 's not in the same league as what you did - - Didn 't do . But . Just , saying . 
I 'll be doing the Tyburn Jig , same as you , if they get ahold of me . Yeah. and I was talking to these two . So , I 'll deal with you in a minute . 
- Oh . - Get out . 
In a good world , I 'd find a magistrate who might listen to the truth . But in the real world , that 's not gonna happen . 
So , now I 've got some vittles down my gullet and I can think straight . 
What I think we should do ... is head out west via the back lanes and the tracks less well-trod , then I 'm gonna drop yous two off with Uncle Jack in Abingdon . 
Is Uncle Jack in Abingdon a real person ? Yeah , of course . He 's Dad 's baby brother . 
What about you , Nell ? 
What are you gonna do ? 
Chances are once word gets out about this latest caper they 'll think we 're on the north road . 
So , if we was to light out west that would put us ahead of the game . 
And once I 've dropped you off in Abingdon ... I 'll leg into Bristol , sneak onboard a packet , - and sail to America . - America ? 
What ? Yes . 
Once I 've got settled , and I 've made something of myself . I 'm gonna send for you . 
- What about him ? 
- Who ? Yeah , of course . Give me a minute . 
I need a word with you , kid . Over here . 
Hurry up . 
' Sup , boss ? 
I ain 't your boss . 
Look , you need to take that horse back . 
- Blame me . 
- Eh ? Say I kidnapped you . Or something . But then you managed to give me the slip . 
All right ? Look , this isn 't your mess . It 's mine . 
But I need you to take yourself back there , and then I don 't have to worry about you as well as everything else . 
I don 't wanna go back . I 'd just get bruised by that buffoon , Thomas . 
All right . Don 't go back , go where you like . But I 'm gonna drop these nippers off where they have a roof over their heads and then no one ain 't seeing me for dust . 
- Including you . 
Because that 's how it is . 
Where are you going ? 
Fill your boots , take some of them nice warm threads . Pinch a pair of them pops and a blade so you can look after yourself , and then we 'll all bid one another adieu . All right ? 
- Can I not just hang about with you ? 
- No . Can I not be useful to you , Nelly Jackson ? 
- Uh-uh . - Look , if ... if you 'd have let me come and take the carriage with you this morning , you would 've seen how useful I could be . 
Yeah . I ain 't no double act . 
I did try that with Captain Jackson , and all I learned at the end is that it 's every man for himself . 
But look , you 're free . 
The world is your oyster , which you with sword may open , eh ? 
Yeah , grasp it . 
The world is a big place , there 's lots to see and do , so best get cracking , eh ? 
Chop , chop . 
Ah ! - I hear congratulations are in order . 
You got what you wanted . The land , the property , the title . 
You 're a rich man , Blancheford . And such a simple solution . 
Hmm ? One that was there all along , just waiting to be grasped , please . 
And it sounds like you got away with it beautifully since they 're all blaming this , um , this woman , this Nelly Jackson . Yes . - Well done . 
- I got a note to come and find you . 
- When 's the funeral ? - Tomorrow . 
I 'll be there . 
You didn 't know my father . 
Funerals aren 't for the dead , Thomas . 
I 'll be there to support you and your sister . 
- In your hour of darkness . 
- You don 't know my sister . 
I saw her presented at court . A number of years ago . Before she married Lord Wilmot , poor fellow . 
Poor girl , still in mourning for her husband , and now she 's lost her father . 
The funeral procession leaves the house at seven . 
But look , there 's really no need for you - - I 'd like to . 
You see . People like you are rare , Thomas . 
I wasn 't sure you had it in you . 
I wasn 't sure you weren 't just some spoiled little boy . But now ... oh , now I 'm intrigued . 
I feel a certain responsibility for what happened . But I do wonder what else you 're capable of ? 
I do wonder if you 're not cut out for great things . 
What things ? 
There 'll be a time for that . 
I just wanted to find out when the funeral was , and I wanted to see you . 
I have matters to attend to . I 'll see you at church . 
Benning will show you out . 
He needs to make his mark on the world , and Rasselas can 't do that if he 's tiddling about with us , can he ? 
No . He needs to do what he can with his life while he has an opportunity . 
But I liked him . 
- I liked him . 
- I liked him . 
Yeah , but I mean ... you know , I liked him . 
Yeah , well , that kinda mush is a luxury we can 't afford right now , and it 'd be nothing but an inconvenience , and chances are , you know . These things . It 's not often both sides feel the same way , I don 't wanna see you with your heart broke . He did . He did like me . He told me so . 
Did he indeed ? 
That 's mighty inappropriate , he should 've kept it to himself . 
Also , I suspect he 's probably about eight ... - 10 years older than you . - Well , three . 
- Three years older than me , that 's all . 
- And some . - You aren 't my mother ! 
- And some ! No , nor would I wish to be , I 've never seen anyone move so fast ! 
So when have you been having all these in-depth conversations then ? 
Here and there and along the way . 
Oh . And , and his father was ... is the King of Benin . 
Oh , really ? 
Yeah , that 's likely . 
He probably says that guff to all the silly 16-year-olds with nothing but bits of fluff between their ears . 
So , why did he come knocking on our door telling us what he heard - going on up the hall then ? 
- I don 't know . Why would he risk life and limb doing that if he didn 't care about people , eh ? 
He said he 'd seen me around the village and always thought I was like - - 
An English rose . 
So , what then , have you been kissing and that then ? - No . - Yeah , right . - Who 's been kissing ? - We have been talking ! - She and Rasselas . - No one . No one 's been doing nothing , but listening to people 's life stories . - I don 't know . 
- And this is what I was saying . Right , he was bought at London Docks ... 
Age three for fifteen pounds , eight shillings and sixpence , by Lord Blancheford , who took me back to Tottenham on his horse . 
And it was thundering and lightning , and Lord Blancheford put me under his cloak to keep me warm . And I was washed and dressed and given to Sofia and that pig Thomas as a play-thing . 
On account of , they just lost their mother , and Lord Blancheford thought he would cheer them up . 
- So he was fed ... And clothed and petted and treated like one of the family until one day ... When Rasselas got to being about 9 or 11 , that 's when ... Thomas got sent to Eton or some such , and I got put to work in the farmyard . 
Miss Sofia and Rasselas , they cried and cried , but ... That was it , that was when everything changed , and ... Stand and deliver ! 
- Get out ! - George , come on . Nell , what 's going on ? 
- I said get out ! 
- Nell , what 's happening ? 
There ain 't no one in here , governor . 
- Just a bunch of people 's clothes . 
I know you . 
You do . So , why not go pester someone else before I part your hair for you like I did the last time ? 
And who are these two beauties ? 
It 's that fella , Nelly ? 
It 's that posh fella from London . 
What 's that poor little mite trying to say ? 
It 's us , Mr. Devereux . 
Why you dressed up so cunningly like a highwayman ? 
What she 's trying to say is , I met this fella . The other day in London . Who you 'll never believe has a remarkable resemblance to you . 
Anyone with eyes might think you was twins . 
And , you know , he even had a scar , which I coulda swore blind I 'd given you , him , myself . 
Curious . 
How came you by this handsome carriage and these four horses ? I was obliged to borrow them . 
- Do you know what I think ? 
I think you 're Nelly Jackson . 
Nelly Jackson , who has a 20-pound reward on her head for murder . 
Took me best part of 18 months to get a 20-pound reward on my head . and this one does it overnight ! It 's all over London . 
This time tomorrow , it 'll be up , down , and sideways across the country . 
- Twenty pounds ? 
- How about , governor ? We take this horse here , and them four horses . And the carriage . And these two trollops . And we turn the gobby one in , and get the 20 pounds ? 
Have you learned nothing from the last time I duffed you all up ? 
Go . 
He 's new . 
Makes sense . 
Go on then . 
- Aha , ha ! - Drop the pistol . - Rasselas ! 
What do you want me to do with this one , Nelly ? 
- What you doing here ? 
- I saved you ! 
Sorry , you saved me ? 
What are you on about you " saved me " ? 
And Roxy . And George . 
- Have you been following us ? 
- So , I was going to go my own way . Like you suggested . 
But first off , I 'll be honest with you , boss , I felt sad , then I got to feeling lonely , and then I came over all worried about you three , and ... So , what shall I do with this one ? 
I don 't know . 
It kinda depends on whatever drivel comes out of his bunghole next . 
Yeah , well , obviously , I couldn 't admit to being Charles Devereux in front of the academicians . Could I ? 
So , what happened then ? 
You went back and totted the scum that murdered your poor old dad , did you ? 
No . I never . 
- But that 's what everyone thinks . - Mm . So , here 's an idea . You 're going to get caught , and I don 't know what your plan is , but based on the fact that we 're standing here in broad daylight and having this conversation at all leaves me assuming it 's a bad one . 
I hope you 're not planning on dropping the little ones off with a favorite uncle , Nell . 
Surely not that old chestnut . 
Well , and what even if I was ? 
Which I ain 't . Because that 'll be the first place they 'll look . 
If you have a second cousin 10 times removed , who you never once kept eyes on living in Kent . They will be outside his house this time tomorrow , believe you me , 20 pounds is a lot of dust . 
So , do you wish to hear my idea ? 
- Can do . 
- You and me should team up , Nelly Jackson . 
- No . - I can help you . 
Doubt it . 
So , like I say . This time tomorrow , all the news sheets up and down the country will have your description printed all over them . And not just yours . Hers and hers and his . 
There won 't be one safe place you can hide . 
So , what do you do , eh ? 
Where do you go ? When there 's nowhere to go ? 
Did you nab any lolly when you borrowed this bone shaker ? 
Few quid , maybe . 
Right , well , let 's you and me pretend to be Lord and Lady So-and-So , and hire a good set of rooms in a nice hotel in an indifferent little town for a few days . 
You 've got the clothes for it , - let 's use them . 
- What are you on about ? I 'm on about hiding in plain sight , Nelly Jackson . 
Which amounts to no hiding at all . Just changing who you appear to be . 
And what about us ? 
Well , her Ladyship must have a lady 's maid . 
And perhaps her Ladyship is traveling with her eccentric little cousin . and of course , Lord So-and-So must have a fine footman . Yeah , or you could be my footman . 
Just think , hot food , ugh . Warm beds , clean clothes , roof over your heads . 
Why ? 
Why would you do that ? What 's in it for you ? 
I like an adventure . 
They 're all looking at me . 
No , they 're not . 
I am the resurrection and the life , sayeth the Lord . 
He who believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live . 
And whoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . 
I know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth . 
No worms destroy this body ... - Thomas . 
- Through my flesh shall I see God . 
Just carry on . 
- Whom I shall see for myself , and mine I shall behold . 
We brought nothing into this world , and it is certain , we can carry nothing out . 
Blessed be the name of the Lord . 
Amen . 
Amen . 
Lord and Lady Shankley . 
Yes , that 's us . 
How remarkably hideous . 
- Is that a woman ? 
- Of course , it is . 
Bathsheba . Children should be seen , but not heard . 
Doesn 't her countenance send chills down your spine ? 
Oh , on the contrary . It 's the other that unnerves me . 
See how one of his eyes is so much smaller than the other ? 
Yes , ma 'am . Rather grotesque . 
Well , I don 't see that . - She 's rather ratty . - Hmm . 
Do you think he looks a bit smelly from the left ? 
Oh , yeah . 
Guarantee you that 's the first time she 's been wanted . 
Very good . No , honestly I just want to punch him in the face . 
Oh , to be a highwaywoman . 
Do you think , you know , like , she 's rather beautiful ? - Rather a hag . - Stupid hat . 
Face like a weasel . 
Do you think his nose looks like a , a dog 's tallywhacker ? 
Do you agree ? 
What do you think ? 
Both as vile as each other , sir . Our rooms ? 
This way , Lord Shankley . 
Luggage , Jacques ! 
Onwards ! 
Jacques . 
Excuse me , gentlemen . 
Excuse me , my good man , where might I find the lady of the house ? 
Through here , sir . 
Yes . 
Lady Wilmot . 
- May I offer my condolences . 
I 'm Robert Hennessey . Earl of Poynton . 
I didn 't know my father knew anyone on the Queen 's Privy Council . 
Oh , he didn 't . Well , not me at least . 
Some time ago , your father sent your brother up to London , to your Uncle James Ogilvy , your late mother 's - - - Yes , to see if he could , uh ... do anything with Thomas . 
I rather famously had something of a misspent youth myself . I suppose Ogilvy thought I could be some sort of guide . - Or mentor to Thomas . 
- I didn 't know that . How kind of you . 
Ah , I 've interrupted you . 
I 'm trying to familiarize myself with estate matters . 
Thomas won 't do it . But I shan 't let it go to rack and ruin . 
If there is anything I can do to be of use to you , please ask . 
The only way anyone can be of any use to me is in helping to bring to justice the mindless , depraved , non-entity that murdered my father . 
Uh , Nell Jackson ? 
Ma 'am . Mr. Jarrold 's here . 
He says he 's aware it might not be the right moment , but - - 
Show him in . 
I 've taken on this man , Jarrold , to track her down . 
Apparently , he 's very good . But ... I think it 's going to take more than mere mortals to capture her . 
Has Thomas told you ? 
She fights as though ... she 's possessed by a demon . 
And you saw this ? You saw her kill your father ? 
Yes . She shot him . Right in front of us . 
The cook and some of the men ran in when Thomas shouted and it ... It was extraordinary . The way she stopped bullets with her bare hands . 
Have you ... heard of such a thing ? 
There are more things in this world than most people ever begin to imagine . 
- Really ? 
- Yes . 
It sounds to me as if this Nell Jackson may have , whether she 's aware of it or not , accessed some spirit . Some entity . 
And if she has , like must be fought with like , because as you 've observed , no mortal will touch her . 
Can you help us ? 
Possibly . 
Lady Wilmot . 
- Ah , shall I - - - No . Stay . Would you ? 
I 'll be brief . 
This morning , we had news of a carriage held up by a woman just south of Potters Bar . 
And from her appearance and the extraordinary way she conducted herself , it was her . 
There will be other sightings , and as soon as there are , the net will tighten . 
Was she alone ? 
And the guard and the driver were both heavily armed . 
Both former soldiers . 
Place more adverts in more news sheets . And raise the reward to 40 pounds . 
Very good . 
- Good , that 's very good . 
- Oh , Lady Shankley , look . 
Yeah . 
Oh , I could 've been in Bristol now . I could 've been on a ship . 
Well , you see , the thing is , even then , I shouldn 't feel obliged to run off . 
I should be able to find a magistrate who will listen to the truth . 
Won 't happen . 
The law is made by the toffs , for the toffs . - the truth is either irrelevant ... - Yeah , right . ... or whatever they want it to be . 
But it shouldn 't be . 
But that 's just how they all think , tiddler . 
You won 't find one that doesn 't . 
Why do you live like this ? If you 're a toff in real life ? 
You assume I have a choice . I have no money . 
No . It 's true . 
My old man liked the gambling tables too much . Left me next to nothing . 
Just the title and my address in Mayfair , which I 'm very fond of . Except it 's full of tenants . I just have two rooms in the attic . 
But , so what ? 
It 's an address in Mayfair . 
That 's all that matters . 
If people can have confidence in you , in who you say you are , well , it makes ' em feel comfortable . Then you can get away with almost anything . 
Brilliant . 
Nelly didn 't believe me when I said your dad was the King of Benin . 
I don 't believe it myself most days . 
- Don 't you feel cheated ? 
And my name too . 
Rasselas isn 't my real name . Lord Blancheford gave it to me . 
My real name 's lost . Like my family . 
Ain 't you ever tempted to go back there and find them ? 
I would . More than anything . But how ? 
I wouldn 't know where to start even if I saved up for the passage . And chances are , with everything that 's happened , if I went anywhere near the docks , someone 'd just clapped me in irons and I could end up sent to the colonies . 
There must be a way . 
Jacques ? 
A note come for your governor . 
- And I 'm one , two ... Go on then . 
Thank you , footman . 
I 'm not your footman , you jumped-up pickpocket . 
I am pretending to be your footman . 
Why ? ' Tis an invitation to Lord and Lady Shankley to go playing cards tomorrow afternoon over at Widdicombe Manor with Lord and Lady Springbourne . Who 's that ? We met him in church , yesterday . We were talking to him . 
Well , I was . 
I said we were just passing through on our way up to London , and well , they 've gone and done the civil thing and invited us to drink tea with them and play cards . 
Well , you must write back and say we can 't go . Why ? 
Because as soon as I open my cake hole , they 'll probably gonna smoke the fact that I don 't know one end of a fork from the other . Nelly . You are such a disappointment . We can fleece them at the card table . - I can 't . 
- I can ! 
We 'll be quids in and it 'll be a riot . 
You were surprisingly convincing as Lady Shankley when we arrived , Nelly . 
George is right . You do have a natural ... something or other about you . I brought this as well , just in case there was anything about you in it . 
Think of it like this . The more you practice pretending to be other than you are , the better you 're going to get at it . 
Plus , Nelly , this Lord Springbourne , he might be a magistrate . 
You can fathom what sort of cove he is , and if he seems like the sort that might listen - - - What time are they expecting us ? 
- Four o 'clock . Listen to this . 
" The villain who held up and stole a carriage outside Potters Bar three days ago is believed to be none other than the same Nelly Jackson , who committed the foul murder of Lord Blancheford . " 
Why do they call me Nelly ? 
" If it was , it might be assumed that the fiend ... " Is that you ? " - Yeah , it is . - " ... is heading north . " Ha ! Well , they 've got that wrong . If everyone thinks we 're heading north . We might be all right here in Slough for a good week . 
" The reward for information leading to the capture of Jackson has been raised to 40 pounds . " 
Poynton . Poynton . 
This Nell Jackson , have you been keeping up ? 
By all accounts , she 's something of the supernatural about her . 
Does she ? 
See , I thought , rather , your area of expertise . 
I , I wondered if she might be useful to the cause , perhaps . 
I 'd hope that would be for me to decide . 
Yes , of course , of course . 
My governor thought there was something fishy about them as soon as they turned up . Well , soon as her Ladyship starts opening her chops and trying to talk like a toff . 
They said they were from Thunderbridge Hall in Totnes , but Mrs. Blewitt , who works down in the kitchens , she hails from down that way , and she says she ain 't never heard of no Thunderbridge Hall . Nor of any Lord and Lady Shankley neither . 
I 've no idea who this Lord Shankley might be . But the description of the four others fits perfectly , including your runaway , Rasselas . 
The boy saw a note inviting them to tea this afternoon at a Lord Springbourne 's house . 
Well , what are you waiting for ? 
You better set off now if you want to catch them there . 
Come on , lad . 
Um , will I get some of the reward , mister ? 
How can I contact your friend , the Earl of Poynton ? 
Why ? 
Because we have to look like we 're doing everything we can to hunt Nell Jackson down because of the idiotic mess you 've got us into . - Yes , but - - - If you 're hanged for murder , the estate will go to our cousin in Northumberland . 
And he 'll move in with his family , and I 'll be dependent on him for every crumb . 
So , be strong . 
Resolute . 
For my sake . I can only help you if you help me . 
Mr. Jarrold ! 
I need to write a note quickly to the Earl of Poynton , but then I would like very much to come with you and your men to Slough . 
Get ready . 
Come on . 
Come on . 
How long have we been married ? 
- Six months . 
- Six months , three weeks , three days . 
The devil 's in the detail . What 's my favorite food ? 
- Jellied eels ? Custard ? 
- Candied apple . Quince . Plum . And gourd . And spiced dainties from silken Samarkand . 
Seriously , you think I 'm gonna remember all of that ? 
I have every faith in you , Lady Shankley . 
From the top , please , my dear . 
A letter for you , sir . 
It isn 't all bad being on the run . 
I don 't miss working in that hot sweaty laundry all day . 
I wonder how Nelly got to fighting like that ? 
Do you think it is Captain Jackson , looking after her from beyond ? 
It 's something . 
I 've seen it . 
How ? 
I don 't know . 
Oh ? What 's it look like ? 
- I don 't know . 
- Well , what 've you seen ? Well , it 's like ... An aura . And it 's good . Well , it feels good . 
And I don 't know that Captain Jackson was any good . 
Isn 't that , Lady Wilmot ? 
- They must know we 're here . - How ? They 're not stopping . 
They must know Nell is gone to Widdicombe Manor ! 
How ? 
There 's too many of them ! 
Pocket diver . 
- What 's my favorite color ? 
- Sort of brown , eh , sort of dung color ? Aquamarine . 
I 'm thinking this is a mistake , Nelly Jackson . 
Chin up , don 't look at the floor . Look people in the eyes and smile . 
I 'm not sure we should be doing this . 
Nonsense . If in doubt just gaze at me . Like you 're in love with me and I 'll think of something . I 'm telling you , Nelly . Something weird this way comes . 
Ah ! Good afternoon . And what a splendid afternoon it is .
