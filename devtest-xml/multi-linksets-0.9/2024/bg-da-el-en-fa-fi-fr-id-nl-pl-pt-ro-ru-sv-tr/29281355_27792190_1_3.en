Does anyone know why there 's a luxury limousine parked outside ? 
RUBY Give me one minute . 
I 've always been fascinated by the concept of camouflage in biology . 
Camouflage so good that hunters miss their prey because they blend into their surroundings . 
But camouflage only works as long as the other doesn 't know what to look for . 
And as long as you don 't want to be found . 
We 'll be back by 8 : 00 , Mrs. Bell . Yes . 
- Hey . - Hey , honey . You never mentioned a trip to London . 
It 's for the committee . The gala poster goes to print tomorrow . 
- Well then , best of luck . - Thanks . 
Ruby . - If there 's anything , call me . - Mom . 
- See you later . - Have fun . 
Yes . 
Dresses from the Victorian Era . Yes . 
It 's the theme of the gala . 
That is perfect . Exactly . 
Ma 'am . 
We won 't need long . 
Exactly . Okay . Thank you . Bye . 
Hi . 
Thanks for picking me up . 
Why the change of mind ? 
It 's no big deal . We 'll go , take pictures of the dress , and leave . 
Is it true that you make suits for King Charles ? 
Yes . 
Maybe we 'll meet him today . Then you have to curtsy . 
Don 't believe everything you 're told . 
Then it 's not true that you eat caviar , bathe in champagne and destroy waterbeds during sex ? 
Don 't pretend you don 't know what they say about you . 
I lost a bottle of bubbly in the pool once and went swimming . Accidentally . 
I find caviar disgusting . 
As for the third point , it wasn 't a waterbed . 
How boring . 
Want to hear something really boring ? 
- There 's not a single rumor about you . - That 's no accident . 
I prefer to be invisible . 
Tell me something about yourself . Something none of our classmates knows . 
No one in my family has gone to college . 
We couldn 't believe I got a scholarship to Maxton Hall . 
Suddenly , Oxford was within reach . 
I can hardly wait to be there , take courses by Nobel laureates , read everything in the Bodleian Library , discuss Hobbes and Nietzsche . 
Sorry . 
Ready ? 
Finish it and send it off . 
Sir . 
- You must be Miss Bell . - Hi . Welcome . I 'm Tristan , the master tailor here . 
Please follow me . 
Two . 
This is the showroom for the Beaufort collection , which dates back to 1848 . 
We 've prepared a few dresses for you . 
I recognize this . 
It was shown last year in the Victoria and Albert Museum . 
Absolutely right . 
For the Queen Victoria retrospective . 
My sister made me go twice . She is fashion-obsessed . 
These are all just reproductions . 
The originals are too delicate to be made accessible to the public . 
So , does it help ? 
It 's perfect . 
Can I take a picture ? Please . 
RUBY @ Kieran : 
Would this be good for a poster ? 
KIERAN - You 're amazing , Ruby ! I 'll start right away . 
JESSALYN How did you pull this off ? 
CAMILLE Are you at the Beaufort collection ? 
JESSALYN You as in ? 
Want to try it on ? 
- Yes , sure . - Why not ? 
It probably costs more than my parents earn in a year . 
I think I 'll keep my distance . 
I 'm sure it 's complicated with all the buttons and ... 
But you like it . Try it on . When will you get another chance ? 
If you follow suit . 
Tristan , can you take a picture ? Her family will want to see . 
No , that 's ... 
Here you are . 
May I ask who this is ? 
I 'm Ruby Bell , sir . 
I work with your son on the event committee . 
Pleasure to meet you . 
You look fantastic . 
He 's playing dress-up while we await him at lunch with the Ellingtons . 
I understand that you 're in your rebellious phase , but it 's inappropriate to drag this poor girl into it . 
Sorry for the ambush , but I 'm afraid James has allowed himself too much latitude in his scheduling . 
The dress is , if I may say so , a bit tight around the breast . 
- Tristan ... - He has better things to do . 
James could put the photos on social media . Like a retrospective before the launch of the new collection . 
I 'm not sure if this is the image . Beaufort wants to project . 
No offense , but that is the dress of a queen . 
I 'll go change . 
... his daughter wanted to wait for you . 
Percy is waiting downstairs . 
Thank you for the unforgettable experience . 
Give my regards to King Charles . 
I 'll take the train . 
LIN Well , how 's it going with James ? 
Maxton Hall THE WORLD BETWEEN US . 
BASED ON THE NOVEL " SAVE ME " BY MONA KASTEN 
- Hey . - You didn 't even try . 
- You have to throw it right . - I am throwing it right . 
Ember . 
- So , the garden ? - I don 't have time . I have homework . 
You never came out of your room yesterday , sweetie . 
How was London ? 
Is everything okay ? 
Sure . 
I have to go . Later . 
- Bye . - See you later . 
Interesting design , Miss Bell . 
I didn 't expect that Mr. Beaufort and you would take charge of the design . 
At least no one can say you didn 't give it your all . 
- What do you think , Mr. Sutton ? - Yes . 
Good work . Really . 
Thank you . 
- There she is . - Never seen before . Is she new ? 
I heard her mother works in a bakery . 
Hey , Ruby . 
I just wanted to say the posters are really cool . But it would have been nice to know you were doing them . 
- I spent all weekend on the pictures ... - I 'm sorry . 
- ... in Photoshop . - I didn 't know anything . 
Do you have a second ? 
- Are you completely crazy ? 
- What ? 
Do you think London wasn 't humiliating enough for me ? 
You look great in the picture . 
I try not to stand out , and you plaster my face all over school ? 
You needed posters , and I ... 
We should go back to how things were before . 
Before ? 
When you didn 't know I existed . 
I was definitely better off . 
Everything okay ? 
He threw me out of the showroom , in front of his parents . 
What ? Why ? 
He was ashamed of me . 
His father looked at me as if I was dirt on his shoe . 
Seriously ? 
You look like a fucking queen in that picture . 
You mustn 't let them treat you like that . Not them . 
He was just honest . 
You wouldn 't talk to me either , if your father hadn 't lost everything . 
Nice that you have a low opinion of me . 
Good morning . 
Today we will simulate a typical interview situation , as you will experience at Oxford . 
Had a quickie with James ? 
Please take out yesterday 's questionnaires . 
Let 's start with you , Miss Bell . 
Not everyone likes to be the center of attention , but staying cool under pressure can be learned . 
So , Miss Bell , why do you think you would be the perfect candidate for Saint Hilda 's College at Oxford ? 
Saint Hilda 's was ... 
Saint Hilda 's was the last women 's college established at Oxford . And the ideals of inclusivity and equality ... 
Boring . 
Tell us what happened with James . 
If you can 't behave , you can leave my classroom . 
- Understood ? - Yes . Understood . 
Miss Bell , I asked you why they should accept you . Not about the benefits of Saint Hilda 's . 
Saint Hilda 's is different from the ... is different from the old elite colleges . 
That 's why I think I would fit in there . 
Hear that ? She 's different . 
You 're a nobody , from a no-name backwater . 
My name is Ruby . 
That is the dress of a queen . Are you completely crazy ? 
And that 's why no one will be interested in you . 
Interesting design , Miss Bell . 
- No letter of recommendation . 
- I try not to stand out . You plaster my face all over school ? 
We should go back to before . 
So , Cyril , does your big mouth work up here too ? 
I 'm glad you 're here . I 'm such a klutz . 
I dropped the whole platter . 
- I have to throw the cream puffs out . - Oh , come on . 
There 's a five-second rule . 
They 've been there for at least 10 . 
I couldn 't reach them . They were under the counter . 
It 'll be our little secret . 
What 's all this for , anyway ? 
Today is our 20th anniversary . 
I wanted to surprise your mom . 
I could have helped . Why didn 't you say anything ? 
There are some things you have to do yourself . And enchanting your wife is one of them . 
Everything okay ? 
Did you forget your ... 
Hey . 
I was an ass on Saturday . 
I know that . 
It was not because of you . 
- My dad and I ... - You were embarrassed . 
I embarrassed myself . 
I had the posters printed to show you that I 'm not like that . 
Like what ? 
Someone who treats people he likes like dirt . 
- I 'm a laughingstock . - They 're not laughing . 
They want to know the girl . 
And I think they should know . 
You 're much too special to hide yourself from anyone . 
Still , shouldn 't that be my decision ? 
What you said at school today ... 
What if I don 't want to go back ? 
- Cyril 's throwing a team party . - James . Once you get to know them , they 're nice . 
Alistair anyway ... 
London , Maxton Hall , Cyril 's party , that 's your world . 
I don 't fit in and don 't want to . 
I have my own world . It can work if I focus and avoid people like you and Cyril . If I remain invisible . 
Ruby ? 
You 're not invisible anymore . 
Not to me . 
- Hi , sweetie . - Hi . 
Here . This was hanging at the gate . 
- Happy anniversary , my angel . - Oh , wow . Is this icing sugar ? 
They look especially nice . 
This dress was made for you . Just 200 years too early . 
Wear it to the fundraising gala . You look too beautiful in it not to . J.M.B. 
Go to hell , James Beaufort . 
Harold , I 'll send you the invitation to the Young Beaufort event , - along with a copy of the contracts . - Great . 
Thank you for coming . It 's great to have you on board . 
It 's an honor . 
- Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . 
Well done . 
Are you proud ? Young Beaufort is fully financed . 
You worked on this investment . 
I thought I screwed up , because I was playing dress-up and not eating with the Ellingtons . 
I know you think you 're angry at me because I interrupted your little costume party . 
But if you 're honest , you know I actually did you a favor . 
Girls like that can 't keep it up for long , the illusion of being something they 're not . 
How did you keep it up ? 
This company has gone through difficult times . 
It was my hard work alone that enabled your mother and I to straighten it out . 
I gave everything for this family 's reputation . 
As long as you can 't say the same , you can keep your mouth shut . 
Why don 't you give it to Lydia if you 're so unhappy with me ? 
Young Beaufort was her idea . She is more invested , skilled ... 
She wants to believe that . The fact is that Lydia 's weakness for missteps means that she will never be a serious candidate . 
Remember what you owe your mother and this company . 
Okay ? 
And pull yourself together . 
You 've got a lot going on right now . 
I 'm sorry about last class . 
I had a bad day and ... 
I know you have big goals . 
You have to decide if you want to accomplish them . 
You can 't aim high and fly under the radar at the same time . 
Only those who can deal with judgment have a chance of making it to the top . 
Graham ... Mr. Sutton praised you highly . So you really need to go for it . 
Okay ? 
And show me that we can make it through a class period without unleashing chaos . 
No idea . 
She hangs the photos on all the walls like a crazy stalker . 
- Does she think she 's special ? 
- Poor James . 
- Is this about Ruby ? 
- What 's it to you ? 
I know you think this is the real world , but money and respect can be lost , just like this . 
And then you 're all you have left . 
So invest a bit in developing your character and not so much in your next purse . 
Lab partner ? 
I 'm sorry for what I said . I was having a bad day . 
It 's okay . 
I probably wouldn 't have talked to you if my father hadn 't gone bankrupt . 
But I wasn 't a particularly nice person , so I 'm almost grateful to him . 
James invited me to a party . 
Is this guy confused or what ? 
He came to my house to apologize and said - he doesn 't want to return to before . - James . 
James Beaufort said that ? 
Holy shit . 
And ? 
Are you going ? 
You can 't crawl back under your rock . 
The hottest guy at school wants you . 
So , show the idiots who Ruby Bell is . 
Once your reputation is trashed , you can live life unabashed . 
Believe me , I know . 
But I 'm not unabashed . 
I 'm totally abashed . 
Then go there as stuck up and smitten as you are . 
That doesn 't seem to bother James . 
- Maxton ! - Hall ! 
Maybe it 's true . Maybe there is a chasm between my world and that of others . 
Like a no-man 's-land . 
And whoever crosses it , in either direction , is certain to get hurt . 
You need courage to dare and go there . 
To stand up for what you want . 
But nothing is more tiring than the question if it had been a mistake to even try . 
A new , trendy chiropractor from London showed me this . 
It 's the best thing for tension headaches . 
The head of Young Beaufort . I can imagine the pressure . 
My parents are already planning my internships . 
But when it all gets to be too much , I try to remember that it will all be ours one day . 
You will be in charge of everything . 
When its cover is blown , the prey has only two options . 
Fight or flight . 
But the thing is , once you 've been seen , really seen , you might realize you 're not as harmless and helpless as you thought . 
That you have spikes under the camouflage and don 't have to hide in the shadows . 
Ruby . 
Don 't tell me Cyril invited you . 
Actually , it was your brother . 
So that 's the way it is ? 
You must feel pretty powerful . 
You have James wrapped around your finger , and you know about my little dilemma . 
But you know what ? 
You can say whatever you want now . 
There is nothing to tell anymore . 
It 's over . 
For good . 
Thanks to you . 
I 'm sorry , Lydia . 
I don 't need your pity . 
But understand one thing . 
James and I look out for each other . 
If you 're with him , there will be nowhere to hide . 
And if you break his heart , you 're done . 
You came . 
I was thinking . 
I think the past is overrated . 
Thank you for the dress . 
You 're welcome . 
Sorry . 
It 's crowded in here . 
Perfect timing . It was getting hot . 
Let 's get out of here . 
- I 'll grab my jacket . - I 'll wait here . 
Since when do you leave parties before 4 : 00 a.m. ? 
- Since when is that your business ? 
Knock it off . 
Hey , Ruby . 
Leave us our friend , okay ? 
- We 're all friends , right ? 
- Hey , Cyril . No , no no ! 
James ! James ! James ! James ! James ! James ! 
Hey , it 's okay . 
It 's okay . Calm now . Calm now . 
It 's okay . 
Stop it . 
Percy . 
Do we have some warm clothes ? 
I was still little . 
My dad and I went out on a boat . 
My teddy bear fell in the water . 
I tried to get it and lost my balance . 
Dad jumped in after me . I couldn 't swim yet . 
Suddenly there was a boat . 
It 's my fault he 's in a wheelchair . 
Should I circle the block once more , sir ? 
I don 't know what I 'm doing here , Percy .
