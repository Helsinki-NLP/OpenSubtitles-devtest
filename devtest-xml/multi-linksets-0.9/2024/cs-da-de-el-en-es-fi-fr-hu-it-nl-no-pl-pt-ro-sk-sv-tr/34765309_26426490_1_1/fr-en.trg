It has been 500 years ... and the treasure of Lautrec remains the greatest mystery in all of Naples . 
It is buried in the dark Underground of the city ... but no one has ever been able to find it . 
Here are the deeds to the house . 
They 'll be vacant in three days . 
Hold on . 
Where is it ? 
Come on , now ! 
Go , go get him ! 
No , not you . The briefcase ! The briefcase ! 
- Come on , let 's get him ! - Come on ! 
Where 'd he go ? 
Come with me ! 
♪ Jumping from one roof to another People are screaming from down below ♪ ♪ " The Munaciello is back ! " ♪ 
Freeze , you scumbag ! 
Come down here and get me . 
This one 's dead . 
Let 's go . 
- Sasà , you have to make him bald . 
- No . 
- Sasà , I said that he 's bald ! 
- I said no ! 
The last time someone saw him , he had curly hair . Just like this . 
You 're saying he didn 't ? 
- Hey , I told you that he 's bald ! - Seriously ? 
I already told you - - 
- Yeah , now - - - Hey , stop it ! Come on , Gennà , let 's go home . Mom 's waiting for us . 
Guys , come on ! We only have a few days left to spend together . Let 's not waste our time . 
And , Sasà , it 's spelled " Wonderboi " with a W. 
So what ? You still say it like " Uonderboi . " I write how I speak . 
The skateboard has a jaguar on it . 
Now , you 're doing it , too ? 
Wonderboy is not Brazilian like you . 
Stop it . 
- What do you mean ? 
- Guys , watch out ! 
Aniè , where 's your dad heading off to ? 
- I don 't know . 
- Let 's go . We 'll finish the drawing later . 
But when ? 
Did you forget that we have to do the ritual ? 
Let 's go , come on . 
- Yeah , let 's go . - Let 's go . 
- Let 's go , guys . 
- Bye , guys . 
- Bye ! - Bye , guys . See you . 
Hey , Terè , you take this thing , or my mom will kill me . 
Let 's go , come on . 
Wait for me ! 
- Hey guys , have you packed all your stuff ? - Yeah , sure ! 
Oh , yeah , yeah . 
You 're so beautiful , sweetie . 
When you get married , I 'll make one even more radiant than this . 
- And there you go again ! - No ! Stop , stop , don 't move . 
I only basted it . You 're gonna rip the seam . 
Come on , are you really thinking about my wedding and not about where we 're moving to in three days ? 
But that 's why I 'm saying this . 
Dad , for the last time , I told you , nothing 's gonna happen between me and the son of that shop owner in town . 
I 'd rather go to Germany to stay with Mom . That 's all I 'm saying . 
- You 've always said you didn 't wanna go . - Yeah , Dad . That 's a figure of speech . 
... because I want to tell you a secret ! You see all of these beautiful highlights in my hair ? 
You 'd think it 's shatush , but it 's not , actually . 
It 's called " Bala-layage . " Balayage ! It 's called " Balayage . " 
- What , Aniello ? What do you want ? 
- I need to use Dad 's scooter . 
Well , ask your dad then ! 
You 're interrupting my awesome video just for that ? 
It was going so well ! 
Just leave , sweetie . 
What ? 
What do you mean , " What ? " It 's my room , Dad . 
- Can I borrow your scooter ? 
- It 's broken . 
- Raffaele and Gennaro leave tomorrow . 
- Well , safe travels . 
What 's the landlady doing here ? 
It 's nothing . 
Go play with your friends , go . 
Donna Angè , don 't you worry . I 'll take care of it . 
I hope so . 
THE PALACE OF THE SPIRITS Hey , Gennà , the story I just wrote already has 20 comments . 
They 're all desperate girls . 
Listen , listen . " When you 're not home , I 'm too scared to walk past your house . " 
What do you think ? 
" Address in Brescia ? " She wants my address ! 
Hey , nice ! But none of them have ever shown up here . 
So ? You 're not ready yet ? 
Rafè , Gennà , can you please hurry up ? 
Thank God , we 're leaving tomorrow . 
We 're finally getting out of this dirty city . We 're gonna celebrate the best New Year 's Eve of our lives . 
Brescia offers us all the things Naples doesn 't . 
Like a future for you and a stable job for your dad . And we 'll finally leave behind our landlady . She tells us how to live , how much we have to pay her . 
Again with these haunted places in Naples ? 
You won 't need that in Brescia . It 's not haunted . 
- It 's not ? 
- You won 't need it , Gennà . 
Actually , you know what we 'll do ? 
We 'll throw it away . 
- We 'll do what ? - Come on , let 's go ! 
And then we 're gonna finish packing . Right , Mom ? 
- Good , good , good . Come on . 
- Go where ? - Follow me ! 
- Come on , go . 
And grab that big book . 
- Freaking kids . 
I worked so hard to get that scholarship . 
I wanna study archaeology . 
And I want to study in Naples , ' cause the best place to learn about archaeology is Italy . 
I mean , I 'm not just gonna wait for our landlady to kick us out . 
Sasà , where are you going ? 
Please , don 't tell me you guys are gonna do something stupid . 
I 'm just saying goodbye then I 'll be back . 
Anyway , I 'm gonna talk to our landlady . 
Now , I 'm missing this note because - - No , Uncle . 
It 's just that you 're out of tune . 
Try singing it yourself . No . Since Mom 's been gone , you know I don 't want to sing anymore . 
Can you please tell me why you don 't wanna come on that cruise with me ? 
You won 't have to sing . You can just be there with your uncle and tell him when he 's out of tune . 
Please , I don 't wanna talk about this again . 
You know I wanna stay here . 
But where ? Our landlady is kicking us out in three days . 
Uncle , just stop . 
I 'm gonna stay at my cousins ' but I 'm not leaving Naples . 
The figurine . 
Go find that figurine . 
And do it now . 
Donna Angè , the guy 's dead for sure . He threw himself into the deepest well in all of Naples and landed splat on the ground . 
You got ripped off like a sucker . 
You didn 't see the way he can move , the way he can climb walls . 
This guy , he isn 't human . 
People are saying there 's a new Munaciello in Naples . 
Again with that story ? 
The Munaciello is dead . 
You 're the idiot here . If you don 't bring that figurine back to me , I swear , I 'll cut the ears off your head . 
Got it . 
Hurry . 
Spirit whose help I seek ... I bring you these earrings . They were a gift from my First Communion . 
Now , they 're yours . 
Have pity on me . You know what I want . 
Let me see Mom again . 
Anyway , I hope you like the earrings . 
I have to go now . I 'm gonna say goodbye to my friends . 
But tomorrow , I 'll be back with another gift , okay ? 
Guys , you 'll never guess what I just found out ! I 'm coming , but ... 
Oh , my gosh ! Shoot ! Dang it ! 
Let 's go , guys . 
Guys , you 'll never guess what I just found out ! I 'm coming , but ... 
Okay , let 's wait for him down there . 
He knows where to meet us anyway . 
The weirdo 's over there . 
Quiet . 
- Let 's go . 
- We wanted to go swimming . 
- Swimming ? 
In December ? 
You were heading to The Palace of the Spirits , am I right ? 
It 's the most dangerous place in Naples . 
- Stay away from there ! 
- Run , you guys ! 
Aniello isn 't here yet . 
We all have to be here . 
His phone 's not on . But he 's gonna be all right anyway . 
So what ? He 's still our friend . 
Terè , we have to get started . 
Come on , Gennà . 
In the name of the Siren , who has always protected us , we 'll make a pact that binds us forever . 
We entrust to you , Siren Parthenope , the book we 've been writing for all these joyful years . 
Now , let 's hold hands . 
In exactly five years , when all of us will be of age , we 'll find ourselves here exploring all the secrets of our beloved city , the proud home to over 5,000 years of history . 
To us and to Naples ' secrets , guys ! 
Always together ! 
Wait ! 
Wonderboy ! I have proof he 's real ! 
He stole a figurine from the landlady . She 's obsessed with it . 
And she made a huge deal about my dad having to find it ! 
That 's why he was in a rush this morning ! 
He vanished into the Underground with that figurine ! 
- Why should we care about that ? 
- Why should we care ? 
The landlady wants the figurine back ! If we find it , we can blackmail her ! 
And you won 't have to move out ! 
Your houses in exchange for the figurine ! 
Hey , Aniè , just calm down . 
Well , how do we find this figurine ? 
- Yeah . - It 's in the Underground ! 
We 've been drawing those maps for five years . Right , Gennà ? 
Yes , Aniè , but the Underground , its passages are over 250 miles long . And we 've only explored a few miles . 
Plus , the landlady won 't just let four brats like us blackmail her . 
- Right . 
- Haven 't you noticed how she treats us ? 
She hates kids . 
Seriously ? 
You 're the only friends I have that really care about me . 
Why are you backing down ? 
Come on , Aniè . Don 't make things harder than they already are . 
You know what ? Do what you want . I 'm just gonna go alone then . 
I 'll go through Gaiola . 
- No . - Aniello , stop . 
- Aniello . - Aniello , where you going ? 
Aniello ! Aniello ! 
Oh , my goodness . Aniello ! Aniè ! 
- Aniè , stop ! 
- Little brats ! 
There you are . I knew you were out here being stupid . 
We 're supposed to be leaving soon . 
- Home , now . - Mom , wait . Before - - 
- Shut it ! 
- You have to go pack ! 
What 's he doing now ? 
You 're at it again ? 
Come on , go home ! Hurry up . Let 's go ! 
You didn 't know ? What ? I didn 't hear anything . Really ? You didn 't see Enzo , the junk dealer ? He just went up . 
Are you serious ? 
Yeah , ' cause the trade-off yesterday , 
- it didn 't go down , you know ? - Well , that 's bad , then . 
Yeah , I know . Guess we 'll see how it goes . 
What do you want ? 
Since you didn 't get me the figurine , you don 't get my houses . 
You made some kind of deal with that thief ? 
You 're such an idiot . 
You , on the other hand , must have been talking with someone ! 
Me ? 
You 're a real idiot . 
- What are you saying ? 
- Get him out of here . 
Hey , let me go . What are you doing ? Get your hands off me ! 
- Shut up ! 
- Nobody can mess with me ! 
A deal 's a deal ! 
I get you the figurine , you get me those houses . Understood ? 
Just go , you idiot . 
We 're not done yet . 
What 's going on with our houses ? 
What do you want ? Who are you ? 
I 'm ticked off here ! 
We 're not done yet ! 
Sasà , let 's try here . 
Chihuahua , good morning . 
We 're looking for Aniello . 
We need to know where he is . Because something has happened . 
If only you knew what I 've been through . 
Anyway , Aniello 's not here . 
You can go find him , though . 
Go on and play . 
Come on ! 
It 's us . Open up . 
- Aniello 's not home . 
- Man . 
I just know that he went to the Underground to look for Wonderboy . 
What if we call the police ? 
- So , you 're becoming a northerner already ? 
- Then let 's go tell his mom ! 
You seen how little they care about him ? 
Let 's go ourselves , then ! 
Are you nuts ? 
Alone ? 
Guys , what if we ask that weirdo to help us ? Clemente ! 
He knows every inch of the Naples Underground . 
He 's out of his mind , too . 
No , guys , Sasà is right . It 's our only chance . 
Aniello threw himself off of that cliff for us . We have to save him . 
- Rafè ! Gennà ! 
- Come with me . 
- All done with your packing ? 
- Almost , Mom ! 
Let 's go . 
What 's the plan , Rafè ? 
Guys , pack your backpacks . We 'll meet at the usual place . 
Who are you ? 
How did you get here ? 
I got lost . I jumped into the sea and ended up here ! 
- From where ? 
- From The Palace of the Spirits . 
The Palace of the Spirits , and you ended up here ? 
- But why ? 
- Will you save me or what ? 
- Help me ! 
- You have to stay still ! 
What are you doing ? Where are you going ? 
Oh , my gosh . 
So , you 're ... 
Hey , listen , you can tell me ! 
You 're the new Munaciello of Naples , who steals from the rich and gives to the poor ! 
- Yeah , I 'm Robin Hood . 
- No ! 
You 're even better than Robin Hood ! 
You 're Wonderboy . 
I 'm Tonino . 
We 're closed . 
You 're my new landlord , aren 't you ? 
What do you want from me ? - Are you stalking me ? 
- Why did you go see our landlady ? 
And why do you have to get her a figurine ? What is the deal with that ? 
It 's nothing . Doesn 't matter . 
Some guy on a skateboard raced past me and stole it . 
Which guy ? 
Listen , I told you we 're closed . You wanna scram ? 
Beat it . 
Beat it ! 
One hundred and twenty-one steps . 
Yeah , but we saw a lot of amazing things down there . 
- Yeah . 
- And all these steps are worth it . 
- Right , Maltè ? 
- Of course . Even if there were 150 . 
You see , the thing is that , now I 'm super curious . 
I wanna learn a bit more about these stories you were telling us about . 
Yeah , I know . It 's an amazing world down there . 
In fact , we have some books here that you can - - 
Not a fan of reading , you know ? 
- Well , we have DVDs , too . 
- Not a fan of DVDs either . 
Then how can I help you ? 
I want you to tell me about these urban legends in person . 
Hey , get your hands off me . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , leave me alone ! 
Doctor , Doctor , it 's time for you to tell us a nice , little fairy tale . 
What ? 
I 'm bigger than you . 
Hey ! Let me breathe . 
I need to concentrate to find the right way . 
The way out , you mean ? 
Listen , let 's be clear . I don 't know how I ended up down here . 
Now , I 'm gonna find a way out , then you 'll be on your way ... and I 'll be on mine . 
Got it ? 
What ? 
I 'm just curious . Your skateboard 's customized , right ? 
Should 've left you up there . 
- How do you keep escaping everyone ? 
- " Everyone , " who ? 
What do you mean , " Everyone , who ? " You 're a superhero ! 
You 're the new Munaciello of Naples ! 
Can you swim ? 
I 'm a level eight swimmer . 
Level eight ? Then you 're about to be level nine . 
Hey , Sasà , where are you going dressed like that ? 
- Just taking a walk . - This late ? 
Yeah . 
What do you need that skateboard for ? - Doesn 't matter ! 
- Show me what you have in there ! 
Sasà , did you and your friends steal the figurine ? 
- Sasà . Sasà ! 
Hey , Enzo . 
- You thought you could trick me ? - Me ? 
Never . 
What do you mean ? 
You 're the only one who knew about the figurine . 
And you asked that guy on the skateboard to steal the figurine - and the houses , too ? 
- What are you talking about , Enzo ? 
That little schmuck threw himself down the well outside Palazzo Spinelli . And he smashed into the ground along with the figurine . 
Your plan has failed . 
What plan are you talking about , Enzo ? 
Can 't you see I 'm in a mess here ? 
You know what we 'll do ? 
Tomorrow , you 're gonna go and get that figurine . 
Because if you don 't , I 'm gonna mess you up even more . 
Got it ? 
All right , Enzo . All right . 
What do you want ? 
Our friend jumped into the sea and we can 't find him . 
- You 're the only one who can help us ! 
- We 're sure he 's still alive . 
He ran into the Underground to look for Wonderboy . That guy stole a figurine from our landlady . 
Who 's he looking for ? 
Wonderboy . 
He 's kind of like Munaciello . 
Why would he care about the Munaciello ? 
- I was just explaining . 
- The Munaciello has always been real . 
It 's the people ... who 've forgotten that the city is magical . 
But now , we have to face him . 
How do you get down there ? 
It 'll be anything but simple . 
Follow me . 
The only way in ... is through Gaiola . 
The most haunted place in all of Naples . 
Of course . Just head to that haunted island . 
Rafè , we have to find our friend . Now , hush . 
Actually , I 'd rather talk . If I don 't , I 'll get nervous . 
Look at it . Who knows how many ghosts are there ? 
What 's that ? It 's moving ! It 's moving on its own ! 
Guys , I 'm the one pulling it in . 
- Hop on . 
- He 's totally out of his mind . 
Come on , let 's go . 
Sasà ! 
It 's you . 
Sasà hasn 't come back yet . He left his phone in his room . 
Well , he 's probably with his friends . 
Antò , where are you going ? 
What 's going on here ? 
Francè , sorry , it 's late . Are Gennaro and Raffaele home ? 
Yeah , they 're sleeping . 
We 're leaving for Brescia in the morning . 
- Where 's the landlady going ? 
- Antò , what do you want ? 
Oscar ! Oscar ! 
Antò , can you please tell me what 's going on ? 
I need to borrow your scooter . I 'm following the landlady . 
You really want to go down there this way ? 
It 's completely uncharted territory . 
Let 's just kill him , then . 
- Good idea . Let 's kill him . - No ! No , no , no ! Wait , wait . 
There 's supposed to be another way to get in . 
It 's just that no one 's actually been through there . 
Now , he 's got some manners . 
- Some parts of it have collapsed . 
- Where is it ? 
At Gaiola . 
You 're nuts . 
That Gaiola place is haunted . 
That 's why you should just give up . 
- Hey , Gennà , there 's no signal here . 
- What 'd you expect underground ? 
I think I can see a ladder . 
Wow , guys ! It really is just like Clemente said . 
Yeah , but let 's hope he was wrong about the rest . 
Keep going . 
Gennà ! 
My gosh , I hate this place . 
What happened ? 
It 's nothing , Rafè . Just the wind . 
This one is Sasà 's . 
Let 's hurry . 
Alfrè ! 
Angelica ! 
Yeah ! Angè ! 
Angè , inside this figurine , there is a treasure map . 
Well , long time no see . 
Still looking for that figurine ? 
After everything that 's happened , you still haven 't had enough ? 
How could I have enough if it 's not over yet ? 
Do you know what the landlady 's looking for ? 
A freaking figurine . But I don 't know why . 
And I 'm sure the kids have something to do with it . 
A Gorgon . 
- Terè ? 
- Look at this place . Let 's just go ! 
We have to find him . 
Rafè , don 't be stupid . 
We 'll meet back up with Clemente in two hours . 
What are you afraid of ? 
The entrance must be here . 
Terè , where you going ? 
- Terè , what are you doing ? - Terè . 
Terè . 
What are you doing ? 
Teresa ! - Teresa ! - Teresa ! 
Come on . 
- Tonì ? 
- What ? 
Are you sure we 're going up ? 
I mean , how do you know which way we 're going ? 
More walking , less talking , please . 
Otherwise , my superpower won 't work . 
- You heard that ? 
- Yeah . 
This is the sewer . I think we 're close . Come on . Follow me . 
Come , don 't worry . Let 's go . 
- Teresa ! 
- I can 't see a thing . 
Guys , come here ! 
What do we do now ? 
What do you think ? Let 's go . 
Sasà , throw it down . 
We 're coming , Wonderboy ! 
- Terè ! - Teresa ! Teresa ! 
Guys , come here ! 
Come here , guys . 
- Aniè ! 
- Guys ! 
- Aniello ! - Aniello ! 
Aniè , we found you ! Come on ! 
- Come here , come here , Aniè . 
- I knew you wouldn 't abandon me ! 
Guys , we 're not crazy . 
Wonderboy is real . 
That 's him ! He 's the successor to Munaciello . 
And he stole that figurine from the landlady . 
We did it , guys ! 
Gosh , I missed you so much . 
We missed you , too . 
He 's gone ! 
What now ?
