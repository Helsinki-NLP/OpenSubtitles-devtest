The kids went into the Underground . IN THE LAST EPISODE 
The landlady 's involved , too . 
They 're all looking for the same figurine . 
So ? Did you see Wonderboy ? 
- They stole the map ! 
- Put that down before you hurt yourself ! 
Does he have suction cups on his hands ? 
Guys , I told you . Wonderboy can do anything . 
I know this music . 
The secret laboratory of the Prince of Sansevero . 
He became obsessed with finding out the mystery of life and death . 
He discovered an elixir that could bring the dead back to life . 
Oh , my gosh , guys ! 
Wonderboy ! 
It went off when the music stopped . 
- Sing , Terè . - You have to try , Terè ! 
- Sing ! 
- Sing ! C 'mon , Terè ! 
- We 're gonna go this way . 
- And that would be ... 
That 's Nino D 'Angelo 's villa ! 
You need that figurine to find some legendary treasure ? 
And if that were true ? 
Chihuà ! 
The boy , do you want us to get rid of him ? 
What ? It 's here , it 's here . Nope . Walk ten meters , straight ahead . 
Go . 
I knew it ! We should have turned right . 
What do you mean ? It 's left . 
You two are getting me all confused ! 
I got it . 
They got lost again . 
Your dad 's the boss here . Go talk to him . 
If you tell him about the treasure , he might listen to you . 
Cirù , what , you wanna kill me ? 
Enough with that . 
I already told you , this plan is bull - - It 's crap . 
We had this conversation already . 
Do we wanna get the kids out of there or not ? 
Yeah . My cousin said it wouldn 't be a problem . 
He 's good to go . 
Still , I think that Ciro 's right . 
What if they catch us ? What if they go to the police ? 
And what the heck is up with those suits ? 
Francè , we can make it work . 
If they catch us and they call the police , we 'll just do it your way and tell ' em the truth . 
- Right . 
- Sound good , guys ? 
Dad ... come on . You still need a suit . 
I 've done everything I can . 
Better than nothing . 
Donna Angè ... my husband and kid are still out there . 
Don 't worry about it ! Go ! 
Wow , Donna Angè . It 's beautiful . Thank you . I 've never been to a VIP party an - - 
It 's not a party ! 
Make sure that this guy doesn 't do anything stupid . 
Let 's go get that Maradona figurine back . 
Now , I 'm tired . And hungry , too . 
- Sit down . 
- This way , then that way . 
There has to be a hidden passage , a tunnel . 
Chihuà , we need to knock it down . 
- You hungry ? - I 'm gonna knock you down . 
- What 's that ? 
- Pastries for everyone ! 
They 're so good ! They taste like they 're freshly baked ! 
After everything we 've been through , these are just what we needed . 
What 'd you think ? That I was gonna let ' em get wet ? 
- These things here are bombproof ! - Right . 
Terè ... you want some ? 
No . I 'm not hungry . 
Freaking Wonderboy ! 
What are his superpowers anyway ? 
Clearly , he hasn 't figured that out yet , either . 
Just like Spider-Man . When he got bit by that spider . 
Stop ! 
- Good morning ! - Good morning . 
Random checkpoint . 
Turn off the engine and keep your hands in plain sight . 
Right now ! 
- Are you stupid ? 
- I don 't know . Should I answer ? - Put ' em down ! - Oh , right . 
License and registration , please . 
Here . 
Take a look . 
- Well , it seems to be in order . 
- Give me that ! " Seems to be in order . " 
- Excuse me ... - Right . Excuse me , I 'm in a hurry . 
Gotta get to a charity event tonight . 
We found that your registration is in clear violation of the Highway Code , Article 7 , Section 3 ! 
- Verse 31 . - Shut up ! It 's not the Gospel ! 
Get out and come with us to the station . Get out ! 
Officer , come on . Look , we - - C 'mon . I don 't care . Section 3 is Section 3 . 
- You 're coming with us . 
- Wasn 't it Section 7 ? 
I thought you said your cousin was the real deal ? 
If it wasn 't for that officer lady , we 'd be screwed . 
Guys , let 's move ! We 're here to save the kids . C 'mon ! 
It says , " Maybe go this way . " But what does that mean , " Maybe go this way ? " 
Great , now he 's asleep . 
So , retracing our steps , at some point , we took this narrow alley . 
So , it isn 't this way . But then we walk straight for ten meters ... 
What does it mean , " straight for ten meters ? " 
Guys ... 
- Rafè ... 
- Wake up . 
I found it in San Severo 's lab . 
" A mortis limine restituo . " It 's Latin . 
What if this is the formula of the prince 's elixir ? 
To bring the dead back to life ? 
Gosh . I 'm getting goosebumps . 
If I bring this to my friend , this spirit I ask for help ... maybe I 'll see my mom again . 
But first , I have to figure out the formula . 
It 's got some drawings around it . 
Alchemy symbols . 
Each one of ' em can mean a lot of different things . 
What do we care about this elixir ? 
Did you forget we 're being held captive ? 
This thing was never based in science . 
The alchemists were kinda crazy . 
They thought they were magicians . 
Aren 't you the one who always says we have to believe in magic ? 
Here 's what we 'll do ... 
Teresa 's gonna study the elements on this parchment , and once we get out of here , we 'll help her out . Sound good ? 
- Dobermà , wake up ! - What is it ? 
It 's the aqueduct ! 
- Hey , c 'mon ! - C 'mon , wake up ! 
- C 'mon , let 's go . 
- Walk . 
- I don 't want ' em . - Walk ! 
The flashlight . C 'mon , princess . Let 's go . 
Donna Angè , nobody messes with Capuozzo Enzo ! 
Donna Angelica . 
It 's a pleasure . 
Maestro , it 's an honor to make your acquaintance . 
The honor is all mine , madam . 
I took the liberty of bringing you a gift . 
- Champagne ! - Hmm . 
Oh , we have plenty of bottles in our cellar ! 
And now you have one more . 
Maestro ! 
- Hey , Giovanni ! - I 'm leaving . 
- You know that guy ? - You 're leaving already ? You know how our coach is . I can 't stay out late . 
But I wanted to stop by and contribute to such an important cause . 
I 'll walk you out . 
Captain ! He 's the one who got Naples the Championship ! 
- Who ? - Good evening ! 
Come on , get it together ! Let 's go . 
- Finally ! 
- Maestro ! 
What happened ? 
Ten minutes ago , your boss called me and told me you had some trouble with the van ? 
Yeah , but you know our boss . He worries over nothing . 
Right . Shall we take a look ? 
Well , the mussels are here . The clams , lobsters , sea urchins , and a big sea bass ! 
Great . But what 's that noise ? 
The lobsters ! 
They 're still swimming , Maestro . 
- Right . 
- Only the freshest seafood ! 
Oh , and in regard to the catering , - everything must be perfect . - Of course . 
Bye , guys . 
Guys , do we really wanna mess with Nino D 'Angelo 's house ? 
Guys , he and I are colleagues . Just don 't make me look bad , please . 
Does anyone here know how to cook oysters and lobsters ? 
Guys , we can 't give up now ! 
We have to think about saving the kids . 
Sure . I 'll save ' em first , then I 'm gonna beat the crap out of them on our way to Brescia ! 
Whatever ! Let 's go , come on ! 
Dad , we need to talk . It 's important . 
We 'll talk when we 're home . But first you 're gonna apologize to me , Donna Angelica and your mom for all the mess you 're making . 
But do you know why the landlady wants that figurine so bad ? 
The figurine has something to do with a treasure that was buried - in the Underground over 500 years ago . 
- Just what we needed , some treasure . 
It 's true ! 
He stole treasures from all over Italy , and then he hid them in a cave . 
Then , when he tried to conquer Naples , he failed . 
And so he died with his treasure . Yeah ? 
Who told you this nonsense , huh ? 
Dad ! It 's not nonsense . 
It 's a famous story . 
Nobody has ever found the Grotta degli Sportiglioni . 
What do you think ? Why did Wonderboy steal that figurine ? 
It 's a hunk of rock , not the Statue of Liberty . Hey , and so what ? 
If we find it , we 're gonna be richer than Briatore . 
If you help us out ... we 'll find the treasure of Naples . 
The treasure of Naples doesn 't exist . 
Shut up , you don 't know a thing . 
Move it , come on . 
MENU A salmon " amuse bushy . " Shrimp and zucchini " Volvo-vent . " 
Swordfish " tar-tarry . " Oyster " quee-chay . " 
- Lobster " grating . " But ... 
- What is this stuff ? 
I just fried everything . 
Pitò , do you copy ? 
Pitò , you copy ? 
Donna Angè , give me a minute . 
Have you figured out where to dig ? 
If we dig here , it 's gonna take us straight into the Underground . 
You heard that , Donna Angè ? Okay . 
When the music starts playing , start digging . 
Guys ! Guys . Clemente 's here with one of the landlady 's henchmen . 
How did they even get in ? 
I wouldn 't be surprised if she bought up all of the raffle tickets . 
She was invited too ? 
I just sent Oscar and Mario upstairs with some trays ! 
Should we go right ... or left ? 
Really think it through . 
If we screw up again , she 's gonna kill us . 
If you want , I could lend a hand . 
I know this place pretty well . 
You think we 're three idiots here , huh ? 
Well , let 's just say you guys haven 't exactly proven yourselves otherwise . Am I right ? 
That 's what you get for being funny . 
You okay ? 
Yeah . 
" The most secret fear . " 
I think I know how to ditch these guys . We gotta spook ' em . 
If we scare the heck out of them , they 're gonna run off and forget about us . 
But we 're just kids . And they 're three morons . 
Chihuahua is afraid of lizards . 
The other day , one got inside our house and he lost it . 
Yeah , and this place is just crawling with lizards . 
Actually , I think we can come up with a better idea . 
The buffet is open , folks ! 
But please , try not to overindulge , all right ? 
' Cause we 've got the raffle coming up . 
Got it ? Got a lot of prizes . 
Take ' em off , go on . 
What is all this stuff ? 
Maestro , there must have been a misunderstanding . 
A misunderstanding ? 
I ask you for gourmet cuisine and you bring me this crap ? 
Shoot , it 's the landlady ! 
What landlady ? I 'm gonna call your boss ... 
- The landlady 's here . 
- ... and get you all fired . 
It 's delicious ! 
- So traditional ! 
- I did it for you ! 
The fried oyster is amazing ! 
Oh , really ? You liked it ? You really liked it ? 
Well ! Hey , Earth to Francè ! You wanna get caught by the landlady or what ? 
- Come on , let 's go ! - Oh , good . 
We did this just for you . The fritters ... 
Here . We 're on the right track . 
Let 's go . 
- What was that ? 
- Mice , maybe ? 
They 're taking a bath , I guess . 
Nope ! They 're not stupid . 
Here lives the king crocodile . 
Hey , kid , what are you talking about ? 
Why ? Don 't you know the story ? 
Everybody has heard about it . 
- Am I right , guys ? - Of course , we have ! - Yeah , yeah . - Yeah . Of course . 
So , 600 years ago , Queen Giovanna had the most ferocious crocodile in the Nile brought from Egypt . 
She locked him in a pit under the castle Maschio Angioino . 
Whenever she got bored of a lover , she would feed him to the crocodile . 
Then one day , the crocodile went mad from eating all their flesh , blood , and bones . 
Then he rammed down the walls of the pit and fled into the Underground . 
The last time he was seen , he was right around here . 
That 's all just nonsense . 
It 's not like a crocodile can live up to 600 years . 
You think ? 
Crocodiles living above can 't , but down here 's a whole another story . 
Hey kid , shut up ! 
Walk ! 
Donna Angelica 's waiting for us . 
- You go first . 
- Follow me . 
Thirty-two . The eel . 
That makes four ! I got four ! 
Wait , calm down , calm down , calm down ! 
' Scuse me . I got 14 , 25 , 89 , and 32 . 
So , once again , the prize goes to that lucky kid . 
You 've won a poster of Popcorn e patatine , a film of mine from back in the ' 80s . 
And it 's signed too , see ? 
It 's inspired by the eponymous , 16-track double album , which includes " Proviamo ancora " and " Notte in Bianco . " 
Where are you going ? 
Come here ! 
Antonia told us to keep an eye on the landlady and warn her if she goes downstairs . 
Ninety ! The fear . 
Stop . 
Did you guys hear that noise ? 
It 's like Gennaro told you . The king crocodile lives here . 
Who said you could talk ? 
Go back to your friends . 
Guys , keep walking . 
Maltè , is everything good ? 
All good , Chihuà . 
Eleven . The little mice . 
I 'm sorry ! What a mess ! 
- The tickets ! 
- I 'm sorry . 
Don 't you worry . We 're gonna check ' em all . 
No ! We 'd be up all night . 
Anyway , in the end ... ... that lucky kid will just keep winning . 
- No , please ! - Well ... 
And really , we 're here to listen to the Maestro sing , am I right ? - Yeah ! 
- I wasn 't planning on singing ! - I really wasn 't . 
- Oh , come on , don 't make me beg ! 
- Nino ! - Nino ! 
So , this is your master plan , huh ? 
Drowning out the noise of a jackhammer with him singing some little ditty with the piano ? 
Bravo , Maestro ! Bravo ! 
What , already ? 
I haven 't even started yet . 
Yeah , but now we want something a little bit more lively . Right ? 
- But ... - To have a good time . This is a party . 
But I just sang spur-of-the-moment for you . 
Yeah , you did , but ... now the party is heating up . Right ? 
And now , you don 't have any excuses . 
- Hey , calm down ! 
- Dig it . 
- I 'll dig . 
- Come on . Chop , chop ! 
So , Clemente just started digging . 
If she gets to the kids before we do , I don 't know what 'll happen . 
Well , what can we do ? 
She came here with an armed bodyguard . 
I 'll take care of it . 
Chihuà , now I heard it , too . 
- Don 't stop , don 't stop ! 
- Come on , hurry ! Hey ! 
You 're the one making that noise , aren 't you ? 
- Get off him ! 
- He 's messing with you ! 
- There 's no crocodile ! 
- Leave him alone ! - Come on . - Is that right ? 
Huh ? 
Just walk . 
Who 's messing with me here ? 
You too , son , are you messing with me too ? 
You 're not my dad . 
- Give me that ! 
- No ! - Give me that , give it ! 
- Drop it ! Put it down ! 
- Put it down ! - Put it down ! 
You and your freaking crocodile bullcrap ! 
- No , don 't ! - Don 't do it ! 
- No ! - Put it down ! 
Am I your dad or not ? 
Throw it , Chihuà ! Come on ! 
Am I your dad or not ? 
I said " No ! " 
- What happened ? - What happened ? 
What was that ? 
Put it down ! 
- Guys , the crocodile ! 
- The crocodile ! 
Oh , gosh ! 
Run ! 
Dang it ! Get off of me ! 
The figurine ! The figurine , no ! 
Who 's in there ? 
What are you doing ? 
Open the door ! 
So ? What 's going on in there ? 
I 've seen you before . 
Did I kill him ? 
Help me ! Let 's bring him in . 
Angelica forced me to dig a hole . 
Her henchmen are down in the Underground . 
They have the figurine . They 're holding the kids hostage . 
From here , you can go straight to the Underground . 
I 'm gonna make the hole bigger so that I can get through . 
Pitone , do you copy ? 
Pitò , do you copy ? Pitone , do you copy ? 
It 's her . What do we do if she sees us ? 
She 's coming . What do we do ? 
I 'll handle it . 
- You clumsy fool ! 
- Forgive me , ma 'am . I 'm so sorry ! 
I didn 't do it on purpose ! 
Look , I 'm gonna grab some stain remover . 
- I 'm gonna go down there . 
- No , don 't go . 
I told you , you can 't go down there . Angelica 's men are in the Underground . 
- No , Clemè , you have to let me go down . 
- Then we 'll go down together . 
Wait for me here , and ... Just stay here , please . 
Don 't move , okay ? 
No way I 'm waiting here ! 
Donna Angè ? 
Donna Angè , do you copy ? 
Help ! 
- Guys ! - He 's a monster ! 
Help ! 
I thought that we were just trying to scare those guys ! 
Guys , we 're stuck . 
I thought the crocodile was just an urban legend . 
So much for the " urban legend , " Gennà . He literally ate them whole ! 
Sorry , Aniè . Maybe your dad made it out . 
Like I 'd actually care ! 
- Oh , my goodness ! 
- Let 's hope he can 't break in . 
Don 't move . 
- Sasà , he 's looking at us . 
Sasà . - Just stay still . 
Donna Angè , do you copy ? 
Chihuà ! Where are you ? 
What happened ? 
Donna Angè , we had a problem . With a crocodile . 
- We had to get out of there ! 
- What are you saying ? And the figurine ? 
He stole the figurine , Donna Angè . 
It was that kid , the skateboarder , the Munaciello . 
You go home and tell the others to come out here . 
All right . 
Let 's go . 
Clemè , we have to go down there before she gets here . 
But we can 't yet ! I still need to make the hole bigger . 
- There 's no time for that , Clemè ! 
- But I can 't fit ! 
Open the door ! 
- All right , you go down . - Open the door ! 
And stay on this frequency here . 
- I 'll find the other walkie-talkie , then I 'll call you and guide you from here . 
- Open up ! - Go ! 
Pitò ! 
No ! 
Wake up ! 
- Oh , my . 
- " Oh , my " is right . You idiot ! 
What happened ? 
It was the caterers . 
- The caterers ! 
- Come with me . 
Come ! 
Hi . 
Is ... is that the figurine of Maradona ? 
And you 're the Munaciello , who robbed the landlady 's henchmen . 
Whatever you 're saying , you 're wrong . 
Where are you going ? 
My brother , Sasà , and his friends were with you . 
Why are you here ? 
I get it . You wanna run off and leave those kids in danger . 
Sure are some Wonderboy . 
Thanks . Your brother told me the same thing . 
Don 't move . 
Hey , what are you doing ? 
I 'm showing it to everyone in Naples . 
- Including the police . 
- Wait . No police . There 's the whole privacy thing , treatment of personal da - - 
How ' bout this treatment here ? 
Get up . What ? You crash-land on me , then give me orders ? Move it ! 
Well , I guess ... nice to meet you . 
I 'm Tonino . 
Antonia . Nice to meet you , too . 
Now , come on . Let 's go save the kids . 
That was quite the show ! 
But you 're gonna pay for it ! 
We 're not afraid of you . 
We 're gonna call the police right now . 
You 're not gonna call anyone . 
Get their phones ! 
- What are you doing ? 
- Hey , enough ! 
Give me your phones ! 
Do you still have your phone ? 
Yeah , but there 's no signal . 
- Crap . 
- We can 't call anybody for help . 
Aniè . When you said that you didn 't care about Chihuahua ... San Severo 's vial got hot . 
Burning hot . 
Almost as if it had sensed something . 
Go away . Leave me alone . 
Maybe it 's nothing . But one of the symbols on the parchment means " fear . " 
Maybe it 's not true that you don 't care about your dad . Maybe you 're only afraid you won 't see him again . 
And the vial sensed that . 
- I said go away ! 
What 's going on ? 
Scream and let that fear out . 
Don 't let it poison your heart . 
What am I supposed to tell you ? 
That that deadbeat is the only father that I have ? 
That it seems like he doesn 't give a crap about me ? But when we 're riding his motorcycle , I feel like I 'm the king of the town . 
But I still don 't know if I hate him ... or if I really love him . 
And if he 's dead now , then I 'll never know ! 
- Kidnapping ! This is kidnapping ! 
- Kidnapping , right . 
I 'm a famous singer . 
I have commitments . People are gonna notice my absence ! 
Move it . 
First you kick us out on the street , now you 're taking it out on our kids , too ? 
What did we do to you ? 
Hurry up ! Enough " our kids " this , " our kids " that . 
What happened ? What is all this mess ? 
They stole our van ! 
Maestro , we 're so sorry ! We ruined your whole event . 
What do you mean ? 
The fritters were a smashing success ! 
Come and see , come and see ! 
Ciccio ! Ciccio ! 
Quiet down . Quiet ! Shut it . 
You 're wak - - You 're waking everybody up . 
Ciccio , down ! 
Maestro , I 'm such a huge fan ! 
I want your autograph ! 
Shoot . 
What are you doing here ? 
You like getting beat up ? 
What about you , huh ? 
You like it , huh , getting ripped off by Clemente ? 
Wait . 
How did you know that he wanted to rip me off ? 
Well , he was looking for the figurine way before you . 
Now , I get it . 
There must be something very precious inside that figurine . 
You know what ? If I find it , you keep those houses ! 
Listen carefully ... you piece of scum . 
Forget about the figurine . 
And forget about the houses . 
Our deal is off . 
Get him out of my sight . 
- We 're not finished yet ! 
- And find a boat for me . 
You don 't know what I can do ! 
The crystals got darker . 
Maybe , you were right . They absorbed my fear . 
Better in here than in your heart . 
Whatever . We 're all gonna end up in the stomach of that monster . 
Calm down ! He can 't get us in here . 
If he doesn 't move within a week or a month , we 're gonna starve to death ! 
I still have some food with me . 
Let 's give it to the crocodile ! 
If we feed him enough , he might leave us alone ! 
- Good idea ! 
- Wow , Aniè , you 're a genius . 
What did you bring ? 
So , here 's a little cake . But this one stays with me . 
Then I have some cheesy bread . 
Give me ! That 's good , that 's good , that 's good . 
Hey ! He ate it ! 
Give me something else . 
- What 's in there ? - Here . 
- That 's a pasta omelet . - Good . Give me . 
Give him more ! 
- Take the pasta fritters , here ! 
- Go , go . 
Sasà ! Sasà , is that you ? 
Antonia ! 
Dang it , the crocodile 's here ! 
Thank goodness they 're alive . 
Stay there ! 
Don 't come out ! 
We need to get ' em out of there . 
So let 's make a deal . 
I 'll save the kids if you delete that picture . 
Let 's focus on the kids now . 
All right . 
Take this . 
It 's important . 
Guys , Tonino Wonderboy 's here too ! 
He came to save us ! 
I knew that he would never abandon us ! 
- Tonì ! - You go , Tonì ! - Tonì ! - Go , Tonino ! 
Crocodile ! 
Crocodile , I 'm talking to you ! 
You happy now ? 
- He 's coming for you ! 
- Run , Tonì , run , hurry ! 
It 's Tonino ! 
Tonino ! 
- You 're so strong , Tonì ! - Tonì ! - Guys ! - Wow , Tonì , you 're the best ! 
Tonì . 
You did a good job . 
- Just " good ? " He was incredible ! 
- Yeah , well , he 's still not Spider-Man . 
No , Rafè . 
You 're wrong . 
He 's better than Spider-Man . 
- He 's Wonderboy ! - Hey ! 
Thanks , Tonì . 
- Wonderboy ! - Wonderboy ! 
Donna Angè , the boat you asked for is coming . 
Where is Alfredo ? 
Where is Alfredo ? 
- You okay ? 
Okay , let me check . 
- It 's nothing . 
- Just let me check real quick , Sasà . 
- Stop ! - Just a sec - - - We 're fine ! Stop . - I hear you , but just let me check . 
- Give him a break ! 
These guys are strong . 
You should 've seen how they tricked those idiots . 
About that , do you know , if Chihuahua ... I mean , if my dad is still alive ? 
Your dad is fine . 
I heard him talking to the landlady , but he 's a rotten guy . 
Tonì ... 
Well , a deal 's a deal . 
I 'll forget I ever saw you . No , no , no , no . 
It 's a memory . 
- Bye , guys ! 
- Wait , Tonì . 
Shouldn 't we go looking for Lautrec 's treasure first ? 
Guys , don 't start up with all that again . 
But he 's right . 
We could use the money from the treasure to buy our houses . So that we 'll always be together . 
Enough with this messing around ! 
Do you know how hard it was for me to get down here ? 
Your parents are scared to death ! 
Hey , come on . They 're kids . They 're just playing pretend . 
" Playing pretend ? " You knew all about the treasure , too . 
Gennaro 's right . 
And if it is just a fantasy ... then why do you want to have that figurine so bad ? 
Let 's see if there 's anything inside of it . 
Hey ... the figurine 's mine . 
Tonì , I know you wanna keep that treasure all to yourself , but it 'd be enough for me to know that all those urban legends I read about the Underground and the magic of Naples are not just about some skeletons and a crocodile . 
" Some skeletons and a crocodile . " 
We wanna see what 's inside ? Yes . 
- You sure ? - Yes !
