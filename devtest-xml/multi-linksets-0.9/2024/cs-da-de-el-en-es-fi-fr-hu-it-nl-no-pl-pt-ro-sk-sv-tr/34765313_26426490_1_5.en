We figured it out , Tonì ! IN THE LAST EPISODE This isn 't just a picture . 
This is a clue ! A mother would do anything for her children ! 
I 'm not a mother ! 
If Clemente jumped from all the way up there , the sea must have taken him away . 
Don 't you worry , Donna Angè . 
- I got this . 
- No ! 
Didn 't you hear what she said ? 
You 're not in charge anymore . 
The picture inside the figurine was taken at the Archaeological Museum . 
If I can make this elixir work , hopefully I can see my mom again . 
Antò ? Antò , you copy ? 
His hideout . 
She wanted to go to the catacombs , with the prince 's elixir . 
The most dangerous part is right aro - - 
We found the hideout of all the Munaciello . HE MAKES SOME RICH AND OTHERS POOR 
Have a nice evening . The exit is this way . Please , folks . 
This way . Folks , the exit is this way . Please , please . 
Have a nice evening , folks . Please , exit 's this way . 
Thank you . Folks , exit 's this way ! 
- Thank you . Have a nice evening . - Excuse me ! 
Please . Exit 's this way . 
Finish . Closing . Visit . Thank you . Thank you . Goodbye . Bye-bye . Goodbye . [ in English ] Bye . Goodbye . Have a nice evening . Goodbye ! Bye , bye ! 
Come on , time to eat ! 
Hey , what 's that ? - Hey , Savè ? 
You see those lights and that smoke ? 
- Yeah ? - What are those ? Spirit globes ? 
- What ? 
- Spirit globes ! 
Yeah , that 's exactly what it is . It 's " orbs ! " 
Go get a coffee from the vending machine . 
Make it quick , I 'm gonna lock up . Don 't sweat it . 
There 's something strange in the air tonight . 
Saint Sasà worked a miracle ! 
Wasn 't a miracle . Just a bike generator . 
Rafè , look here ! 
These are the names of the Munaciello . 
Sabello . 
Lucio . 
Silvestro ! 
Alfredo ! 
He 's the last one ! 
It 's all true , guys . 
We 're inside the Munacielli 's hideout ! 
It was the spirit of Alfredo . He guided us here with the smell of the Genovese sauce . 
This is where he made the figurine of Maradona . 
This used to be his lab . 
- Look there ! 
- What 's that ? 
Wow , who would 've thought ? 
He kept all the articles they wrote about him . 
" A figurine from a nativity set " was found inside a display case " in place of a precious clock . 
" This town certainly doesn 't see him as a thief , " but as a modern-day Robin Hood , " who steals from the rich to give to the poor . " 
Hey . How are you feeling ? 
I 'm getting better . 
Terèsa 's been here . 
We have to find her . 
But first , we have to find Clemente . 
Quietly . 
Donna Angè , what 's going on ? 
It 's been 25 years since the last time . 
Good evening . 
Good evening . Ma 'am , I 'm afraid we 're closing up now . 
It 's an emergency . We have to get in . 
" Emergency " ? What do you mean , " emergency " ? 
Anyway , tonight 's a no-go . We have technicians coming soon to set up our new exhibition , - " Parthenope , The Song of Naples . " 
- I 'll make a donation . 
A donation ? 
Please , come in . 
- Take care of that . 
- Wait , wait . The donation . 
Gosh , darn it . 
This way , please . 
Welcome . Welcome . 
That 's three of you . 
If you want , I 'll turn the lights on for you . 
They must have gotten in through another entrance . 
I assure you that I would have noticed if a group of kids was still in the museum . 
What now ? 
Here . Go ahead . 
So , the kids have their phones linked to the laptop . 
Now , we just gotta track their locations , then we 'll see where they are . 
- We need a password . 
Well , maybe I spelled something wrong . 
But the password 's always been " Come on , Naples . " 
- The three of us picked it together . 
- I knew it . 
Yeah , they 're not babies anymore , Mariù . 
" Nobody sees him as a thief . 
" He 's just ... " ... the last Munaciello . " 
Well , that 's a nice story about the Munaciello , but now what do we do ? 
Guys , look at this ! Come here ! 
What is this place ? 
It 's a darkroom that you can use to develop your photographs . 
Guys . This negative 's from the same photo that was inside the figurine . 
Let me see . 
I can 't believe it ! 
It must be another treasure map ! 
But how are we supposed to develop these photographs ? 
We need a tutorial . 
Rafè , see if there 's a signal . 
This thing doesn 't work down here . 
A 127 notifications ! 
- Wow , guys , they must be worried sick . 
- So what ? 
We have to find the treasure . Otherwise , this was all for nothing . 
No , we have to find Terèsa ! 
Did you forget ? 
She shouldn 't have run off ! Stop it ! 
Guys , if we stop now , everything we 've done will have been in vain . 
We 'll develop the photos , call our parents , and look for Terèsa , too . 
Now , give me your phone . We have to look for that tutorial ! 
- The hall down there . 
- Hey , it 's about time ! 
I already have to jump through hoops to get this all done in one night . 
Ugh . You 're the last thing we need . 
Oh , good evening ! 
Hey , be careful ! The siren 's costume cost a fortune ! 
They even left footprints . How could you not notice anything ? 
What kind of guards are you ? 
Clemè . 
It 's time you hold up your end of the deal . 
Track them down . 
Tonìno ? 
It 's me , it 's Clemente ! 
Come out ! 
We 're not playing games anymore . 
You can trust me . 
I was right . You know each other . 
Antò , lower your voice , or they 'll find us . 
- You 're a liar . 
- Antò . 
He 's there . He 's there ! 
What 's happening ? 
- Hey , Antò . They 're gonna find us . - Get off of me . 
Spirit , whose help I seek , I brought you something . 
This time , it 's not a jewel . It 's something even more precious . 
This is an elixir that brings the dead back to life . 
I thought that this was what you wanted . 
" A mortis limine restituo . A mortis limine restituo ! 
Mom ? 
Did you see ? I brought the elixir to the spirit so that you could come back . 
You did a great job . But I never left , Terè . 
The dead never leave . 
All the good things we 've experienced , all the good memories , and even the bad they 're part of you . 
Death cannot erase them . 
I want you here with me again . I want you to make me snacks for school . I want you to brush my hair every morning . 
You 'd never let me brush your hair , Terè . 
You wanna know what the secret was , hidden in that vial ? 
You were supposed to fill it with three things . 
Fear , love and pain . 
These three things , Terè , they 're what life 's about . 
Now , that you 've learned this lesson , you can go back to living your life without being afraid of pain . Even if Mom 's not there , you still have your friends , your uncle , and your boyfriend too . 
But I can 't live without you ! 
Bye , Mom . 
I love you . 
Thank goodness he knows his kids so well . 
We 've been doing this little show for three hours . 
I 'll show you that I know my kids . 
I figured out the password . 
" I hate Brescia . " I 'll add an exclamation mark , too . 
Great job . 
Now , that you 've made it clear you don 't know them at all , I can go straight to the police . 
Terè ? 
- Antò ? - Leave me alone , Tonì . 
Antò , please , listen to me . 
If word gets out that we know each other , you 're gonna get in trouble , too . 
It 's for the best , believe me . 
Trust me . 
Okay . 
Just don 't make me look like an idiot . 
Tonì . Look over there . 
We found them . 
They look like branches . But they 're actually tunnels . Give me that photo . 
Now , you trust me . 
Antò , you 're a genius . 
How are we gonna copy it , though ? 
- Can we use that one ? - Wait , wait . 
Hey . 
I 'll go . 
I found you , finally . 
Excuse me ? 
What do you want ? Here . Go get a coffee . 
Get out of here ! Scram ! 
" Go get a coffee . " 
It stinks ! 
There 's nothing that can stop Capuozzo Enzo ! 
Gennà , look at this antique ! 
Of course , it 's broken . 
It 's boiling , boiling ! 
I 'm so hungry . 
I wanna put a little tomato in there . 
Let 's cook some pasta with that after . What do you say ? 
Who are you ? 
You 're that gang of brats ? 
Where 's the figurine ? 
- And who are you ? 
- The guy who 's gonna beat you up . 
The figurine . 
What was inside it ? 
I 've had enough now , all right ? 
You 're right . 
There was a treasure map inside of it , but Tonìno took it ! 
- And now we 're trapped down here ! 
- You know what we 're gonna do ? 
All of us together , nice and easy , let 's go find Tonìno . 
Otherwise , things are gonna get ugly ! Real ugly ! 
What 'd you do , take a tour of the Naples Underground ? 
- We have to get them out of there . 
- Of course . 
We 're still stuck on this , though . Look . 
The last thing we need to figure out is your friend 's favorite song . 
Which song ? 
It 's the security question , Terè . 
We don 't know the password . 
" Gaiola Is Our Lucky Charm . " No . 
- All right ! 
- Way to go , Terèsa ! 
Great job . 
- It says that they 're here . 
- But where ? 
Maybe it 's there ! 
Wait for me here . 
It 's narrow , but wide enough for me . 
Terèsa , be careful . It 's dangerous . 
She knows what she 's doing . 
Terè , be careful ! 
This city 's magical , isn 't it ? 
The moment we met , you almost knocked me out . 
And now , I 'm gonna kiss you . 
Tonì . 
Your time is coming up . 
Give up . 
Down there ! 
That 's the one they stole from me . 
- Let 's split up . 
- Bring ' em here ! 
Give me a smile . 
You 're so beautiful . 
What 's wrong , Angè ? 
Alfredo . 
Alfredo ? 
What 's he got to do with this ? 
It 's like he 's trying to tell me something . 
- I 'll go there ! - Wait , wait ! I heard something . 
Antó , look . 
" Zeus was jealous to the point of madness . 
" He couldn 't accept that the siren , " Parthenope , was in love with the centaur Vesuvius . " 
Look into each other 's eyes , come on ! 
Good . 
These two are perfect . 
Call the dancers . 
Make up an excuse . Tell ' em the event 's been postponed . Go , go . 
Play that music , just like I told you . 
- What is this music ? 
Hey , who are you people ? 
- Excuse us a minute . 
- What do you mean , " a minute " ? 
- We 're working ! " A minute . " 
- Calm down ! Relax . 
" Hey " yourself , you stupid , lisping dog . 
You 're the last thing we need ! 
Do they know it 's us ? 
No , but the landlady 's distracted now . 
If we want to escape , this is our chance . 
Move it ! I have to see if it 's dangerous , come on ! 
' Cause then I have to cross it , too ! Come on , come on ! 
Guys , these gases are toxic ! 
Come on , kids , come on ! 
I 'll kick the crap out of you ! 
Move ! I 'm coming now ! Move it ! 
What are you doing ? 
Let me see . 
What is that ? 
That 's the siren , Parthenope . 
If you hear her voice , you 're about to die . 
No . No , no . 
I can 't die . I can 't die , not now . 
No . No , no , no . 
- Run , guys ! 
- Wait for me ! 
This way , guys ! 
I knew it was you ! 
Terè . 
We 're unstoppable ! 
Come here . 
Clemè , how are you feeling ? 
- I 'm good . 
I 'm good . - What happened ? 
Nothing . It 's all good . 
So ? 
- Tonì , what 's going on ? 
- Nothing . 
You keep this . 
Before we head to the underground , I have to go get something I need . 
Meet you at my RV . 
- Tonì , tell me what 's going on now . 
- Nothing 's going on , Antò . 
I 'll meet up with Clemente , and we 'll go down and find the treasure and the kids . 
- It 's just that it 's dangerous - - - " For a woman " ? 
This woman here saved your life ! 
And Clemente ? Where is Clemente ? 
He ran off again ! 
- Go get him , then ! Go get him ! - Hey ! 
Just stop it ! 
Donna Angè , we did all that we could ! 
And if you don 't got your money , you don 't got your men . 
How dare you . 
I even had to make a donation to get in there ! 
Chihuahua did the right thing when he ditched you . 
Let 's go . Let 's get out of here . 
Losers ! 
You 're gonna pay for this ! 
You jerks ! 
Here . 
It was inside the figurine . 
You ruined our lives just for a picture . 
Angè , inside this figurine , I hid the map to the treasure . 
- In case anything happens to me - - - And what the heck would even happen ? 
Something . If something serious happens , you have to come get me . 
When I 'm pregnant ? 
Don 't go . Don 't go . 
I don 't give a crap about that treasure . 
I want you . I want a dad for our baby . 
A dad who your parents don 't approve of ! 
I 'm just tired of hiding , you know ? 
- Let 's get out of here ! 
- Where 'd we go ? 
Let 's get out of here ! 
I don 't know . Let 's run away , let 's do it together ! 
- You just don 't get it , then . 
- What , Alfrè ? What don 't I get ? 
People here treat me like a thief . 
I 'm tired of it . 
Once I find Lautrec 's treasure , 
I 'll become the new hero of Naples . You get me , Angè ? 
The new hero of Naples , my love . 
I hope you do ! 
But I 'm not gonna be a part of your madness . 
Hey . Can you stay here at home for a bit ? 
- Yeah . 
- Yeah ? I 'm gonna look for you sister . 
I never thought you 'd come and save me . 
You 're really the best , Dad . 
My boy , what 'd you think , that I 'd just give up ? 
Yeah . 
You 're okay , right ? 
Everything 's good now . 
It 's all good , same as always . 
Dad , I do all these things for others , for what ? 
But what happened to Tonìno ? 
He went with that old guy to his RV . They 're gonna look for the treasure . 
He never gave a crap about us .
