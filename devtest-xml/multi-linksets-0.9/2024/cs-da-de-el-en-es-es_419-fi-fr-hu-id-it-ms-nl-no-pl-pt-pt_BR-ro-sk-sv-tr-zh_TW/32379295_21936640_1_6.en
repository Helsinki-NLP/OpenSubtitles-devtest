It 's out of love and respect that everybody calls me 
Samsik , Brother Samsik , Uncle Samsik . 
And I just love it . My nickname , I mean . 
Once that 's in place , I 'll be an official member of the Cheongwoo Federation . 
You understand what that means , right ? 
So I 'll be the one reigning over the nobility . Yes . 
We all will be eating pizza like the Americans . 
Pizza , I 'm sure that none of you have heard of it . 
Ah , it 's extraordinary . 
He is Manager Kim San from the National Reconstruction Bureau . 
Well , he studied economics in the US . He was also an Albright Scholar , Sir . 
Minister Choi . The way forward for South Koreaâ  ¦ is laid out here . 
You know Yoon Palbong of the Dongdaemun gang ? 
I can give you his turf . 
Yoon Palbong is sending 25 of his guys to the Innovation Party event so he can cause a scene and ruin the speech . 
Yoon Palbong is our prime target . 
Better make damn sure to break that bastard 's legs . 
I will have to teach him a proper lesson at the Innovation Party speech later . 
- Don 't you worry about him . - Killâ  ¦ Yoon Palbong , quickly . 
Huh ? 
During my time in America , there was beauty and abundance everywhere I 'd look . Meanwhile , my countrymen were stripped bare and starving . 
Do you know what pizza is ? 
You know what pizza tastes like ? 
Have you really had it before ? 
Seohae Oil , Sail Developments CEO Pak Doochill 
I can tell just by looking into someone 's eyes , whether they 'll make it or not . You , Manager Kim , have potential to become president . Well , at least Minister , for sure . 
Yeah , maybe I 'll call you Minister . 
How long would it take to get it running ? 
I 've got a straight answer for you . 
Stop seeing Choo Yeojin . 
And if you 're Choo Intae 's son-in-law , the dream will never be fulfilled . 
The Reconstruction Bureau is being shut down . 
The National Reconstruction Projectâ  ¦ I 'm not gonna give it up . 
Is it true you left the Ministry of Home Affairs ? 
Do you think there might be a position for me in the Innovation Party ? 
I think The Innovation Party isn 't ready yet . 
No matter how hard I try , there 's nothing that I can do . 
Effort is meaningless in this world . Why not flip it upside down ? 
I have this dream . 
There 's a version of South Korea that I want to create . 
Except that 's not a real dream . 
That 's hypocrisy . 
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream . 
Then focus only on what you want from now on ! Focus ! 
I want to revive it ! 
I want the National Reconstruction Project to go forward ! 
I 'll break up with her . 
Leave . 
In life , when you gain something , you 're bound to lose something else . 
I have a great plan for us . The Cheongwoo Federation will eventually control the entire country . 
A great plan ? 
The establishment of a parliament . And we buy off the entire National Assembly . 
Is there really a need to kill Yoon Palbong right away ? 
You 'll need him for the next election . 
I don 't need him . 
Give it to Taemin . 
I 'm sure he 's got a grudge against Yoon Palbong . 
Who does he want dead now ? 
If the job gets done the right way , then you 'll head to Osaka . 
I have evidence that Kang Seongmin was an active member of the Sineui Alliance . 
Kang Seongmin has just put out a hit on a certain Yoon Palbong . 
Oh , I 'm here to save Yoon Palbong . 
- Get out of my way , you dirtbag ! - Hey , wait ! 
Ah , shit ! 
Haejun . 
Oh , Haejun ! 
Fuck ! 
Kang Seongmin 's father also died in an explosive accident . 
The Sineui Alliance is known for using explosives . 
The police report also states that Yoon Palbong was the first one to get shot . 
It seems that Choo Intae wasn 't their initial target . 
Uncle Samsik 
Uncle Samsik 
Hello ? 
Oh , Minister . Hello . 
Yes . 
Welcome . 
What brings you here at this hour ? 
You know Cha Taemin of the Sineui Alliance ? 
What ? 
Did you introduce Yoon Palbong to Kwangmin , so he could join the Party ? 
Yes . 
And your tip-off for the Kang Seongmin article ? Yes . 
What 'd you do that for ? 
Oh , I 'll take my coffee later . - Yes , sir . 
Yoon Palbong , uh , did a lot of Kang Seongmin 's dirty work for him , you understand ? 
Of course , I was involved in some of it . Yoon Palbong has betrayed Kang Seongmin . 
- One coffee , please . 
- Yes , sir . 
Betrayed him , how ? 
I can 't go into those details at the moment . 
You said we had the same dream . How can that be true when you have so many secrets ? 
Well , it 's just that you 're better off not knowing - - 
Mr. Choo Intaeâ  ¦ 
Did you order his assassination ? 
Again with that ridiculous imagination . 
I broke up with Yeojin . 
What exactly did you sacrifice ? 
You have quite the past , and you do all these dangerous things in the shadows . And you say we share a dream ? 
Did you see the article ? About An Yosub 's son , An Minchul ? 
Yoon Palbong and I were the ones who killed him . 
3 years ago 
If you need anything for your districts , feel free to direct your requests to me . 
I appreciate the sentiment . 
We 're thankful for all that you do . 
Hello , Assemblyman Kang . 
Ah , you 're here . 
You wanted to see me ? 
I saw the National Security Bureau yesterday . Something I heard intrigued me . 
What was it ? 
Regarding Cha Taemin . 
Didn 't he work for you in the past ? 
Definitely not as laissez-faire as they claim to be . 
I noticed they only killed off your political rivals . 
Very clever thinking on your end . 
Let me use those Sineui guys when I need ' em too . 
Sharing is caring , after all . 
An Minchul found out about the Alliance . 
Seongmin . It 's time to end this . 
What ? 
We 're heading for Osaka . 
Uncle Samsik said he would find jobs for us . 
I can 't do things like this . Not anymore . 
What 's wrong ? 
I need you . 
Cha Taemin disobeyed Kang Seongmin 's orders . 
Assemblyman Kang . 
On the way back hereâ  ¦ â  ¦ this jerk confessed . 
Can you catch Cha Taemin too ? 
Yeah , I 'll find him . I 'll take all my guys with me . 
Why don 't you just let Taemin leave ? 
You know very well that this one is the Sineui Alliance explosives expert . 
We can make use of him . Use his knowledge , and we can take care of An Minchul . 
All right . 
Then would Mister Yoon here be able to do a little more work for us ? 
Sure , why not ? Of course . 
What can I do for you in return ? 
I , uhâ  ¦ You know those badges , for the National Assembly ? It 's always been my dream to wear one . 
If you nominate me for the Dongdaemun seat , then I willâ  ¦ I 'll do anything . 
There is someone I detest . 
Kang Seongmin gave orders to Palbong to bring Taemin back to him . 
Think we 'd let you live if you ran ? 
Tell Kang Seongmin I won 't be doing any more of his dirty work . 
Fucking traitors . 
Did you think stowing away like filthy rats would stop me from catching you ? 
There is a way to get out alive . 
It 's simple . 
Should we throw you into the sea ? Or should we work together ? 
Iâ  ¦ I 'll do it . 
I 'll do it too . 
I 'll work with you . 
Palbong was blinded by the idea of wearing that golden badge and got his hands dirty . 
He caught Taemin mid-escape . And also killed An Minchul . 
Minchul ! 
Cha Taemin betrayed Kang Seongmin . So Palbong and I ended up killing Assemblyman An Minchul instead that day . 
Palbong couldn 't keep his mouth shut about it so we had no choice but to get rid of him . 
Why did you introduce him to the Innovation Party ? 
Because he was so obsessed with getting a National Assembly badge , I thought getting him the Innovation Party 's nomination would shut him up . 
What 'd you release that article for ? 
To slowly bleed Kang Seongmin dry . That man is not to be taken lightly . 
We need to take away his power little by little . Yeah , in order to eliminate him later . 
Where is Cha Taemin now ? 
In a secure hiding place . 
Mister Cha Taemin ? 
Mister Cha Taemin ? 
Hey , there 's a door here . 
Don 't move . Who are you ? 
Where is Cha Taemin ? 
I 'm also here to look for Cha Taemin . 
You 're on Cha Taemin 's side ! 
- Thatâ  ¦ that 's not it . 
- Where is Cha Taemin ? 
- Tell me now ! - No , don 't ! 
Why did you bring these people ? 
I swear I didn 't bring them here . 
Then why did you come ? 
We didn 't agree to meet today . 
To let you know that it 's dangerous , that we had to move you somewhere else . 
You weren 't gonna let me go to Japan , were you ? 
I don 't know about that . 
Is Uncle Samsik behind this ? 
No , he 's not . 
I thought you didn 't know . 
Uncle Samsik sent me to tell you that it 's dangerous here . 
That we had to move you somewhere safe . 
But Uncle Samsikâ  ¦ he abandoned me once before . 
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct Kang Seongmin 
Who are you ? 
I , uh , I used to , uh , I used to work here . 
What are you doing here ? 
Where 's Taemin ? 
I was wondering the same thing . 
- These items were found here . 
There are also traces of bombs being made . 
Ah , is that so ? 
Destroy all of it . 
Sorry ? 
You didn 't hear me ? 
Destroy all of it . Do it immediately . 
Sir , take a look at this . 
- Should we burn these too ? - Burn it . 
The Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct Kang Seongmin 
Hello ? 
Uncle Samsik . 
Yes , it 's me . 
So . Has he been moved ? 
- There was an incident . 
- What ? 
It appears that Pak Jiwook sent some of his men . Three of them , and Taemin killed them all . 
Huh ? What ? Heâ  ¦ 
He killed all three ? 
Yes , well , it all happened so fast . 
He 's suspicious of you , Uncle Samsik . He thinks you tried to kill him . 
What ? 
I happened to stumble upon the Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct with Kang Seongmin 's signature on it . 
Kang Seongmin 's signature ? 
That 's definitive proof that Kang Seongmin established - the Sineui Alliance . 
- Yes . 
And he burned it ? 
I saw him burning it , yes . 
I 'm sorry . 
Uh , all right . 
Good work . 
Pak Jiwook 's put a tail on me . 
Of the Liberal Party ? 
Yes , formerly a Japanese cop . 
Of all the people he could have hired , he picked this scrawny guy . 
And it appears he sent people after Cha Taemin . Taeminâ  ¦ 
Forget it , let 's just go . 
How is a Korean so good at singing jazz ? 
Who knows ? 
Maybe one day , we 'll even beat you in baseball . 
Ah , this guy . 
Hey , uh , you know Choo Intae ? 
The guy who got shot . 
I heard he 's got a bit of a following . 
Hey , don 't worry about that . 
Never gonna happen . 
I know . 
But still , we had riot control training . 
At the American headquarters ? 
We even conducted evacuation drills for the US embassy and the government personnel . 
Oh , shit . But that 's never gonna happen . 
Well , never say never . 
Never say never . Never say never . 
Wish you a swift recovery , Mr. Choo Wish you a swift recovery , Mr. Choo 
How many people turned up ? 
Around 200 people ? They keep coming . 
Ilmo Hospital 
My father has justâ  ¦ He has passed away . 
According to the wishes of the party , and for the future of the Innovation Partyâ  ¦ 
Ladies and gentlemen ! This was not an accident ! 
We have to reveal the truth about what happened ! 
Mister Choo Intae was unquestionably assassinated ! 
Whoever did this must be revealed ! 
We deserve to know the reason that this happened to him ! 
Let 's go , everyone ! 
Let 's all walk over to the alley where Mister Choo was shot ! 
- Let 's bring him back ! 
- Let 's bring back Choo Intae ! Let 's bring him back ! 
Follow me ! Let 's go ! 
I 'll go to the hospital now . 
All right . 
Mister Oh . 
Do what you can toâ  ¦ comfort Yeojin . 
Okay . 
Everyone ! 
Democracy is officially dead ! 
- That 's right ! - Justice for Choo Intae ! 
They were all terrified of losing their power ! 
An investigation must be performed for absolute certainty ! 
We must reveal the identities of whoever is behind Mister Choo Intae 's death ! 
How many people have gathered ? 
Is the riot squad there ? 
Is that enough to regulate a crowd that size ? 
Bring back Choo Intae ! 
Soojin , I 'll be right back . 
The current administration must step down ! 
Bring back Choo Intae ! 
Bring back Choo Intae ! Bring back Choo Intae ! 
Everyone ! The community 's out there . 
Let 's join the march ! 
Come on , everyone ! 
- Bring back Choo Intae ! - Prepare to fire ! 
Bring back Choo Intae ! 
Innovation is the only way forward ! 
This protest must end now ! 
Disperse immediately ! 
- Step down ! Step down ! 
- Bring back Choo Intae ! 
- If you do not disperse , we will shoot ! - Bring back Choo Intae ! 
- Disperse now ! 
- Bring back Choo Intae ! 
Bring back Choo Intae ! Bring back Choo Intae ! 
The current administration must step down immediately ! 
Step down ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Ladies and gentlemen , 
Mister Choo Intae 's daughter is now coming up to speak ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
Everyone ! 
- We need to clear out ! 
- Why ? 
- We can 't . 
No way ! 
- Why should we disperse ? 
What 's this all about ? 
A demonstration like thisâ  ¦ isn 't what he wanted . 
This is not what my father fought for . Nor what he believed in . 
Violence and chaos are not what he stood for . 
My father stood for the opposite . Prosperity for all . Coexistenceâ  ¦ and harmony . 
Not for us to all die together . 
And our party 's futureâ  ¦ must be democraticâ  ¦ and be peaceful , as per my father 's wishes . 
All of us have to clear out right now , in accordance with his wishes . 
We 've got to ensure no one else 's blood is shed . 
Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
You see ? I told you that nothing would happen . 
We don 't know that yet . 
Kang Seongmin will now try to pass the Local Government Act under everyone 's noses . 
And when he does , you have to make sure your presence is known . 
You mean go up against Kang Seongmin ? 
Just as I thought , you catch on quickly . 
We need him to get it passed . His reputation can 't be changed with the Liberals . 
That 's it , I have nothing else to teach you now . 
And I will get in his way and be thought of as a champion for democracy , right ? 
Let 's have another drink . 
Last night at 9 : 45 p.m. , the Innovation Party 's presidential candidate , Mister Choo Intae , passed away . 
Mister Choo Intae had a high approval rating and a strong chance of becoming President when he was attacked by an assailant . 
The anarchist group , the Sineui Alliance , is rumored to have committed the crime . 
Political commentators are projecting that this incident will have a negative effect on the chances of President Rhee 's reelection . 
The approval rating for the Democratic Party candidate had already been skyrocketing . The public is now keenly focused on how this incident will affect the results of the presidential election . 
So , this hereâ  ¦ 
Yeah , it 's the assemblymen against the Local Government Act . 
How many are there in total ? 
All things considered , I think it 'll be around twenty people . 
And without their votes , the parliamentary system has no chance of being reformed ? 
I guess not . 
So then what are we supposed to do exactly with this list of fools ? 
We can 't just buy them all off . 
There 's around twenty assemblymen opposing the Local Government Act . 
A clear attack on me , isn 't it ? 
Well , we haven 't received the campaign funding . 
So is An Yosub trying to bleed me dry then ? Shit . 
All right , sir . 
Go and meet with Mister An Yosub , and hurry . 
Sail Bakery 
Hey , got a lighter ? 
- Me ? 
- Yeah , kid , come on . 
It 's gotta be hard , following me around . 
Why are you here every day ? 
- I get in trouble if I don 't . 
- Hand me the lighter . 
I heard the police force fired you for taking bribes . 
Yes . 
Here . No one will find out . 
Take it , go buy yourself a bowl of gukbap . 
You know , you don 't have to be Pak Jiwook 's lackey , you idiot . 
Do your best . 
Excuse me ? 
- Me ? - This bread 's for you . 
He 'll be heading out very soon to meet Michael Jeong . 
He says to report that . 
Thank you very much . 
How 's Yeojin ? 
Have you called her ? 
Got a light ? 
Are you all right ? 
- You 're here early . 
- Can 't you ever be on time ? 
Why are you always late ? Huh ? 
The commander suddenly wanted some things done . 
- Like what ? - Personal things . 
Taking care of his plants and his ceramics . 
This is what Academy grads end up doing . 
Fuck . This is why we need to turn the world upside down . 
Hanmin . 
Don 't talk about it , make it happen . 
What ? 
Don 't just talk about it . 
Do something about it . 
Yeah , then what ? Will you join me ? 
That depends on what you do . 
Oh , I 'll show you how I change the world . 
That 's how you should handle it . 
Right . 
We have been receiving calls from all over the place . 
The way they 're all crying out for money . 
Yes , in a matter of moments , Kang Seongmin will come in here to beg and plead in remorse - - 
Why have the withdrawals stopped ? 
Don 't you realize how it affects my reputation ? 
Sir , please , the thing is , it wasn 't for a lack of tryingâ  ¦ I told him not to . 
Why ? 
Because of that ridiculous article ? 
Was it truly ridiculous ? 
Would you please excuse us ? 
What are you doing ? 
I know that you are suspicious of me . 
Yes , I was part of the Sineui Alliance . 
I wrote the Sineui Alliance Code of Conduct . Noâ  ¦ The Sineui Alliance was created by me . 
I was young and foolish and committed an unforgivable crime . 
I apologize . But , sir , I didn 'tâ  ¦ I was not involved in the death of yourâ  ¦ of Minâ  ¦ Assemblyman An Minchul . 
Please believe me . 
Okay ? 
Minchul was someone I looked up to like a brother . 
Why would I kill someone like that ? 
Because you were after his position . 
No , sir . 
I saw the way you looked at Minchul . You were envious . 
Of course , I was envious . 
It 's true . 
I envied him , and soâ  ¦ 
I held him in great esteem . 
Minchul 's dream , I canâ  ¦ I can make it happen . 
I will . Please ? 
Just this once . 
Give me one more chance , please . 
You really didn 't kill my son ? 
Please , you need to believe me . 
Then who killed my son , and why ? Why did they do it ? 
I 'll find that out , I will . 
I promise . And I 'll tell you . 
Sir . 
If the Federation casts me aside , I have nowhere to go , sir , nowhere . 
I 'll call you Father . 
I will ! 
You have my unwavering loyalty ! 
Please . Just this once , help me out ! 
Just this once . Save me , please . 
I need you . Okay ? 
Choi Minkyuâ  ¦ promised to give you control , and to set you up as his successor . 
Yes , sir . Yes , butâ  ¦ I have never thought about betraying the Cheongwoo Federation , I promise . 
And how will you prove that ? 
I 'll do what 's required of me . 
- What 's required ? 
- Yes , whatever it takes ! 
How about becoming Prime Minister ? 
Take control of the Liberal Party and get 100 people together . 
Sun Wooseok will bring about 50 from the Democratic Party . 
The newly-appointed and independents of the Assembly the Cheongwoo Federation supports , they make up another 20 to 30 . 
We create a new party with those 170 seats , plus you can become the Prime Minister . 
How about it ? 
Can you gather 100 men ? 
Yes , I can do it . 
I will make it happen . Yes . 
No matter what . I will . 
You are my son in Minchul 's place . 
Thank you , sir . 
He 's probably grasping onto Yosub 's hands and sobbing right about now . 
Completely unaware he 's taken the bait . 
I 'm sure Kang Seongmin would be grateful . 
Yes , of course , he would . 
He would 've never imagined this role . 
That kid has been in the palm of my hand since the day I bottle-fed him . Hey , why are there so many US soldiers ? 
US soldiers ? 
Something doesn 't feel right here . 
I heard it almost became an all-out riot . 
It would have , if not for Choo Intae 's daughter . Hey . She was his fiancee . 
Must 've been heartbreaking for you . 
- Hey . - Hey , Harrison . 
Did you hear ? 
It 's a mess out there . What 's the matter ? 
Ah , the younger officers issued a declaration . 
About what ? 
See it for yourself . 
" We condemn all factions , corruption , and political activities within the military . " 
" We will discipline all military personnel involved in fraudulent elections . We will enforce punishments on generals involved in corruption . 
We demand new reform within the military . " " We demand better treatment of soldiers . 
We are young officers who devoted our youth to serving our country . 
We young officers have endured our impoverished realities with pride as soldiers . 
We demand the punishment of the corrupt generals who trample on our pride . " 
Have you seen this declaration ? Yes . 
I wrote it . 
It seems most young officers are in agreement with this declaration . 
There 's also new intelligence from the US Army . 
Uh , I will be sure to keep the military under control . 
The Assembly can be bought but not the military . 
The occupation taught us that . 
What other intelligence was there ? 
The military looks set to appoint a new First Operations Commander . 
A new commander ? 
General Choi Hanrim is highly regarded within the military . He 's also very close with the US Army Commander . 
Choi Hanrim ? 
Did you first meet First Operations Commander Choi Hanrim at the Albright farewell party ? 
Yes , I met him there . 
Is that when you discussed the coup d 'Ã © tat ? 
General Choi Hanrim was the soldier that I had the utmost admiration for . 
He helped me when I needed it most . 
General Choi Hanrim First Operations Commander 
He was just like a father to me . 
Our dear Minister has so many different father figures . 
And so many he admires as well . 
Unfortunately , those fathersâ  ¦ are all dead now .
