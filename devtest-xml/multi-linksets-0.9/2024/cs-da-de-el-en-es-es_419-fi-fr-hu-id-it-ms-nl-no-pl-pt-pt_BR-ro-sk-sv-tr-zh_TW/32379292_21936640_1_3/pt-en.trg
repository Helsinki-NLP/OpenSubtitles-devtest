Samsik , aged 16 
Hey , Kang Ilsik . 
Kang Ilsik Kang Seongmin 's father 
Did you contact Osaka directly ? 
And who said that ? 
What are you doing ? 
Samsik . 
Yes ? 
You like red bean buns , right ? 
If you ... do me a favor , you can have as many as you want . 
Uncle Samsik 
Uncle Samsik 
Win Over 
Capital Defense Unit , Secret Bunker 
Hanmin . 
San , is that you ? 
You 're here too ? 
San , you gotta tell them . 
We didn 't plan any of this ! 
This was all Samsik , not us ! 
San ! Tell them , please ! 
Tell them it was all Samsik ! 
San ! 
Tell them , San ! 
San ! 
Captain Lee . 
Been a while , Hanmin . 
Jeong Hanmin , Lieutenant Colonel of the Capital Defense Unit The 55th Howitzer Regiment . 
So I guess you 're ... with the Second Operations Commander now , hm ? 
We ask the questions here . 
Lee Sooil Captain of the 55th Howitzer Regiment 
It seems there 's been a misunderstanding . 
I need to call General Jang Doosik . 
Questions , requests ... They 're off the table here . 
Samsik is here , isn 't he ? 
Where is Samsik ? 
Tell him to get in here ! 
Where is he ? 
Jeong Hanmin . 
All you gotta do is answer . 
Did Samsik plan this on his own ? 
How many times I gotta tell you , huh ? 
If you don 't fess up soon , Hanmin , you 're gonna die in here . 
When did you first meet Samsik ? 
Hey , all this food in here is cold . Get us something hot to eat and hurry . Come on , come on !

I 'd been passed over for a promotion that day , and I was feeling like shit . 
So I had quite a lot to drink . 
General Jang talked to me about the Logistics Command . 
So , does that mean he 'll fix you up with a job there , huh ? 
I 've had it with the miserable fucking military . 
Here , drink up . 
Here . Here , here , here , here . 
Come on , fill those glasses up . 
The incompetent idiots are snagging all the star rankings . And the factions fight whenever they want , don 't they ? Bow down to the government like we 're their fucking slaves . 
Now ... you call this the military ? 
What the fuck 's the matter ? Are you insane ? 
What ? 
Are you scared , huh ? 
You pathetic fucks . 
It 's time for some changes here , huh ? 
Our country 's a total mess and the soldiers have nothing better to do than drink all day long ! 
♪ Waterfowl ♪ 
So , our captain here seems to have a fire burning in his soul , huh ? 
Who 's gonna tame all that fiery energy ? 
What is this , huh ? 
I guess it 's a little unfair . 
You 're an Albright graduate , second in your class , and you didn 't get promoted , did you ? 
And who are you ? 
You want me to get you a star ranking ? 
A star ... 
You must be crazy . 
General Jang Doosik left the military . I wonder how he got his star . 
So that was how Samsik first approached me . 
We 'd just met , and he said all sorts of things . 
Some are from the Japanese military , others from the Manchurian . 
The factions fight , it 's all corrupt . Why is the military like this ? 
Because it 's been poisoned ? 
Yes , that 's right . Who poisoned it , though ? 
Politics . 
That 's what poisoned the military . 
The government turned the military into its puppet . We need to reform politics to cleanse the military . - And if not ... 
- And if not ? 
Then the military has to cleanse politics . 
You 'd just met ? Yes . 
Out of the blue ? 
Out of the blue . 
Even the Minister of National Defense gets his orders from Minister Choi Minkyu . 
Every key unit in the military is packed with Choi Minkyu 's guys . 
Don 't you think that seems a little off ? 
Yeah , b-but what can we do about it ? 
You know the head of the CIC , Hong Youngki ? 
If we use him , then we can sever the poisoned parts of the military . 
Hong Youngki is the most poisoned one of all . 
Exactly . 
Let 's use Youngki for everything we can and then throw him away in the end . 
So this is what Hanmin is saying ? 
That 's the statement he just gave . 
Uncle Samsik first met Hong Youngki on that same day . 
How do you know it was the same day ? 
I heard it later on . 
So Hong Youngki wasn 't in on it until after ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
What do you mean " heard it later on " ? 
I heard about the military supplies business . 
Selling off old US Military supplies ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
Jeong Hanmin , Kim Kwangmin ... they were also tied up in it , weren 't they ? 
The younger officers were resorting to skipping meals . 
Well , you must 've been aware of it , Captain Lee . 
Everyone was about to explode . 
Who suggested the US Military supplies business ? 
It was Samsik , of course . 
Kim San says Samsik met Youngki for the first time that day . 
Someone who barely knew Hong Youngki existed came up with this plan ? He planned it the second they met ? 
Samsik has always been that kind of person . 
Hong Youngki can be talked into taking control of key units around the capital . We 'll get you promoted soon and I 'll make you Deputy Commander of the Capital Defense Unit . 
Is this really possible ? 
How many soldiers have you stripped of their titles ? 
When Rhee Seungmin 's administration comes to an end , you think those soldiers would just leave you alone ? 
Hong Youngki 's easy to get to . 
Do you know what his main weakness is , Hanmin ? 
I don 't . 
It 's that he has too many enemies . 
And the fear that that gives Hong Youngki is his greatest weakness . 
Why did you lock up those petty thieves ? 
The US Military Command goes on and on about exploitation . And it 's all nonsense . 
They think I captured all those people and then framed them as communists . 
Those fuckers don 't know the first thing about commies . 
Anyway , I locked those thieves up because I had to do something . 
To satisfy them . 
You should let them go . 
Why would I ? 
We 're in business with some of the US Military Supply officers . 
If you grant a few of our requests , 30 % of the profits will be yours . And I 'll even provide you with a few sturdy men for your protection . 
And that 's how we won over Commander Hong Youngki . 
Yeah , in the end , the Seodaemun thugs were released immediately . 
- Yeah ! 
That 's the way this man called Uncle Samsik generally likes to operate . 
Uncle Samsik never does anything with just one objective in mind . 
The US Military supply business ? Though I didn 't know it at the time , it wasn 't just about money . 
Korean people have always had incredibly robust stomachs . 
They can eat canned food that 's two years expired , - and they 'll be completely fine . 
- Yeah . Expired food ? 
- I 'd eat that . 
- And Koreans are great drivers . 
You know that ? The best drivers , huh ? 
We can drive incredibly safely even with tires that US troops have been using for 10 years . 
Yeah , driving around on worn out tires ? That 's okay . We 'll drive on ' em . 
Without accidents . 
Expired products from US Military bases like used tires ... 
They 're still okay to use , right ? 
... and worn out vehicles were sold for 10 times their price on the black market . 
Scrap tires that were 10 years old ? 
We sold a hundred every day . 
Expired canned goods would get fresh new labels . And were sold by the hundreds , really . 
- Every day , more cash flowed in . 
- Thank you , sir . We packaged our products in Sail Bakery bread boxes , and then ship them everywhere as bribes . We sent them to the police , the press , the military . 
And 30 % of the profits went to Hong Youngki . Even so , they still made us a fortune . 
He 's not as crazy as he might seem . Samsik ... he isn 't like the rest of us . 
That 's what I thought . 
Receipts for army supplies 
Were you involved in this from the very beginning ? 
I got into it without knowing the finer details . 
Was the Capital Defense Unit your target from the start ? 
Not when I first started out . 
Who recruited Capital Defense Officers Pak Wonil and Kim Inho ? 
I did , sir . 
Here are Captains Kim Inho and Pak Wonil . 
- Nice to meet you . 
I heard you were both Albright scholars . 
Jeong Hanmin , Kim Kwangmin , these men are ... also Albright scholars like you ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
But you knew they were involved in the US Military supplies business ? 
I wasn 't sure . 
San . 
Hey , Kim San ! 
What brings you here ? 
Let 's chat for a moment . 
Kim Kwangmin CEO of Sanae Corporation 
- I should get to work . 
- It won 't take long . 
What is it ? 
I have a favor to ask you . 
All right , tell me what it is . 
Oh , San . 
We 're trying to build a caustic soda factory . 
- A lye factory ? 
- Yes . We already have a grant for five-ton pilot plant . But apparently , Daemyeon Construction submitted an identical application . 
So they 're trying to intercept it . 
Well , I 've already filed for an appeal . Is there any way you can help ? 
I 'll look into it . 
Thanks , I know you 're busy . 
So you 're saying it was all Samsik 's ploy to win Kim San over ? And the military supply business was bait ? 
And Kim Kwangmin , Sanae Produce 's owner ? 
He was recommended by Yoo Yeonchul from Daemyeon Construction . 
Did you go and tell them , the Cheongwoo Federation ? 
Yes , I did . 
I already told them . 
Do they know Director Kim Kwangmin at the Cheongwoo Federation ? 
Yeah , they did . I told them all about it . 
We need to speak with them again today . 
Oh , you 're here . 
This is Kim Kwangmin from Sanae Produce . 
- Yes , I 've heard good things about you . - Thank you . 
Have a seat . 
Hi there . Yoo Yeonchul from Daemyeon Construction . 
I 'm Kim Kwangmin . 
Mm . I heard you were withdrawing your application for the lye factory . 
Well , that all depends on you . 
You were an Albright scholar , weren 't you ? 
Yes . 
You really look like it . 
I 'm prepared to make you a lucrative offer . 
All I need is for you to withdraw the factory application . 
As long as you 're not trying to impact our business - - Hey , kid . 
Look , have you heard of the Cheongwoo Federation ? 
Yes . 
Isn 't that a group of businessmen from the northwest ? Its members are all top businessmen . That 's right . If you 'd like , we could help you become a part of it . 
Well , how would you ... 
Well , Yoo Yeonchul is just a laborer and he 's in the Cheongwoo Federation now . 
Don 't let this opportunity pass you by . 
Here . 
Why did Daemyeon Construction apply to build a lye factory ? 
Withdrawal of application for caustic soda factory establishment 
They were never really interested in the factory , were they ? 
No . I don 't think they were . 
It was just bait to lure me in . 
Hello ? 
Oh , hey , Kwangmin . It 's San . 
Daemyeon Construction withdrew its business plan . 
Really ? 
That 's good to hear . 
You already knew ? 
No , I didn 't know . 
I should buy you dinner as a thanks for looking into it . 
Don 't worry about it . 
They had Jeong Hanmin with the military supply business and Kim Kwangmin with the lye factory . 
And that 's how they got to your friends ? 
That 's right . 
This coffee is cold now . 
He needs his friends beside him . Yes . They should be there supporting him during these hard times . 
Ministry of Home Affairs 
Comprehensive economic policy for the 5-year National Reconstruction Plan 
I couldn 't let go of the National Reconstruction Proposal even at the Audit Bureau . 
I was afraid that my dreams would ... Well , never be realized . 
- Yeah , sure , yes . Thank you . - Please enjoy . - Great . 
Have a good day . - Thank you . 
- Hi . How are you ? 
- What can I get you ? 
- How much are they ? 
It 's 300 hwan for one bag . 
- I 'll come back . - All right . 
No matter how hard I tried , it was hopeless . 
Hey , when did you get here ? 
Hey , San . 
Jeong Hanmin . 
Oh , oh , oh . Okay , you 're pretty drunk . 
You 're making me wanna stop drinking . 
Okay . Okay . 
Hey , let me introduce you . 
These are Captains Kim Inho and Pak Wonil . 
Nice to meet you . 
I heard you were both Albright scholars . 
Long time ago . 
Long time ... 
You 've had a lot to drink . 
I 'm not in the military . 
Jina . 
Jina , your uncle 's home . 
Jina . 
- Uncle . 
- Jina . 
Come here . Look . I got you a little treat . 
Have some . 
Uncle , were you out drinking ? 
Sorry . 
It 's cold . 
Go back inside . 
- Hi , I 'm back . 
- Are you all right ? 
- Yes , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Oh , my . 
You should come in and lie down . 
Ooh . Goodness , you 're quite drunk . 
- Come on . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . 
Come in and rest . 
What are you thinking , huh ? 
Is there something you wanna say ? 
Even if there is , you can 't say it anyway . 
You don 't have the energy to say anything . 
When the US Military was bombing us nonstop , you made my brother go out and beg for scraps to eat . 
He left his pregnant wife at home . You made him go during that ... during that air raid . 
And my brother died . Do you know how hard that was on his wife ? 
Father . 
It shouldn 't have been him . It should 've been you that day . 
Not him . 
It should 've been you instead . 
Yeah , he just passed by here . 
Hmm , he was very well-dressed . 
Uh , he 's just handsome , is all . Yeah , bye now . 
- Thank you again . 
Innovation Party 
Are you sure he 's coming ? 
Have the guys call up Uncle Samsik , all right ? 
Just wait there . 
He 'll eventually make his way over . 
Just stay on standby and be ready . 
He 's coming , he 's coming . Kim San , he 's on his way . 
Let 's get ready . 
Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Quick , quick , quick ! 
He 's here , he 's here . 
He 's going in . 
Oh , fuck , he 's leaving . 
Wait . 
Just go in . 
Go on . 
Go inside . 
He 's in . He 's in . 
Can I come in ? 
Why did you leave like that ? 
I remembered I had something to do so I took care of it . 
Is Mr. Choo not here ? 
My father 's out at dinner . 
Could you just wait a little ? 
Choo Intae just left . 
I think I 'll have to come in tomorrow . Even though it 's a Sunday . 
Someone has to go through all of this . 
So many people wanna be party members . But we 're still short-staffed . 
San . 
Oh . I 'm sorry . 
Go and lie down . 
What ? 
Lie down . 
I 'll just take a short break . 
And I 'll take one with you . 
Actually ... I could be taking a long break soon . 
Is it true you left the Ministry of Home Affairs ? 
Do you think ... there might be a position for me in the Innovation Party ? 
So you want to get into politics ? 
I think the Innovation Party isn 't ready yet . 
I have great respect for Mr. Choo Intae . 
And I believe ... 
- What is this ? What is this ? - Fire ! 
Are you okay ? 
Police ! 
Somebody help ! 
Where is everyone ? 
Mr. Choo . Mr. Choo ! 
Mr. Choo ! 
Choo Intae 's fleeing ! 
Hey , Choo Intae ! Look ! He 's getting away ! 
Hey , Choo Intae is fleeing ! 
Hey , Choo Intae ! 
Gyeongmudae 
Inspired by the encouragement and strong support of the people , I hereby announce a decision I 've made out of love for the nation . 
I am ... revoking the withdrawal of my presidential candidacy . 
Ministry of Home Affairs 
In order to save South Korea from its current state of crisis . 
Democratic Party I am officially ... 
Liberal Party ... presenting myself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election . 
Rhee Seungmin ! Rhee Seungmin ! - Rhee Seungmin ! - Rhee Seungmin ! 
- Rhee Seungmin ! - Rhee Seungmin ! 
It was the day that the president announced his candidacy . 
All his supporters were out in the streets . 
During the war when our country was taken from us , we were defenseless . 
An incompetent head of the household . 
A coward of a man . That had always been my idea of a father . 
Mr. Choo Intae had been another father figure to me . 
But in the end ... he was no different than my own father . 
But I guess I 'd always thought that ... fatherhood looked that way . 
You finally picked up . 
No matter how hard I try ... there 's nothing that I can do . 
Effort is meaningless in this world . Why not flip it upside down ? 
And what if it 's wrong ? 
Then spit it out . 
You 'll know if it 's poison the minute it touches your lips . 
And my proposal ? 
Can we save it ? 
Save it , or kill it , we can do anything . 
I 'm asking if we can make it happen naturally . 
Letting it happen on its own will also cost you . 
Does the Earth 's rotation and revolution just happen ? 
Is it a coincidence that the Sun lights up the Earth ? 
I want more power . Tell me how to get it . 
I will give it to you . 
I 'm the one who can give it to you . 
I 'll wait to hear from you . 
Mr. Hong , my name is Samsik .
