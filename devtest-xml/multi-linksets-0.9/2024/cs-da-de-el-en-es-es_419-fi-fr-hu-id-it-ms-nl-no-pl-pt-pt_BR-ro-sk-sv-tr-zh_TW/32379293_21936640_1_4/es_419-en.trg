I caught these punks at the last second trying to escape the country . 
Hyung . 
You trying to abandon me and get away ? 
Seongmin . 
You ... you 've deceived us . 
What did I do ? 
The Sineui Alliance is worthless . It 's a puppet exploited by your ambitions . 
Why should we ... why should we kill people for you ? 
You shouldn 't 've made the Sineui Alliance if you wanted to become an assemblyman . 
Is that why you betrayed me ? 
Mister Kang , listen . 
Taemin . We should forgive him . 
Our dreams were almost destroyed ... by someone whose head I put a roof over , someone I raised . 
Exactly . So please , just let Taemin live . 
I 'll send him off to the salt farms and keep a close eye on him .

UNCLE SAMSIK 
THE GREAT PLAN 
It was the day that the president announced his candidacy . 
All his supporters were out in the streets . 
Oh , you finally picked up . 
No matter how hard I try , there 's nothing that I can do . 
Effort is meaningless in this world . Why not flip it upside down ? 
And what if it 's wrong ? 
Then spit it out . 
You 'll know if it 's poison the minute it touches your lips . 
And my proposal ? 
Can we save it ? 
Save it or kill it , we can do anything . 
I 'm asking if we can make it happen naturally ? 
Letting it happen on its own will also cost you . 
Does the Earth 's rotation and revolution just happen ? 
Is it a coincidence that the Sun lights up the Earth ? 
I want more power . Tell me how to get it . 
I will give it to you . 
I 'm the one who can give it to you . 
I 'll wait to hear from you . 
DECEMBER 22 , 1959 SEOUL , SOUTH KOREA 
BANYA HOTEL 
This way . 
I assume that you know what kind of meeting this is ? 
Yes , sir . 
You cannot breathe a word of what is discussed here outside this room . 
I 'll keep that in mind . 
We have also reviewed your National Reconstruction proposal . 
I have got some big plans for you . 
Yeah , great plans too , I 'll tell you that . 
Whether it 's money or power , I can provide everything . You want influence ? I can get you married in . 
Well , I 'm already engaged to be married . 
Mister Choo Intae 's daughter is , well , she 's my fiance . 
What did you say ? 
You and Choo Intae 's daughter are what ? 
I said we 're engaged . 
Choo Intae ? You 're gonna be his son-in-law ? 
I have great respect for Choo Intae . I respect him more than anyone else I know . 
You said they were done . 
Yes . I think it 's a misunderstanding , that 's all . 
Misunderstanding ? 
He says he respects him ! 
Yes , it 's true , I have a lot of respet for him , but ... I don 't understand why that 's ... 
You clearly don 't know what this meeting is . 
Ah , will you excuse us while we go and straighten this all out ? 
Please step out with me . 
Get up . 
Right this way . 
Wait . What was all that ? 
Keep seeing her , but in secret . Just three more years . 
Oh , that is total nonsense . 
Three years goes by fast . Huh ? 
I will not stop seeing Yeojin . 
Why did you come here then ? 
To realize my dream for South Korea . 
You 've gotta sleep to have dreams . How are you dreaming without sleeping ? 
The Cheongwoo Federation 's a bed and Chairman An Yosub is a pillow ! 
You need to get in that bed with your head on that pillow . 
We 're not on the same page . 
To get on the same page , you gotta listen . 
He 's acting so high and mighty . 
I think I may have sweet talked him a little too much . It 's gone to his head . 
Should I follow him ? 
Yeah . Let 's see where he goes . 
Sir , we ... we don 't want to get involved with Choo Intae , do we ? 
I mean , there 's no benefit . He would be useless to us . 
We should find someone else , right ? 
We can find someone better . 
He understands now . I explained it . 
He 's not our guy . No . 
I get it , but when he left , he said he would end things with Choo 's daughter , with Choo Yeojin . 
Do you think he is capable of beating Kang Seongmin ? 
He 's too green . 
I just need a little longer to work on him , sir . 
- Oh , they 're coming out . 
- Hey , she 's out now . 
ILMO HOSPITAL 
Excuse me . 
- Will you be okay ? 
Choo Intae ! 
- Choo Intae ! 
- Thank you , everyone . 
Thank you , fellow citizens . Thank you . 
Thank you very much . 
He 's really there right now ? 
Yes . 
Choo Intae ! 
Acting friendly , posing with them . 
Posing with them ? Why would he pose with them ? 
Oh , he just couldn 't sit still , could he ? 
They 've got their arms around each other . 
Gosh , they look like a family already . 
Their arms are around each other ? 
Yeah . 
Sir , did you check the polls this morning ? 
Oh yes . 
The polls are showing us that the people are desperate to maintain democracy . 
So does this mean your daughter will be active within the party ? 
Yes , I will . 
This particular incident emphasized to me the values that we must protect as well as the importance of this election . 
That 's right ! 
You 're Kim San of the Ministry of Home Affairs , right ? 
Yes . 
Do you play a particular role within the Innovation Party ? 
I am not a politician . 
I 've come here today on personal time . 
All right , now let 's leave it there . 
We 're gonna make our way to Innovation Party headquarters . 
Should we head over there ? 
- Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
I 'm heading to the office now . 
Are you sure you feel up to it ? 
Yeah , of course . 
All right . 
Does this mean you 're joining the party ? 
I 'm thinking about it . 
There 's really no need to force it . 
I 'll be in touch . 
How dare you show up here ? 
I could tell you the same thing . 
Why are you here ? 
All right , how is this , Minister ? You promise me you 'll see Yeojin in secret and I 'll recommend you for the chairman of the Democratic Party 's Economic Policy Committee . 
- In secret ? 
- Away from prying eyes . 
How could I possibly become chairman of that committee ? 
I 've told you before , it 's nothing . Look , we 've got a great plan here , Minister , involving you . 
So ... so what ... what is this great plan of yours ? 
Well , what do you plan to do ? 
- End it ? - No . 
Date her in secret ? 
Tell me what this damn great plan is you keep mentioning . 
Now you 're changing the subject again . 
I think you 're great , but I don 't like this side of you , Minister . 
I 'm changing the subject here ? 
That 's what you 're doing . I hate when you do this . 
CAPITAL DEFENSE UNIT , SECRET BUNKER 
How long 's it been since you had any contact with Mister Kim Kwangmin ? 
You knew that Samsik won him over , didn 't you ? 
I 'm really not sure . 
- How about the invite list ? - Here you go . 
We were only able to pay for the print material . 
The issue is the campaign vehicle . 
At this rate , we won 't be able to keep up with the campaign schedule . 
What brings you here ? 
Well , I was worried . 
Ah , that 's really kind . 
Yeojin . 
They said no bus for us until we pay off the balance . 
What do we do about our upcoming events though ? 
Listen , if you need a campaign bus , I ... 
I know some folks who 'd be interesting in sponsoring . 
Should I get them in touch with you ? 
Miss Yeojin . 
Um , where 'd you get these buses ? 
They 're buses that US troops discarded . 
Oh yeah , they 're great , right ? 
It 's nice to meet you . 
Oh , and I am Yoon Palbong . 
That 's why Kim Kwangmin introduced Yoon Palbong to the Innovation Party . 
Didn 't you know about that ? 
I was unaware . 
Hey . 
I don 't like Choo Intae . 
I know . 
But I still have to do this , don 't I ? 
Yes . 
Did you finish the book ? 
I almost had an aneurysm reading this , you jerk . 
The path of coexistence 
Father , these are some of San 's friends . 
Oh , sir ... No , I ... Sir , I , um ... 
Would you sign this ? 
That 's done then . Thank you for your hard work . 
I said you shouldn 't come here , didn 't I ? 
Hey , hey . I don 't have a lot of time right now . 
What if someone sees you in here ? 
Tell Kang Seongmin that I am now Choo Intae 's campaign security officer . 
It 's amazing how things work out when you actually listen . 
- And did you hide that book that I gave you ? 
Yes , I hid it very well inside Choo Intae 's office . 
If Choo goes down , you 'll deserve all the credit . 
Can you do me a favor , and tell Kang that I 'm doing a good job ? 
All right , but why are you worrying about that , huh ? 
Thank you . 
When will you kill Yoon Palbong ? 
The plan is in motion . 
And why are these plans taking so long ? 
What if Minkyu finds out about it ? 
I wanted to ensure it 's done in the safest and most convincing way possible . 
And I am telling you that it would be safest to kill him quickly ! 
Seriously , Uncle , who else but you is willing to listen to my nagging ? 
- I 'll speed up the process . 
- All right . 
Have you met with Cha Taemin ? 
Not yet . 
You mean , you don 't want Taemin doing it ? 
It 's not that . It 's just that he 's repenting and keeping a low profile right now , so ... is it necessary ? 
Taemin tore my heart wide open . 
He betrayed me . 
During my greatest time of need , Cha Taemin abandoned me ! He left me ! 
If he wants my forgiveness , tell him that no matter what , he must do this . 
- Take those off him . 
- Yes , sir . 
You must resent me a lot . 
I do not resent anyone . 
If I did , I would 've left already . 
Yeah . I 'm sure you would have . 
Who 's he want dead now ? 
Yoon Palbong . 
Who killed An Yosub 's son ? That Yoon Palbong ? 
Yeah , that Yoon Palbong . 
If the job gets done the right way , then you 'll head to Osaka ... 
I know . I understand how you feel . 
I swear I didn 't betray Kang ! 
Kang Seongmin 's the one who betrayed us ! 
He 's the one who manipulated the Sineui Alliance ! 
You 're right , he did . 
All right ? Of course I know that . And yet Yoon Palbong deserves to die for what he did . 
You know , don 't you ? 
There was an opportunity in Busan , wasn 't there ? 
If Yoon Palbong hadn 't killed An Minchul , Kang Seongmin wouldn 't be the mess that he is now . 
Yoon Palbong . Who brought him to us ? 
Uncle Samsik , was it you ? 
There is someone I detest . 
Look , I 'm sorry . 
Back then , I thought he was showing his loyalty . 
Kang Seongmin . 
What are you planning to do with him ? 
I 'll have to stop him , and end his political career . 
He has to be stopped before he even gets close to being president . 
Go and get your freedom in Osaka . 
I have evidence that Seongmin was an active member of the Sineui Alliance . 
This is where Kang and I formed the Sineui Alliance . 
We created the rules , regulations , and even homemade bombs . 
Wow , this is so old , it 's ... 
It 's hard to say exactly who it is . 
MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS 
In the major cities , Choo Intae has absolutely taken the lead . 
We must curb his rise . 
And how do we do that ? 
You people aren 't here to write reviews ! 
And the Local Government Act ? 
We 'll start off by ... by holding a public hearing ... 
Public hearing ? What ? 
Do you all have time to waste ? 
Am I the only one concerned ? 
Get everyone 's help on this . Everyone . Military , civil servants . 
Yes , yes . I 'll find out and get back to you . 
- They 're all having a field day . 
They need to be threatened . 
There 's lots of opposition within the party , sir . 
The longer we take , the more we have to lose . 
Steal it from under their noses if we have to . 
Go and see Assemblyman Pak . 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
You 've seen the export price Sanae Produce has requested , is that so ? 
Yes . They 've requested flour as the form of payment . 
Flour . 
- No objections ? - No . All right then . We 'll leave it there . 
Well done today . 
Jiwook ? 
Stop dozing off during meetings . 
Boring , isn 't it ? 
All this about imports and payments . Gosh , it really gives me a headache . 
We need to get our Mister Pak back to doing what he does best . 
We need to get the Local Government Act passed quickly . 
Seems to be a lot of people opposed to it . 
And that 's exactly why we need your help . 
What ? Whatever for ? 
Our time 's running out . 
Hello . 
It 's been a while . 
- It 's been a long time . - It 's good to see you , man . 
Let 's head inside . 
Boss . We 're here . 
- How have you been ? Good ? 
Yeah , yeah . It 's been a while . 
How have you been spending your time ? 
I left the police force and I started a business for a while but gave that up . 
You all seem like you 're a little worse off now than before . 
We 're all barely surviving . 
We 'll take any job you 've got . 
Why didn 't you go to the Innovation Party when Choo Intae had a high approval rating ? Why 'd you take the chairman position of the Democratic Party Economic Policy Committee ? 
Because of Samsik ? 
Hey , look who it is . 
Will you stop coming here trying to win me over with stuff to eat ? 
Oh , I bought this for me . 
You want some of it ? 
Why are you here ? 
Have you ever heard of Sun Wooseok of the new faction ? 
I know who he is . 
Right . Well , this Sun Wooseok , cannot say the word " no " to me . 
Why is that ? 
' Cause the guy has accepted so many of my bribes . 
Anyway , if you join the Democrats through Sun , join their new faction , I can make you their Economic Policy Committee chair . You 'll be in charge of pledges for the election . 
This is the last time I 'm coming to ask . 
If you don 't want it , tell me now . 
A couple of radishes , some potatoes , add some scallions , minced garlic , some chili powder , let it simmer and enjoy . 
Nothing better on cold nights like these . 
- Forget it . 
- Please enjoy it . 
They 're also good grilled . 
So , I read through the National Reconstruction Plan of yours , huh ? You really think you got a shot ? 
Well , with large-scale loans and investments ... 
There are so many in America willing to invest . 
And I personally know a lot of these people . They 've been calling me about it non-stop . 
We must push for US economic agreement ... 
Yes , the economic agreement . You know what that is , don 't you ? 
You really think I don 't know what that is ? 
I 'll explain it . 
Oh , yeah . Go ahead , go ahead . 
The Korean Government needs to show interest in attracting foreign capital . 
Foreign capital has zero confidence in Rhee Seungmin 's government . 
We need a new economic policy if America 's gonna have any faith in us . 
Ah , so you 're saying we do what those Liberal Party jerks can 't do ? 
That 's it . That 's exactly it ! 
You 're finally understanding everything . 
Oh , but wait . In our party , there 's Yoon Bohyun 's old faction and Jang Min 's new faction . 
I 'm aware of that . 
We need to make sure that these policies are initiated by the new faction . 
Yes , we 've got to . 
That way , those of us in the new faction will support you . 
We 're gonna need that whiskey the Assemblyman 's so fond of . Yes , sir . 
Look at us , finally on the same page , huh ? 
Hey , you know Kim San , right ? Don 't you ? 
Come over and say hello . 
December 31 , 1959 Seoul , South Korea 
US Army club 
Hanmin ! 
- Kwangmin 's here . - Hey . 
Hey , how did it go ? 
Economic Policy Committee chair . 
- Sorry about last time . 
- It 's all right . 
Congratulations . You 'll be an assemblyman , huh ? 
And now we drink . 
- Here 's to death . 
- Cheers . Cheers ! 
I 'm gonna drink a lot tonight . 
Hey , order another round . 
- Let 's just go for it . 
- Five , - four , three , two , one ! - Four , three , two , one ! 
Happy New Year ! 
This feels like when we studied abroad . Yeah , it does . 
So don 't you think that with you in the Democratic Party , it 'll upset Yeojin ? 
I might not have made the right choice . 
- San . - Hmm ? 
Do you trust Uncle Samsik ? 
- Why ? 
- I 'm not sure , I guess ... 
It 's going so well , I 'm getting nervous . 
Stand down ! You will stand down . 
On your stomach ! 
- On our stomach ! - Roll over . 
- Kwangmin . What about Uncle Samsik ... - Turn everything in South Korea upside down ! 
... is making you nervous ? 
- Huh ? - Turn the whole thing upside down ! 
Hey , where ... 
where are you going ? 
Wait , stop . Stop right there . 
Stop right there ! 
Sir ! 
They look great . 
Now distribute these around the Innovation Party locations . 
Yes , sir . Let 's go . 
Here . 
CHAIRMAN OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE KIM SAN 
Where 're the others ? 
I can 't reach anyone . 
Tonight , Yoon Palbong ... finally goes down . 
Do you want in on this ? 
I 've wanted this for a very long time now . 
All right . 
Is Cha Taemin prepared ? 
- Yes . 
- What did he say ? 
He says he wants to be sure to kill Yoon Palbong himself . 
That 's good . Make it happen as soon as possible . 
Yes , sir . 
What did Kang Seongmin say ? 
I told you to stop coming here . 
You told him about the Innovation Party , right ? 
We can 't be seen together ever again . God , what did he say ? 
That you did good . 
You stay right next to Choo and really embrace this spy role . 
Did he mention having me killed ? 
What do you mean ? 
You 're the key to bringing down Choo Intae . 
Look at you , Yoon Palbong . Huh ? You helped someone become an assemblyman and saved his life . I told you , do what I say and you 'll be fine . You see ? 
I should 've known , Samsik . 
You 've got a great mind . 
I got a lot of great things , but especially a great mind . 
Samsik , thank you . Thank you so much . 
I 'll go now . 
Don 't you ever come back here . 
Right . 
I 'll never come back here . Ever . 
What do you want ? What now ? 
Well , Mr. Kang . 
I guess you were in the area . 
That was Yoon Palbong , wasn 't it ? 
When are you gonna have him killed ? 
My father gave you a lot of bread back in the day . 
You used to be so efficient . But now ... you 're so slow . Are you just getting old ? 
Or could it be ... you 're hiding something from me ? 
You are , aren 't you ? 
Tell me . It stays between us . 
Yoon Palbong has ... just joined the Innovation Party . 
His reason ? 
He thought if he were next to Choo Intae , he 'd be safer . 
That 's good . 
What ? 
We can kill Choo Intae while we 're at it . 
Sir , don 't ... don 't say that . 
I 'm the one who chooses the target , and you find the means . 
I 'm joking . 
Killing Choo at the wrong time would be catastrophic . 
I want you to take care of it , Uncle . 
Properly . 
Yes , sir . 
Yeojin , why does your dad want to become the president ? 
Is it good to be president ? 
Well , he doesn 't want to become president because it 's good , that 's not it . 
He just wants to create a world where you can do or be anything that you dream of when you grow up . 
That 's why he wants to do it . 
- Yeojin . 
- Uncle San . 
Yeojin 's been waiting here for you forever . 
What brings you all this way ? 
I hadn 't heard from you in a few days . 
I 've been a little busy . 
My father keeps getting approached by people who just want to flatter him . He just hears what he wants to hear . 
And I 'm afraid my father will change who he is . 
Are there no other options ? 
If we join with the Democratic Party , it could make it easier . 
No . The Democratic Party 's in no position for that . 
Well , would you know anybody who works there ? 
I like seeing you this way . 
Choo Intae ! 
- Choo Intae ! 
- Go away ! 
- Choo Intae ! - The Democratic Party ! 
What 's going on ? 
What do you think you 're doing ? Stop ! Stop ! 
The country needs the Democratic Party ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Who wants to challenge us ? 
Choo Intae ! 
KIM SAN , DEMOCRATIC PARTY 'S ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN 
Choo Intae ! 
It 's just policy research ... 
At the Democratic Party ? 
Have you joined them ? 
I can 't get into the details at the moment , but ... in my position ... 
I 'm not able to explain myself . 
I guess I always knew ... this day would come eventually . 
I understand . 
Choo Intae as president Politics for the people 
Innovation is the only way forward ! Innovation is the only way forward ! 
Peaceful unification is the only way forward ! Peaceful unification is the only way forward ! 
We cannot live this way ! Let 's make changes . We cannot live this way ! 
Voting for change ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Thank you all ! 
Thank you ! 
Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
Now , ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Mister Choo Intae 's daughter ! 
- Choo Yeojin ! - Choo Yeojin ! Choo Yeojin ! 
- Let 's go . 
- Choo Yeojin ! 
Choo Yeojin ! 
So , what did you discuss with my father ? 
He wants me to join the Innovation Party . 
Did you give him an answer ? 
Well , I said I 'd think about it . 
Should we postpone our wedding ? 
Do you think there might be a position for me in the Innovation Party ? 
So you want to get into politics ? 
Does this mean you 're joining the party ? 
I 'm thinking about it . 
There 's really no need to force it . 
My father keeps getting approached by people who just want to flatter him . 
And I 'm afraid my father will change who he is . 
Are there no other options ? 
If we join with the Democratic Party , it could make it easier . 
No . The Democratic Party 's in no position for that . 
Well , would you know anybody who works there ? 
I like seeing you this way . 
Jina likes this one , doesn 't she ? 
Oh , you don 't have to do that for Jina . 
Uh , I think this is the one she likes , right ? 
Oh , it 's this one . 
- Can we have a bag of these here ? 
- Oh , sure . 
I 'd prefer it ... if you stayed out of politics , actually . 
Is that selfish to ask ? 
Choo Yeojin ! Choo Yeojin ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Thank you ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! 
Thank you , everyone ! 
Thank you ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Innovation is the only way forward ! 
I will be with you until the very end ! 
Please excuse me . Yeojin . 
We will win the election and make lasting changes . 
Why are you here ? 
Sorry for intruding like this . 
Can you please give me a moment ? 
We 'll do this later . 
What is it ? 
I intend to do whatever it takes to support Mister Choo Intae . 
And being with the Democratic Party won 't change that . 
Is that what you came here to say ? 
I admire and support Mister Choo Intae . 
So can you go out there and declare that you 're Choo Intae 's son-in-law ? Can you say that you support the Innovation Party ? 
That you 're done with the Democratic Party ? 
Yes , of course . 
Yeojin . I love you very much and I 'm sure you know that . 
I have this dream . 
What dream is that ? 
There 's a version of South Korea ... that I want to create . 
Except that 's not a real dream . 
That 's hypocrisy . 
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream . 
Choo Intae ! 
Hey , you sons of bitches ! 
Yeojin ! 
Yeojin ! 
Yeojin !
