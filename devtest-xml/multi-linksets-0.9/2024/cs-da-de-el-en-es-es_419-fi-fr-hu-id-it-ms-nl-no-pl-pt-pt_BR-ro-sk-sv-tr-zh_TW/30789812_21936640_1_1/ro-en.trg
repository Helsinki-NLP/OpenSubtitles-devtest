It 's out of love and respect that everybody calls me 
Samsik , brother Samsik , Uncle Samsik ... 
and I just love it . My nickname , I mean . 
Capital Defense Unit , Secret Bunker 
It 's a standard investigation . If you cooperate , it shouldn 't take too long . 
Good to see you here ... Colonel . 
Hanmin . 
San , is that you ? 
You 're here too ? 
San ! 
We didn 't plan any of this ! 
This was all Samsik , not us ! 
Tell them , please ! 
Tell them it was all Samsik ! It 's not us ! 
You knew Pak Doochill , the CEO of Sail Developments ? 
Yes , I know him . 
You called him Samsik , right ? 
I did . 
What does it mean , Samsik ? 
He made sure everyone had three meals even during the war . 
" Sam " means three . " Sik " means food . Three meals . He doesn 't let anyone go hungry . 
Uncle Samsik 
Uncle Samsik 
Three Meals a Day 
November 26 , 1959 Seoul , South Korea 
US Army , Oil Storage Facility 
- Two ? 
- Two . - 20,000 hwan . - For the oil . 
What 's " oil " in English ? 
That 's 10 bills . 
Oil . 
That 's 20,000 hwan . 
That 's 20,000 hwan . 
A little bit more , a little bit more . 
What the fuck is he saying ? 
- Get out ! Get out of here ! 
- Run ! 
What was that ? 
Gu Haejun and Han Soo Seodaemun Gang 
Shit . 
November 30 , 1959 Seoul , South Korea 
Rhee Seungmin to run for reelection 
We must protect our president ! 
That 's the thing about Samsik , you know , he 's got connections everywhere . 
And those guys in Gunsan got caught smuggling Japanese radios , - Samsik got them all out there too . 
- Yeah , you said that already . 
Oh , did I ? 
Hey , don 't talk back to me , you little brat . 
I heard everyone got turned over to the CIC . 
How much longer we got to wait ? 
Hey , keep it down ! Hey , don 't , I 'm serious . 
He will see you now . 
Our hope ! 
Our hope ! 
We want Rhee ! We want Rhee ! 
Retract it ! Retract it ! 
Come in . 
We want Rhee ! We want Rhee ! 
Uncle Samsik ? 
We support the president 's reelection ! 
We support ! We support ! 
Come in , come in . Here . 
So , you 're with the Soedaemun gang ? - Yes . 
- You stole oil from US troops ? 
Yeah , now , our boys are being held at the CIC . 
Why the CIC ? 
I 'm not sure , the Counter Intelligence Corps ... 
Over in Osaka , thugs don 't have to hide , they drive around freely . And then we have you two who are doing nothing more than just a little petty theft . 
Don 't you think you should try something a bit more decent ? 
Just tell us . Can you get our guys out of there or not ? 
And if I can ? 
We 'll pay you well . 
You 're pretty cocky for someone trying to ask a favor . 
Let 's go . Hey , come on , man ! 
Let 's go ! 
- Hey , Han Soo ! - Let 's go ! 
Look at you . 
Leaving just like that ? 
Hey , how about you try calling me Uncle Samsik ? 
Call you what ? 
Try it , try calling me Uncle Samsik . 
Why should I ? 
Because I 'll feed you . 
I won 't pretend you 're family just to get fed . 
All right . You know Yoon Palbong with the Dongdaemun gang ? 
I can give you his turf . 
But Yoon Palbong is with the Liberal Party . - How could we ... 
- I 'm saying I could give it to you . 
- Miss Kim , bring me 10 envelopes . - Yes ? 
I 'm giving you this money and you 're going to break Yoon Palbong 's legs . 
Protests continue throughout the country expressing opposition to President Rhee 's withdrawal of his candidacy for reelection . 
Political circles are closely following the protests and are waiting to see whether President Rhee ... - Let 's go , Jina . 
- ... and run for reelection . 
Jina . 
Uncle , is your report going to help our country get better ? 
You just focus on your studies , hmm ? 
Put your shoes on . 
We 're off . See you later . 
- Have a nice day . 
- Let 's go . 
- Bye , Jina . Study hard . - Okay . 
Ministry of Home Affairs 
National Reconstruction Bureau . Oh , hello . 
Mr. Kim . 
- Yes ? Phone call , sir . 
Who is it ? 
Hello , this is Manager Kim . 
- Hello , San . 
- Yeojin . 
Hi , are you free to talk ? 
Yes , I 'm free . 
Listen , I don 't want you to come today . 
I 've been noticing a lot of suspicious people lurking around . 
Wait , what do you mean ? 
I 'll come right after work . Don 't worry about it . 
I 'll see you later . 
- Oh , Mr. Kim , the minister 's here . Hurry . - Great . - Be right there . 
- Come on . Hurry ! 
Miss Kim . Site for Seohae Oil Factory 
Yes ? 
Can you see ... the Seohae Oil factory from there ? 
- I can . - Mm . 
Once that 's in place , I 'll be an official member of the Cheongwoo Federation . 
You understand what that means , right ? 
You 'll be a South Korean nobility ? 
South Korean nobility ? Please . 
I 'll be the one reigning over the nobility . Huh ? 
Hurry . Let 's go . 
San , hurry ! 
- They 're almost here ! Let 's go , come on ! - Okay , I 'm coming . 
General Jang Doosik is heading to Taepyeonggak . 
Why does he insist to calling me over ? To watch him pig out ? 
Boy , you sure did a fine job with those shoes . 
Yoon Palbong 's coming . 
- Let 's go , just go . 
Don 't look . - Hey , Samsik ! 
Damn it , Samsik ! 
Well , well , well . Well , if it isn 't Yoon Palbong . Good day to you . 
I 've called up 25 of my men for later . 
Ah , good . How reassuring . Huh ? 
Did you talk to Kang Seongmin ? Oh , of course . 
- Hey . 
- Hey now , people are watching . 
- Hey , just give me a straight answer . 
- Come on , they 're looking . If what we did in Busan ever comes out , the three of us are dead . 
If I don 't get the Dongdaemun nomination , I won 't take it lying down . 
Have you gone insane ? 
I told you to stop bringing up Busan . 
I 'll stop when Kang Seongmin keeps his promise . 
And why are you being so impatient ? 
Listen , he surely has everything handled . So , don 't worry . 
- Then why is he avoiding me ? 
- You keep visiting him uninvited . 
Listen , don 't forget what we did for Kang Seongmin , okay ? Were we ever rewarded for it ? 
I 'll be at the Innovation Party 's speech to show you what I 'm made of . 
So you tell him that this is his last warning . 
That bastard 's stepping out of line . 
You told the police to pull out , right ? 
Yes , I made the call . 
Get ready to be humiliated today . 
Let 's begin . 
The unemployment rate has sharply increased due to the collapse of farms , small manufacturers , and traders . 
The agricultural surpluses from USAID are fueling farming debt . 
80 % of which is in private loans with annual interest rates of over 6 % . The agricultural economy is on the brink of collapse . 
Now with South Korea 's abundant young workforce ... 
The president is asking for you . 
Is he running for reelection ? 
He said he 's not sure yet . 
- That 's all for today . 
- Sir , - we 've barely started the briefing . 
- It can wait . 
Our team spent all night putting it together . 
Who is that guy ? 
He 's manager Kim San from the National Reconstruction Bureau . 
Minister Choi . 
The way forward for South Korea ... is laid out here . 
Why is he so cocky ? 
Well , he studied economics in the US . He was also an Albright scholar , sir . 
- Albright ? - Yes . 
- Were you in the military ? - Yes , that 's right . 
What 's a military academy grad doing here ? 
You couldn 't adjust to it ? 
Minister Choi , the president is waiting for you . 
Submit the report again . 
We 've already submitted several . 
- But ... we 'll resubmit it . 
- We 've been doing that for two years . 
Right now , the president 's reelection is our top priority . 
Why is that your priority ? 
Unemployment is through the roof , agriculture is falling apart , this country can 't do anything without American aid . 
- Is he out of his mind or what ? 
Minister , please just give us an hour . 
Minister Choi . 
Minister Choi ! 
Please just give us one hour ! 
Oh , God . 
We 've been running reports for two years . 
Taepyeonggak 
♪ Waterfowl ♪ 
♪ Why are you crying ♪ 
♪ Do not resent the time ♪ ♪ That flies by ... ♪ 
Bunch of rookies . 
Why did he bring the whole flock here ? 
I wonder . 
♪ Leaving only the green mountains ♪ 
Hey , Samsik . 
How strange . This bottle 's gone lower . 
It was up to here . 
Why is a general hanging around with a bunch of rookies , huh ? 
A general should treat his men to food and booze in order to gain their respect , ain 't that right ? 
But I pay for their booze , don 't I ? 
Are you close with Hong Youngki , the head of CIC ? 
Hong Youngki ? 
Why ? 
Uh , my nephew got caught stealing oil from US troops and the CIC detained him . 
You want me to get him out ? 
Yes , I do . 
You 're making a general do menial task , huh ? 
I made you a general precisely so you could do such task . 
Don 't you know what Hong Youngki is like ? 
If he would get a hold of you , it doesn 't matter what rank you are . 
Just last year ... he got a third of all our generals stripped of their badges . 
How 's that ? On what grounds ? 
Well , you 're a commie if Hong Youngki says you 're a commie . 
He goes and cooks up some evidence and you 're behind bars . 
- I guess he and I are similar then . 
- How so ? Well , you just said he can get generals dismissed . Why would someone like that bother with petty thieves ? 
- He wants to use them as bait . 
- Bait ? 
Go and meet Hong Youngki . 
Are you insane ? 
Why would you argue with the minister ? Might as well punch the guy in the face ! 
If you want to go rogue , then get into politics ! 
Go and be a politician like Choo Intae ! 
Go and run a campaign , give speeches ! 
- I 'm going to . 
- What ? I 'm giving a speech at the current affairs talk later . 
A civil servant , speaking in front of the Innovation Party ? 
Mr. Choo Intae is like a father to me . 
Well , he 's not your real father , kid . 
- So stay out of there . Hey ! - I 'm heading out . 
You 're still on the clock ! 
I 'm done writing reports . 
Stop writing them . 
Office of the President Office of the President 
I 've served three terms as president of this country . 
Well , it is what the people want , sir . 
I already withdrew my candidacy . 
If I go back on my word ... " President " ... they 'll surely criticize me . 
Have you seen Choo Intae 's approval rating ? 
So , do you actually think I could beat him ? 
Yes , sir . I 'm certain . I 'll use any means necessary to get you elected . 
You 'll use any means necessary ? 
Yes . 
You can count on me . 
Banya Hotel 
Right . The Cheongwoo Federation ... 
Hello . 
Ah , right . Keep it up . Here . 
" Thanks to the guidance of the Cheongwoo Federation members . I ... I 'm here at this distinguished event today . 
This honorable ... " How corny . 
So ? 
Are you ready ? 
Honestly , I 'm nervous . 
Well , congratulations . 
Not everyone gets inducted into the Cheongwoo Federation . 
You 're one of the top businessmen in the whole country . 
" Thanks to An Yosub 's guidance , I have the honor of ... " I now have the honor of standing here before you . Yes . 
As soon as our industrial complex is finished ... we all will be eating pizza like the Americans . 
Pizza . I 'm sure that none of you have heard of it . 
Ah , it 's extraordinary . 
Come on , this is taking too long . 
So , since he 's acquired us 60 % stake in Seohae Oil , I believe we can officially welcome our new member Samsik . No , Mr. Pak Doochill , I mean . 
All in favor of accepting our new member ? 
Petron Harvest , Sierra Union , Hassel Chemistry ... 
All eight companies that agreed to the partnership have given the same response . 
Payment guarantees from the Korean government , the right to use port facilities , the right to manage railways , and they want diplomatic status for their staff at the complex ? 
It 's like they want to call off the deal ! 
An Kichul An Yosub 's youngest son 
Hey , do you know what pizza is ? 
I doubt it . 
They use an oven that 's wider than your bedroom to bake bread bigger than you are . 
And you add meat , cheese , vegetables . 
You take one bite , and ... 
Ah , you probably haven 't heard of cheese either . 
Cheese ? Cheese is like bread , right ? Man , oh , man , oh , man ! Look at you , it 's so obvious you 're a blue-collar worker . 
Yoo Yeonchul , how are you in the Cheongwoo Federation , huh ? 
People in America , they eat that bread daily . 
- And most of them don 't even eat it all . 
Once the industrial complex is complete , then we 'll have bread like theirs and we 'll throw out the rest . 
There must be some reason they 're suddenly doing this . Think about all the money we poured into this ! 
Isn 't that a bit strange that all at once , all eight are making the same demand ? 
I 'll look into possible motives right away , sir . 
Kang Seongmin . 
Bring him right now . 
Yes , sir . 
Yeah , the day is coming soon . 
Hey , how 'd it go ? 
What 's going on ? 
Petron Harvest is now ... making certain demands . Huh ? What demands ? 
I don 't understand all this . What does it say ? 
A payment guarantee from the government , the right to use port facilities , and the right to audit government grants . 
Uh , but why all of a sudden ? 
Well , these bastards , they just can 't trust the Korean government . 
Well then , what 's next ? 
I have no idea . It could mean it 's the end . 
Am I ... 
I 'm still a Cheongwoo Federation member , aren 't I ? 
If there 's no Seohae Oil , then it sounds like the show is over . 
Hey , hey , get out , get out , get out . 
Kang Seongmin . 
Why is it so hard to reach you ? 
I thought I told you to stay away . 
You heard about the Innovation Party speech today ? 
We 're about to send 25 of our men . 
So I 'm asking you to acknowledge what we 've done . 
Fine . 
We 'll speak after the election . 
The Dongdaemun nomination , there 's a rumor it 's going to some other guy . 
Keep your promises and don 't just use people . 
Yosub will be there , won 't he ? 
I wonder how he 'll react if he finds out who killed An Minchul in Busan . Should I tell him who killed his son ? 
Kang Seongmin Liberal Party Assemblyman 
We 've come all this way with a single goal in mind . 
So we have to think of something fast . 
Oh , welcome . 
Samsik , a word . 
Hey , what 's the matter ? What 's going on ? 
Yoon Palbong approached me again just a second ago . 
Huh ? 
That idiot showed up again ? 
I thought I 'd gotten through to him earlier . 
I will have to teach him a proper lesson at the Innovation Party speech later . 
- Don 't you worry about him . 
- Kill him . 
Huh ? 
Kill Yoon Palbong . 
Quickly . 
I 'm so afraid . 
I keep seeing An Minchul in my dreams . 
Assemblyman , that brat Yoon Palbong , all he 's ever wanted is a national assembly badge . 
- Can 't you just give it to him ? 
- Please kill him . Do you want to watch me worry myself to death ? 
Right . 
As you wish . 
Uncle Samsik , you 're the only one I can count on . 
Please help me get some sleep at night . 
The eight partnering companies sent us these demands all at once . 
Why all of a sudden ? 
They distrust the Korean government . 
Why on earth ... did I let you join the national assembly ? 
If Minchul was still alive right now ... he would be sitting there instead of you . He would 've done well far better than you . 
Kang Seongmin has ordered me to kill Yoon Palbong . 
Why ? 
He keeps mentioning what we did in Busan together . That lunatic . And how we killed An Yosub 's son . 
Do you think the president will run for reelection ? 
- It 's not certain just yet . 
- He definitely will . 
He even went so far as to hire those filthy protesters . 
I will look into it . 
You 're always one step behind . 
Our industrial complex is slipping away from us here . 
That bastard Kang Seongmin is another coward . 
He 's not satisfied until the people he fears are killed . 
He wants you to do it ? 
I 'll be the next one . 
Those with power and with money will do everything they can to stay out of the mud while wearing their best shoes . 
Why do you think he 's asked me to kill Yoon Palbong ? 
I 've known Kang Seongmin a long time since he was born . 
He gets this look as if he could murder somebody without batting an eye . 
He had it when he told us to kill An Minchul . 
And he had it again just now . 
Just wait . 
I 'm all but certain that he 'll try to kill me next . 
Petron Harvest apparently sent an inspection team to the Philippines . 
They 're trying to take our business there ? Are they out of their minds ? 
They sent an inspection team , it 's not out of the question . 
We can 't let someone else reap our rewards . 
Choi Minkyu has been dragging his feet too long and now it 's all ruined ! 
I 'll meet with Mr. Choi Minkyu , sir . 
Go now ! Tell him we 'll give him whatever he wants . 
Yeojin . 
San , why are you here so early ? 
The preparations are going well ? 
Well , I 'm doing my best , but I 'm not so sure . 
This is the first time Father will be speaking to a large crowd . 
Don 't worry about it . 
I 'm sure he 'll do great . 
Allow me to escort you , Minister . 
Seonyoowon 
Minister Choi Minkyu has just arrived . 
He 's arrived at Seonyoowon . 
Yoon Palbong is sending 25 of his guys to the Innovation Party event . So he can cause a scene and ruin the speech . 
It 's what Yoon Palbong has been doing for the past decade . 
He always targets opposition party politicians under someone else 's orders . 
How many men do you have ? 
Right , we have around 15 men , sir . 
You think they are able to hold back 25 ? 
Haejun , Heesung , and I will be inside the hall . 
And Jongsol , you look out , when the Dongdaemun guys arrive , just run them down with the truck . Add more chili powder . 
I 'm not worried about taking on 25 men , but what happens after that , sir ? 
What will happen is we 'll be the ones to get arrested , not the Dongdaemun guys . 
I guess we 'll need to get rid of the police . 
Can you keep the police away ? 
Retreat . 
Of course I can . 
Han Soo , hey , look , the police are all retreating . 
- All of them ? 
- Yeah . 
Yeah , good , we can handle those 25 men . 
Yoon Palbong is our prime target . 
You better make damn sure to break that bastard 's legs , huh ? 
There will be a lot of people attending Choo Intae 's speech . 
A lot of politicians . All kinds of people will be there . They 're all trying to befriend Choo Intae . 
He 's more popular than the president right now . If he runs for office , he 's sure to win . 
No wonder he 's being targeted . 
Choo Intae Innovation Party Leader 
Innovation Party 's Speech 
Peaceful reunification and our nation 's path by Choo Intae 
Now , let us begin the current affairs address , hosted by the Innovation Party . 
Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
Thank you . 
I am Choo Intae . 
A question . What is the way forward for our country ? 
The answer , first of all , peaceful unification , and second of all , peaceful unification . It is the peaceful coexistence of South and North Korea . 
Hear , hear ! 
What has the current administration done for the people of South Korea ? 
Nothing . All the president 's done is impoverish our country , bringing suffering to farmers and workers . 
Hear , hear ! 
Hey ! 
Get in there , you fucker . 
Good fucking luck . 
The incumbent president has been putting on a little show by withdrawing his candidacy . 
Who on earth could possibly fall for his tricks ? 
That 's right ! 
There will still be five or six Dongdaemun guys in the hall . 
Can you stop them on your own ? 
Of course . As long as you give me their turf ... Uncle Samsik . 
This incumbent is shameless enough ... 
Let 's go . 
... to ask for yet another term as president . 
It is his goal to wage another war and reach unification with violence ! 
Once again flooding these lands with the blood of innocent people . 
You 'll take on 100 each , each of you . 
If you go down , take three with you ! 
We cannot wage yet another war on these lands . Never again , everyone ! 
Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
Choo Intae is a commie ! 
Hey ! 
You motherfuckers ! 
Let 's go . 
Someone get the police in here ! 
- Hey ! - What are you doing ? 
Call the cops . Huh ? 
Call the fucking cops right now . 
Shit or get off the pot , alright ? 
I got it done , huh ? 
Let 's go . 
Wait a minute , has Mr. Choo Intae already run away ? 
That lilly-liver little commie . Can 't handle politics , huh ? 
No , he can 't . 
Excuse me . 
- Are you talking to me ? 
- Who are you ? 
That 's Pak Jiwook of the Liberal Party . You should stop . 
Ah , calm down , Assemblyman . 
Calm down . 
Who do you think you are interrupting an assemblyman ? 
Mr. Choo Intae is not a commie . 
- Apologize right now . - What ? 
He aspires to bring the people peaceful coexistence and prosperity . 
Well , that 's precisely what we call a commie , boy . 
Do you have any idea what kind of man he is ? 
Have you read Co-prosperity on the Korean Peninsula ? 
It 's a detailed exploration of the prosperity of a nation . 
Do you know it , sir ? I bet you don 't . 
- No , you punk . - Well ... may I explain it to you ? 
- Be my guest . 
- Thank you , sir . 
Let 's hear what he has to say . 
This is where I come when I want to relax , think , or just be alone . 
Feel free to come here , have a drink . Whenever you need a moment to yourself . 
Is this about the Cheongwoo complex ? 
I can 't help you . 
The president 's opposed to it . 
He thinks a planned economy is something only commies do . 
Hello , everyone . 
I work at the Reconstruction Bureau . Prior to this , I received a doctorate in economics . 
I was an Albright scholar at an American university . 
During my time in America , there was beauty and abundance everywhere I 'd look . Meanwhile , my countrymen were stripped bare and starving . 
Do you know what pizza is ? 
Has anyone tried it ? 
Mr. Pak , have you tried it , sir ? 
No , I haven 't , boy . 
During my time abroad , I lived above a pizza shop and couldn 't afford a single proper meal a day . 
Every day , I smelled pizzas baking . Every night , it kept me up . 
Listen , the economy matters more than guns . 
I saw a country where no one worried about food , where you can have three decent meals every day . 
What I envied during my studies abroad wasn 't their fighter jets or aircraft carriers . It was pi ... it was pizza . 
What is the point of winning a war when the entire nation is starving to death ? 
That 's why Mr. Choo Intae said that I should study economics . 
Steel , shipbuilding , transport , chemical , oil , and textiles . 
All the key industries a country needs . 
They 're each putting their life on the line for this complex . 
If we don 't act quickly , the overseas partners we 'll go do business with the Philippines and Taiwan . 
We can 't afford any further investments in facilities . 
We poured everything we have into this industrial complex . 
If we can 't secure foreign capital , all the money we 've put down ... it all goes down the drain . 
So if the government were to help us out here ... 
What ? 
You 'll help us with the presidential election ? 
Yes . 
The president and Mr. An Yosub are well into their eighties now . 
How much longer do you think they 'll hold on to power ? 
My time will come soon . 
After that ... yours could too . You understand ? 
With your wealth and background and my political power , 
imagine what we could do if we share what we have ? 
I believe ... we 'd be invincible . 
Right . I think so too . 
Use this election to your advantage and take control of the party . 
Become the chairman of the campaign committee . 
All I need to do is speak to the president . 
And I could give you the chance to reign over the Liberal Party . 
So ... what are you asking for in return ? 
Do you have anything ... aside from the Cheongwoo Federation ? 
Now take a look . 
Seoul and Busan will be connected by a new expressway and we 'll build industrial complexes and ports . Seoul and Incheon could connect too , and we 'd ship our goods all the way to China . 
If the 700 million people in China each buy one pair of shoes , we can sell 1.4 billion shoes to them . 
Hey , smart-ass . 
Why on earth would we sell shoes to the damn Chinese ? 
That 's the kind of ideal only a commie would have . 
- Exactly , yeah ! - That 's right ! 
Don 't commies wear shoes too ? 
The Republic of Korea can use its young and abundant workforce to become an industrialized nation . 
With our peninsular position , we could become the next center of trade . 
That is exactly the kind of nation ... that Mr. Choo Intae dreams of . 
Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae !
