Sir , we will deal with the Busan district electorates . 
Why don 't we change the subject ? 
What are you reading ? 
An Minchul , Liberal Party Assemblyman An Yosub 's eldest son 
You like history books ? 
Kang Seongmin , aged 16 
Why bother reading about kings ? 
A prince only has two options in life . 
He either becomes his father 's lackey , or he kills his father so he can take the throne . 
Which would you choose ? 
I don 't like either option . 
Hey . 
Yes ? 
Come here . 
Weren 't you taught to respect your elders , you punk ? 
If you don 't want to be king , you 've got to be someone 's servant . 
You brat ! 
What do you think you 're doing ? 
I 'm sorry , Mr. An . 
Your son 's quite a feisty one . 
He 's the one who hit me first ! 
It doesn 't matter . 
He hit me first though , I swear . 
Daddy , where are you going ? 
Oh , my goodness ! 
Who are you , darling ? 
Oh , that depressing little bastard . He 'sâ  ¦ he 'sâ  ¦ 
Is he your son , oppa ? 
He 's quite the cutie . 
Ah , so depressing ! 
I heard this is where your mom killed herself . 
Don 't glare if you 're going to look away . 
What the hell ? 
Mr. Kang , your son almost killed you . 
You little shit . Come here . 
Come with me , you bastard . 
Goddammit ! Come here ! 
You dirty bastard ! 
You still don 't get it , do you ? You 're a worthless piece of shit ! 
Just like your mother !

Hypocrisy Disguised as a Dream 
Kim San joins the Democratic Party as Head of the Economic Policy Committee 
Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! 
- Choo Intae ! 
- Thank you , everyone ! 
- Thank you all ! 
- Choo Intae ! 
Choo Intae ! 
Innovation is the only way forward ! 
- Choo Intae ! - Choo Intae ! 
Please , excuse me . 
Yeojin . 
We will win the election ! 
- Why are you here ? 
- I 'm sorry for intruding like this . Can you please give me a moment ? 
We 'll do this later . 
What is it ? 
I intend to do whatever it takes to support Mr. Choo Intae . 
And being with the Democratic Party won 't change that . 
Is that what you came here to say ? 
I admire and support Mr. Choo Intae . 
So can you go out there and declare that you 're Choo Intae 's son-in-law ? 
Can you say that you support the Innovation Party ? 
That you 're done with the Democratic Party ? 
Yes , of course . 
Yeojin . I love you very much , and I 'm sure you know that . 
I have this dream . 
What dream is that ? 
There 's a version of South Koreaâ  ¦ that I want to create . 
Except that 's not a real dream . 
That 's hypocrisy . 
Hypocrisy dressed as a dream . 
Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! Choo Intae ! 
Hey , you sons of bitches ! 
Yeojin ! 
- Yeojin ! 
Heyâ  ¦ 
Yeojin ! 
Are you all right ? 
Bring him some water . 
Why 'd you come back here ? 
To see Choo Yeojin ? 
- Yeah , but I still need to explain to herâ  ¦ why I joined the Democratic Party , don 't I ? 
You came here to tell her that with all these people around to see you ? 
I 'm going to stop , starting now . 
I 've justâ  ¦ promised Yeojin so many things that I need to keep my word to her . 
Yeah , and what about the promises you made to me ? 
What , ' cause Choo is like your father , and Samsik is just an uncle ? 
Who is he to you ? Who is he to you ? 
What has that man ever done for you ? 
Noble politicians . Yeah . 
Were they able to feed their children during the war ? 
Choo Yeojin isn 't going to be some politician 's wife . 
Why aren 't you smart enough to get that ? 
It 's still not enough to break things off with her like this . 
Why not ? 
- Because it 's cowardly . 
I refuse to let her see me as a coward ! 
So you want more money , and you want more power , and you want all this respect , and you want to be the good guy . 
That 's not how it works , you can 't have it all . 
Yeah , well , I quit . 
You 're clearly not ready for this yet . 
I can give you all the money and power you 'd like . But if you want to have honor , love , and respect , - then you 're out of your mind . 
- No . I don 't need any of that crap . 
Will you just let me show you my plan now ? 
No , I don 't care ! 
100 from the Liberals , 30 from the Democrats , and 20 more to win over individually . There 'll be 20 newly-appointed assemblymen in the next election . 
Including you . How many does that make ? A 170 . 
- I said I don 't care . - With 170 assemblymen , we could reform parliament . 
Then regardless of who 's elected , the National Assembly will be under Cheongwoo control . We will appoint a prime minister and that person will be you , son . 
Who the hellâ  ¦ in the Liberal Party would be crazy enough to support me ? 
They wouldn 't support you , they would support Kang Seongmin . 
Kang will push to reform parliament in hopes of being Prime Minister . 
Meanwhile , we 'll make you an assemblyman in three years . And once the reforms have gone through , we 'll make you Prime Minister instead . 
Now , think of what you really want . The Reconstruction Project ? 
Do you want to be an assemblyman or the Prime Minister ? 
Answer the question . 
The Prime Minister . 
Then focus only on what you want from now on ! Focus ! 
I want to revive it ! 
I want the National Reconstruction Project to go forward ! 
I 'll break up with her . 
In lifeâ  ¦ when you gain somethingâ  ¦ you 're bound to lose something else . 
You know that , don 't you ? 
Please stay here . 
Mr. Yoon . 
Wouldn 't we be safer with the rest of the party ? 
Pleaseâ  ¦ please , just wait a minute . 
Let me justâ  ¦ let me go check it out first . 
- Hey , who the hell are you ? 
Goddamn it ! 
I 'm the boss , you idiot ! 
You piece of shit ! What do you think you 're doing ? 
Actually , we don 't answer to you anymore . 
What ? 
If you touch me , I 'll kill you right here . 
What are you going to do , huh ? Hmm ? 
Are you crazy ? 
Go ahead , go ahead and try me . 
- Go ahead . - Yeah ? 
Just go . 
I can do it . 
Hey , hey , hey , hey . 
Who the hell are you ? 
- Get out of my way , you dirtbag ! 
Snap out of it . 
I 'll finish it , get out of here . 
Fuck ! 
Mr. Yoon . 
- Were you hit ? 
- Yeahâ  ¦ 
You 're okay , Haejun . 
Jongchul ! 
Haejun 's just been shot ! 
Jongchul ! 
Haejun , hey , it 's okay . 
We just got to get to the hospital . 
Haejun . 
Hey , Haejun ! 
Goddamn it ! 
Oh , Haejun ! 
Oh , fuck ! 
Please wait outside , ma 'am . 
Oh , minister ! 
Choo Intae , he 's just been attacked . 
What ? 
Who 's just been attacked ? 
He 's in critical condition . 
- Really ? 
- Yeah . 
Critical condition . 
What about Yoon Palbong ? 
He was found dead at the scene , sir . 
Stupid fucking idiots . 
A witness says he saw Cha Taemin A witness says he saw Cha Taemin from the Sineui Alliance . 
Yes . 
Ah , yes , sir . We are currently investigating the matter . 
The deceased was a gangster named Gu Haejun . 
Hey , look at this . 
Hey , hey ! 
The 4th Sail Salt Farm Association Manager Cha Taemin 
Hey , I 'm your hyung . 
I got it done . 
Shit or get off the pot , all right ? 
Hyung , my ass . 
Goodbye , hyung . 
Oh , pardon me , sir . 
Mr. Minchul , the son of Segang Textiles CEO An Yosub , died in an explosion . 
He 'd been gaining notoriety as the potential new leader of the Liberal Party . 
Who do you think is behind it ? 
Who stands to benefit the most from An Minchul 's death ? 
Kang Seongmin ? 
Is this Taemin of the Sineui Alliance ? 
If this gets out , it 's over for Kang Seongmin . 
Questions arise about Sineui Alliance , the anarchist terrorist group Unraveling Sineui Alliance , the force behind Choo Intae 's shooting 
" The Sineui Alliance does not solely target leftist groups in their terror attacks . In fact , 
- there are also certain political - - " 
- They 're implicating me . 
They haven 't named anyone . 
" The power struggle between this generation 's politicians . " 
They 're implying it . 
- They printed this to attack you ? 
- It 's Cha Taemin . He 's the only one who had this photo . 
" The explosion in Busan is also linked to the Sineui Allia - - " 
That 's enough . 
Ministry of Home Affairs 
We will move within each department and region in order to amend the Local Government Act . 
Here 's an outline of the voting process . 
40 percent will vote early . Groups of three , five , and nine - - 
- Take a look at this . 
I 'm sure you all saw the articles . The situation is very serious . 
But is itâ  ¦ even true ? 
You saw the picture . 
Kang Seongmin did it . Can we agree ? 
Yes , it had to be Kang Seongmin . 
Why would we have this meeting if it wasn 't Kang Seongmin ? 
In the event thatâ  ¦ Kang turns out to be a member of the Sineui Alliance , we need a contingency plan . 
We need one now ? 
Mm , why make a big fuss over this ? 
If Kang Seongmin gets wind of it , we 'll find ourselves in an awkward position . 
True or not , we ought to have a plan ready . 
Listen . I think we should look into this matter more thoroughly . 
Wouldn 't it be rather rash for us to suspect another Cheongwoo Federation member without knowing all the details ? 
I will investigate this and do it discreetly . 
Yes , sir . We have just confirmed that it 's a false rumor . 
And the press fabricated the story . 
Yes , Minister . Yes , sir , we 'll be taking the appropriate actions . 
Yes . 
As for the party , sir , they will take action as quickly as possible . 
True or false ? 
Is it true or false ? 
It 's false . 
Somebody 's trying to defame me . - Who ? 
- We 're looking into it . 
Is the Sineui Alliance behind An Minchul 's death ? 
I wouldn 't know . 
That 's what it saidâ  ¦ in the article . 
That 's all just speculation . 
I expect Mr. An Yosub also would make the same speculation . 
What use are you if the Federationâ  ¦ doesn 't support you ? 
That arrogant bastard , I can 't wait to kill him someday . 
Someone will overhear you . 
Call Mr. Pak Jiwook for me . 
Hello , sir . 
Sâ  ¦ Sir . 
Hello , sir . 
What brings you here unannounced ? 
So Cha Taemin , you haven 't found him ? 
Jeon Soyong Director of the National Security Bureau 
He won 't be easy to find . 
What about the other Sineui punks ? 
Those guys have been inactive for over 10 years . 
You still got a list ? Show me then . 
And why does the National Assembly need that ? 
Just show me . 
10 years ago , we established all of their whereabouts . 
- Why ? 
- No idea . 
The director at the time told us to , so that was it . 
Our boys just pretend to look for them . 
They 're hard to catch . And if we do get them , we have to let them go . 
Samsik . 
Yes , sir . 
Wait outside , Professor Hwang . 
Kang Seongmin and the Sineui Alliance , huhâ  ¦ That true ? 
He and Cha Taemin did spend some time together back in Busan . 
Uhâ  ¦ 
Did Cha Taemin kill him or did Kang Seongmin do it ? 
I can 't say I 'm sure about that . 
What are the campaign expenses looking like this month ? 
Two million hwan to the National Security Bureau , three million to the Ministry of Home Affairs , and five million to the Liberal Party . 
Let 's stop all the transfers for now . 
Yes , sir . 
You go find Cha Taeminâ  ¦ and you figure out who killed my son . - All right ? 
- Yes , sir . I 'll look for him right away . 
Mr. Cha Taemin . 
Mr. Cha ? 
Here , I 've brought you some food . 
Here 's some whiskey too . 
Oh , andâ  ¦ this is for you . Uhâ  ¦ it 's a ticket for a cargo ship leaving Busan for Shimonoseki in one week . Make a note of the time . 
Choo Intaeâ  ¦ is he dead ? 
We don 't have any information yet . 
Choo Intaeâ  ¦ I didn 't mean to kill him . 
Don 't worry about it too much , all right ? 
Yoon Palbong is responsible for it . 
Keep yourself hidden . 
Is Samsik coming ? 
Of course . 
What is it ? What did An Yosub say ? 
He was asking about what happened in Busan . 
I 'm getting anxious . 
Yeah , you . 
Where 's Cha Taemin hiding out ? 
Why would you ask me a thing like that ? 
Kang Seongmin asked me to ask you . 
He didn 't turn up at our agreed-upon location . 
And where did you agree to meet him next ? 
And why is a National Assembly member interested in such things ? 
Ah , must be a habit from your days as a Japanese cop , I guess . 
You 're right . 
Back when I was a junsa , I should have just shot you and gotten rid of you . 
Iâ  ¦ uhâ  ¦ sorryâ  ¦ I 'm sorry . 
When is Cha leaving for Osaka ? 
Next week . 
From Busanâ  ¦ on a cargo ship . 
Where 's his ticket ? 
Cha Taemin has it already . 
Has he left for Busan yet ? 
I don 't know . 
Bastard . 
Are you all right ? 
Yeah . 
Yoon Palbongâ  ¦ got himself killed talking back , huh ? 
Take a look at the addresses . 
I want you to tail each of these punks . 
What do we do if we run into Taemin ? 
If there 's a chance he 's a threat , shoot the guy . 
Where do you think Cha Taemin 's most likely to show up ? 
I 'd start off by searching Kang Seongmin 's property . 
Is Taemin reallyâ  ¦ that connected to Mr. Kang Seongmin ? 
Don 't ask questions , kid , just go do it . You know better than to ask about that . 
Did you agree to meet Taemin at the villa ? - Yeah . 
- Change the location . 
Assemblyman , is it true you were an active member of the Sineui Alliance ? 
Can you address the allegations that you 're behind the death of An Minchul ? 
You really think it 's me in that photo ? 
I don 't see the resemblance . 
So , you 're saying the allegations aren 't true ? 
Are you denying involvement with the Sineui Alliance ? 
- Mr . Kang Seongmin ! 
- Didn 't you say you spoke to all the news outlets ? 
I did , but it didn 't seem to do anything . 
When I don 't answer one of their questions , it becomes fact . 
Why haven 't the Cheongwoo Federation campaign funds come through yet ? 
Doesn 't this mean that Mr. An Yosub can 't trust Mr. Kang ? 
You can 't be serious ! 
Then explain why the money they promised hasn 't come through yet . 
This is why Kang Seongmin is untrustworthy . 
There 's no need for the party to be so suspicious of me ! 
Sir , please . 
Why are you all acting like this ? 
Just wait a little bit and you 'll get the money . 
Those lowlifes , right to my face . 
I 'd go see Mr. An Yosub now . We don 't want additional rumors . 
What do I say to him though ? 
Well , at the very least , you need to go and beg him to save you . 
If we don 't get campaign funds from the Cheongwoo Federation , we might not be able to pass the Local Government Act . 
Ilmo Hospital 
Yoon Palbong found dead . 
- Is Chairman Kim San here ? - Yeah . 
San . 
I introduced Yoon Palbong to the Innovation Party . 
How did you two know each other ? 
The army supply business . 
It 's weighing on me a little . 
Yes . - Good job . Here . 
- Yes , sir . 
Looks good to me . 
- Looks good . 
- Okay . 
- Okay , thanks . - All right , it 's nothing . Thank you . 
- Enjoy the food . - See you later . 
Yes , right . Uhâ  ¦ thanks . 
Oh , thank you . 
Well , I didn 't put in any extra for you . 
Wait , but you 're giving me so much here . 
Huh ? Hey , you need this much to raise four kids , man . 
I 'll try to get you more next time . 
Put that away . 
Thank you . 
- Thank you so much . 
Excuse me , where 's Oh Inwoo 's desk ? 
We don 't know who sent it . 
Is there other evidence that he was an active member of the Sineui Alliance ? 
It 's not necessarily proofâ  ¦ Kang Seongmin 's father also died in an explosives accident . 
The Sineui Alliance is known for using explosives . 
And you know what else we found ? 
Why would Cha Taemin want to kill Yoon Palbong ? 
The police report also states that Yoon Palbong was the first one to get shot . 
It seems that Choo Intae wasn 't their initial target . 
So , you 're sayingâ  ¦ Yoon Palbong is connected to Kang Seongmin ? 
I think so . 
- Uncle Samsik . - Oh . 
Phew , you scared me . 
Why are you here ? 
I want to get revenge . 
You know who did it , don 't you ? You know who killed Haejun ? 
Have you heard of the Sineui Alliance ? 
No . 
They 're known for assassinating prominent figures , regardless of their position . 
I don 't care . 
They 're incredibly dangerous . 
It doesn 't matter . 
Oh , yeah ? 
There 's something you need to do first . 
Whatever it is , I 'll do it . 
Ilmo Hospital 
Leave . 
You should go and chase your dreams . 
Sitting next to me is the worst kind of hypocrisy . 
Leave . 
Leave . 
Did you see the news ? 
Yes . Such a tragic turn of events . 
Have you made up your mind yet ? Finally ? 
Yes . 
I don 't need nice guys . 
And we are waging a war here . 
I won 't tolerate any tears . 
I 've already shed all my tears . I 'm done with that . 
Do you think you can beat Kang Seongmin ? 
I know that I have toâ  ¦ in order to live . 
Is the death of the Seodaemun gang thug , Gu Haejun , in any way connected to Samsik ? 
I 'm really not sure . 
What about the death of Dongdaemun gang thug , Yoon Palbong ? 
As far as I know , it was a coincidence . 
So it was a coincidence that a Dongdaemun gang thug joined the Innovation Party ? 
Yoon Palbongâ  ¦ was known to hold Mr. Choo Intae in high regard . 
Samsik had something to do with Choo Intae 's assassination , didn 't he ? 
No . 
It was an accident . 
So , you 're saying that Choo Intae 's death was an accident ? 
Choo Intae , Yoon Palbong , and Pak Jiwook . 
A coincidence you say ? 
I 'm not entirely sure if it was meant to be or a coincidence . 
I guessâ  ¦ these are just the cards we 're dealt . 
If it isn 't the traitor , Jang Doosik . 
Samsik , I 'mâ  ¦ here to bail you out . 
Your death isn 't in the cards yet . 
So how exactly are you going to shuffle my cards ? 
Uncle Samsik doesn 't believe in things like fate and fortune . 
He puts his own plans into action and he 's extremely determined to make the world spin in his favor . 
If those plans are foiled , he makes new ones . 
That is the nature of Uncle Samsik . 
Did I create the world we 're in ? 
Surely , it 's the world that created me .
