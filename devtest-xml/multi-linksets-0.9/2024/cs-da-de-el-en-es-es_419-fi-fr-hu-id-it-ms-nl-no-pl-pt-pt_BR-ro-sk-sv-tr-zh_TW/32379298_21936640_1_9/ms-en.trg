Seongmin , don 't cry . 
It 's the ocean . 
Oh , sweetie . 
- Samsik . 
- Huh ? 
Do you see that ship over there ? 
- Yes , sir . - Do you have any idea how that giant thing moves ? 
It 's oil . 
You must sell oil to become truly rich . 
Uncle Samsik 
Uncle Samsik 
The Deceased March 6 , 1960 Seoul , South Korea Democratic Party 
- They 're here ! They 're here . - Hello . 
They 're outside ! 
Has Mr. Kang Seongmin apologized to you ? 
Will you report Mr. Kang Seongmin to the Ethics Committee ? 
Why are you at the National Assembly - at that hour ? 
Did you already know that they plan to rush the bill ? 
- Okay , let 's go . 
- All right , let 's go . 
We strongly condemnâ  ¦ â  ¦ the rushed passing of the bill . If Kang Seongmin and the Liberal Party do not issue an official apology , the Ethics Committee will then have to hear about it . I apologize . 
Officially . 
Then , the bill should be allowed another vote . 
The Local Government Act has been passed already . 
We can 't accept these illegal actions ! 
It 's fine . 
Then , you 'll issue an apology to our Chairman Kim San . And publish it in the Liberal Party publication - and to the press as well . 
- That 's not necessary . 
Everything you just said , that will suffice . 
What ? 
- You 're gonna let it slide ? 
- Yes , and from time to time , we should . 
That 'll be fine . 
Hey , wait . Why did you do that ? 
It 's all right , sir . 
- I 'll be in touch . - Youâ  ¦ Hey . 
You said you 'd take it easy on him . 
This is different . The man hit someone at the National Assembly . 
How would that make me look ? 
Have you seen thatâ  ¦ list of names I sent ? 
Yes , I did see it . 
I 'd like to discuss , mmâ  ¦ some of the seats like the district committee chairmen and allâ  ¦ the party leaders . 
It 's already been discussed . 
Tell Kang Seongmin I want to meet in private . 
I won 't let it escalate at the Ethics Committee . 
Mm ? Okay . 
Can we talk ? 
Yeojin . 
How 'd you get here ? 
- What ? 
- Why are you a reporter ? 
Is that weird for a Korean Literature grad ? 
Running into each other this wayâ  ¦ it 's awkward for the both of us . 
If you don 't make things awkwardâ  ¦ then they won 't be . 
Ms. Yeojin , come on . 
We need to get going now . 
- He just fell asleep . 
- Oh , don 't wake him . 
He was in critical condition last night . 
I see . He 's gonna pull through . 
Do you think I 'll do well ? 
Eh , what ? 
Ah , of course . 
To be honest , I 'm a little scared . Scared that I 'll ruin everything my father has achieved . 
Well , I 'll assist you where I can . 
His influence over the Federation has been too great . 
Once we reform the system , that 'll be over . 
Is parliamentary reform possible ? 
Yes . 
I 've agreed to meet Mr. Sun Wooseok later . 
I thought we were done talking . 
You 've already agreed to combining the parties . 
I 'd like to discuss things further . 
It can 't be that you 've had a change of heart , can it ? 
Huh ? No , that 's not it . 
List of the cabinet members Distribution of constituencies 
This won 't do . 
Everyone 's been elected three times over on our side . 
What 's that have to do with the matter ? 
You want to cherry-pick from us , while the others just sit out ? 
Well , our side has over 100 people . 
State Council splits in half . And three seats for the economic sector . Three . 
You have to consider the number of seats , Mr. Sun . 
Can you really bring over 100 seats ? 
I can guarantee 30 more seats from the Democratic Party . 
I 'll have to pass . 
To be quite frank with you , there are some who are suspicious of your integrity . 
Why ? 
You know , that rumor , the Sineui Alliance . 
Who believes in such a ridiculous rumor ? 
I don 't believe it . 
Who is it then ? 
Give me their names . Who is it ? 
If An Yosub becomes suspicious , the Cheongwoo Federation could abandon Kang Seongmin . 
Sir , An Yosub is not long for this world . 
I just visited him at the hospital . 
Huh . The man will be dead soon . And what can that kid , An Kichul , do about it ? 
The Cheongwoo Federation 's in the palm of our hand , huh ? 
What game are you playing ? Huh ? 
Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? 
Is this you calling it quits ? Are you done ? 
Come again ? 
What 's going on ? 
Where 's all this coming from ? 
You think merging these parties is easy ? Huh ? 
You haven 't changed your mind , have you ? 
Let 's negotiate further , huh ? 
They 're three-time officeholders ! 
They 're hard to convince ! 
Fine . I 'll leave it to you . 
Don 't worry too much about it . 
Sun Wooseok is just trying to act tough with you , nothing more . 
He looks down on me . He thinks the Democratic Party is going to win . 
The Liberal Party and Cheongwoo Federation have abandoned me . 
He 's just changing his stance because those idiots see me as some kind of joke . 
President Rhee is going to win regardless . 
You know what kind of man Choi Minkyu is . 
The type to pull out all the stops . 
Sun Wooseok will have his tail between his legs after the election . 
It doesn 't seem like we 'll win right now . 
Assemblyman , there 's a sure way to win . 
What is it ? 
The late Choo Intae . 
How do I use a dead person ? 
You can use him because he 's dead . 
Democratic Party 
Hi , come in . 
- Did you call on me ? - Yes . 
Well , I 've reviewed the entire draft of your pledges . The old faction has also agreed to it . 
I may be getting ahead of myself , but the old and new factions are reviewing the next parliament . Assemblyman Sun Wooseok has suggested creating a National Reconstruction Bureau . 
What do you think ? 
So not part of the Ministry of Home Affairsâ  ¦ 
Why don 't you prepare a proposal for the National Reconstruction Bureau ahead of time ? 
I could not have recommended you more highly . 
Quick , come in . 
The Reconstruction Project . Isn 't that exactly what you wanted ? 
- Thank you for your trouble , sir . 
- Of course . 
If the Reconstruction Bureau gets established , who knows , you might become its minister . 
I 'm not pining for it , butâ  ¦ 
Will the new system work ? 
I 'll ask Uncle Samsik . 
No . Why would you discuss it with that guy , huh ? 
Don 't trust Samsik too much , okay ? 
He 's well known for enticing people with his words , got it ? 
Keep this to yourself . 
Assemblyman Sun Wooseok appeared to be giving up on the parliamentary system . And for good reason . 
The Democratic Party 's approvals were through the roof . 
So , did you keep it a secret from Samsik ? 
No . 
Why not ? 
- Hey , bring us some whiskey . 
- Welcome in . 
Sure . 
Should I bring out your opened bottle ? 
- Oh , sure , sure . Just bring us whatever ! - Sounds great . 
All right . 
Mr. Sun , you were quite popular at the rally . 
Nah . 
It doesn 't matter who appears at campaign rallies from now on . 
Yeah , still , you should arrange more campaign appearances . 
You 'll need to exercise if you 're going to manage a busy schedule . 
You 're right . The only exercise I get is from sex . 
You can 't call it exercise if you only do two minutes a month . 
- Oh , you 're here . 
- Or was it just one ? 
Hey , you do get exercise . 
You need to be fit to cozy up to both sides , after all . 
What are you doing ? 
Out here . Go . 
What 's wrong ? 
Kang Seongmin said something ? 
- What exactly did you say to Kim San ? 
- What ? 
Did you mention the Reconstruction Bureau ? Did you tempt him with the position of minister ? 
Jeez . What 'd he do ? Did he rat me out ? 
He came to try to convince me . He wasn 't ratting you out . 
That innocent Kim San . He said he didn 't care about status . 
He wanted to know why he should plot with Kang Seongmin . 
That 's how innocent he is . And you tried to tempt such an honest child . 
God , you old man ! 
You 're so superficial . That 's why you 'll always be third-rate . 
It 's not like that . I wasn 't really trying to call it quits . 
Should I go and tell all those people in there that you 're working with Kang Seongmin ? 
I 'm sorry . 
Try and sway Kim San one more time , and I won 't just sit back and watch . 
Okay then . I 'll be more careful . 
The merger will happen as discussed . 
Okay , fine . 
Got it ! 
Samsik would 've been against establishing a National Reconstruction Bureau . 
Why did you tell him ? 
Because you don 't keep secrets from each other ? 
Why did you always tell him everything ? 
- Great work today . - Thank you . 
What 's the occasion ? 
Hey , do you have a second ? 
Can we talk ? 
I never should 've gotten involved with Palbong and the Innovation Party . 
San . I like being a part of the Federation . But getting involved in things like this really scares me . 
Do you think you could help me out ? 
Can you talk to Uncle Samsik ? I can 't take any more of this . 
Don 't worry about it , all right ? I 'll talk to Samsik . 
I 'm sure it 'll all be fine , hmm ? 
Oh , where have you been ? 
I had dinner plans earlier . 
- Yeah , you can go now . 
- Thank you . 
You 've made a lot of headway with this lye factory . 
Yes , sir . 
Are you going to let all your work just go to waste ? 
No , sir . 
We should try toâ  ¦ make a prime minister out of our Kim San . 
Yes , sir . 
Anyone who quits halfway through is the worst kind of person . 
- That 's not what I was - - 
- You say you 're his friend , - yet you hold him back . 
- I 'm just so afraid right now . 
Focus . Stay focused . 
Do you really want to get in our Minister 's way ? That 's what you want ? 
If an honorable life is what you want , let go of your greed . The lye factory , the Cheongwoo Federation , you want it all , don 't you ? You want it all ? 
People only get to fulfill 25 percent of their desires . 
It 's impossible to fulfill 80 or 90 percent . 
Everyone gets the same 25 . 
So how do you change that ? 
You need to increase your desires by 30 , 40 , 50 . 
Do you have zero ambition ? 
You were planning a coup from the beginning , weren 't you ? 
That 's why you told Samsik . 
No . 
I amâ  ¦ planning to stage a coup d 'Ã © tat . 
Capital Defense , the 3rd Marines , the 55th Howitzers , and a squad of 30 from Army Headquarters . 
After the presidential election , the president will head straight to his villa in Jinhae . 
When he does , we 'll take him hostage and declare martial law . If we block all the main roads leading to the capital , we 'll have a good chance of success . 
There 's nothing I detest more than idiots in power . 
I never intended to stage a coup , that wasn 't my plan . 
And yet you did . 
If you never trusted me to begin with , why did you come meet me at the Banya Hotel ? 
Why did you call me there that night ? 
Don 't you think we 're cut from the same cloth ? 
Sir , good evening . 
Hello , thank you for meeting us . 
I 'm Rachael Jeong of the Albright Foundation . Oh , nice to meet you . 
- Is General Choi here ? 
- Yes , he 's waiting for you upstairs . 
Shall we ? 
We both had our suspicionsâ  ¦ and then questioned each other , isn 't that right ? 
Yes . 
The plan felt quite feasible to us . 
Take a drink . 
Security at Jinhae villa is generally around 20 people . The 122nd Battalion is nearby and can infiltrate within an hour . 
- We have to block reinforcements . - Yes , sir . 
We need the support of Logistics Command to move out all troops and equipment . We need this done as soon as possible . 
As soon as a date is set , I 'll prepare everything . 
The plans were perfect , it was completely justified . 
Then why didn 't you stage the coup d 'Ã © tat then and there ? 
It was imminent . 
If you were in my placeâ  ¦ what do you think you would have done exactly ? 
Soldiersâ  ¦ only strategize with power they have at hand . 
If they win the election that 's coming . If the parliamentary reform happens . We do not strategize with such assumptions . 
Not soldiers . 
Weren 't you a soldier yourself ? 
Do you remember that day ? 
Very vividly . 
It was such a crazy day . 
I was the one who suggested creating the Albright Foundation . 
Really ? 
Dad wanted me to do something in Korea . 
It was difficult initially . But it 's fun now . 
That 's amazing . 
This is my uncle . 
He 's a senator . Senator Jeremy Albright . 
Actually , he 's the Foreign Minister now . 
My uncle helped me a great deal . 
I 've met him , just one time . 
Uncle Jeremy spoke very highly of you . 
He did ? 
Excuse me . 
Minister Jeremy has left . 
Thank you . 
Well , seems like they all just left . 
Great work . 
It 's a relief . 
Do you have a cigarette ? 
Did you say that your uncle complimented me ? 
He said you were the best graduate of all time . 
They all said that . 
When I was studying in the States , I did everything in my power to beat those smart and privileged kids . 
They all said the same thing . " Kim San , you have the potential to actually change Korea . People like you need to go to Korea to change it . " 
I guessâ  ¦ I didn 't know it would take so much time . 
So that 's why you 're so worried . 
I think that you can do it . 
' Cause your ideas , and your views , and your vision of a new Koreaâ  ¦ have opened my mind . 
I really think youâ  ¦ can change everything . 
I 'll be honest . 
I have a confession . 
What is it ? 
I want to hear it . 
General Choi Hanrim was my idea . 
What ? 
I 'm the one that chose you too . 
I think South Korea lacks the capacity to become a democracy right now . 
That 's why we need an incredible leader . 
That 's the dream I 've had since I came to Korea . 
To make a great leader for us . 
A great leader . 
You 're lucky , Rachael . 
I have nothing to choose . 
You do have something to choose . 
You can choose me , and the Albright Foundation is yours . 
Thank you . 
Samsik can 't know about youâ  ¦ about you meeting General Doosik today . 
Let me deal with that . 
So did it seem like Choi Hanrim was suspicious of anything ? 
No . 
Would you like some bread ? 
I 'll take some water . 
Sure . 
I just met with Mr. Sun Wooseok . 
Is that all right with you ? It doesn 't matter . 
Don 't forget , there is no reason to be shaken by the things Wooseok says . 
He 's known for running his mouth close to an election . 
He promises you the moon and says he can guarantee certain positions for you . 
I don 't believe him . You can rest easy . 
Did something good happen today ? 
No . Why ? 
Well , you just seem to be in , uhâ  ¦ an especially good mood . 
I had a few drinks , that 's why . 
Oh , who with ? 
With Rachael . 
Did Rachael suggest having drinks with you ? 
We got bored waiting around , so we had a drink , that 's all . 
She must 've really enjoyed your company . 
You should try your luck with Rachael . 
You 'll gain a great support system if you become a son-in-law - to the Albright family . 
- Let 's just discuss work . 
Pak Jiwook is going to be charged tomorrow . 
I see . 
That 's everything , right ? 
Minister . 
It 's really good to see you in such a good mood now . 
Then buy me a drink sometime , all right ? 
Sure , will do . 
You 'll hear from me . 
March 15th . The fourth presidential election is currently looming . 
Candidates from each party have been campaigning daily to appeal for citizens ' support . 
The Democratic Party candidates are gaining great traction and they have put forth a new economic policy in an effort to emphasize how they are different from the current administration . 
Citizens gathered at Jangchungdan showing support for the Democratic Party 's policies . 
Many political commentators have remarked on the Liberal Party 's need to increase votes in regional areas for President Rhee 's re-election . 
Vote for Number 1 
Rhee Seungmin for president Rhee Kihak for vice president 
No matter what ! 
Number one ! No matter what ! 
With the amendment of the Local Government Act , government workers will be assigned to each district . We will obtain ballots of the elderly and those who have moved elsewhere . We 'll secure 40 percent of supporting votes prior to the election . 
Now , make sure you all remember your groups , and do it , just as you rehearsed . 
Wait , your group wasâ  ¦ 
Isn 't he in our group ? 
Hey , you ! 
Stay in your group of three . Three in a group ! That 's all ! 
You think voting is a joke ? 
Come here . 
The group leader gets the paper ballot first . 
The rest follow suit and vote the same way . Then you go and show the observer right over there . 
Come on , is that so hard ? 
- Right . Okay . - Yes , sir . Have you looked into how regional government employees have been mobilized ? 
Yes , although it 's worse than that . 
We 've received intel they 've even had voting rehearsals with many residents . 
- Rehearsals ? - Yes . 
They rehearsed voting for President Rhee in small groups . 
- Do you know where that is ? 
- Yes , should I go there right now ? 
Go . Cover that story , then call me . 
Yes , sir . 
What 's next ? 
Here 's a follow-up article about Kang Seongmin 's potential link to the Sineui Alliance . 
Links between anarchist group Sineui Alliance and Kang Seongmin 
Drop this one . 
- We don 't have any solid answers yet . 
- No Sineui Alliance stories . 
What 's next ? What 'd you find ? Let 's hear it . 
Right . 
What is it ? 
Reporters who covered the Sineui Alliance in the past were threatened . 
Mr. Lee 's justâ  ¦ He 's worried about you . 
The police report stated that Yoon Palbong was shot first that day . 
The following shot that was fired was aimed at him as well . 
What do you think that means ? 
I don 't know . 
The whole thing feels off . And no one 's covering it . 
I know a detective who investigated the Sineui Alliance . I 'll see what he knows . 
Capital Defense Command 
This way . 
What 's all this ? 
Some care packages just came in . 
Where 'd they all come from ? 
There 's an importer that supplies goods to Logistics Command , I ordered extras because I wanted to bring them here . 
So let me guess , you still haven 't found those Sineui bastards ? 
Hey , what 's with the silence , you punks ? 
Police chiefs who have gathered from all over the country , the fate of the country rests on this election . 
We must unite and protect South Korea . 
Let us protect our country ! 
To victory ! 
- To victory ! To victory ! - To victory ! To victory ! - To victory ! To victory ! - To victory ! To victory ! - To victory ! To victory ! - To victory ! To victory ! 
Army Counter Intelligence Corps 
Well , you 're a commie if Hong Youngki says you 're a commie . 
How 's that ? On what grounds ? 
He goes and cooks up some evidence , and you 're behind bars . 
- Get Captain Kim first ! 
- Grab him ! 
He got a third of all our generals stripped of their badges . 
- Let him go ! - Waitâ  ¦ 
If he were to get a hold of you , it doesn 't matter what rank you are . 
- Get him ! 
- Drag him out , right now ! 
- Everyone go inside ! 
- Please , let him go ! 
- Keep it moving ! 
- Wâ  ¦ What are you doing ? Hey ! 
Why are you doing this ? 
Go , right now ! 
- Pak Wonil . 
- Yes , sir . 
You know Labor Party Directive 29 , right ? 
I 'm not sure , sir . 
Labor Party Directive 29 . " Infiltrating the military - to win over diplomats . " 
I 'm not familiar with that , sir . 
Have a smoke . 
It 'll help you think . 
Yeah , yeah , see you . 
What ? 
Why are you blocking my way ? 
We 're here from the Prosecutor 's Office , sir . 
Prosecutor ? 
How dare a lowlife prosecutor block the path of an assemblyman ? 
Get him . Heyâ  ¦ 
- Get him . - Let go , assholes ! 
I plan to go after Pak Jiwook and use Han Soo as bait . 
Then what ? 
Then Pak Jiwook could be the bait to get Choi Hanrim , that 's what . 
Hong Youngki has made his moves . 
Major General Min Soochul of the Capital Defense Unit will be arrested for espionage . 
This was in one of the vases . What is this ? 
I happen to have made alliances within Capital Defense . 
- Jang Doosikâ  ¦ - Sir . â  ¦ the new commander of Capital Defense will appoint Jeong Hanmin as his deputy . 
Lieutenant Colonel Jeong Hanmin , Capital Defense Unit . 
That way , Doosik and Hanmin will have Choi Hanrim on a tight leash . 
Commander , thank you . 
Hmm . 
Here . 
The addresses are five years old . It 's hard to say if they 'd still be there , but that 's what we 've got . 
I appreciate it . 
Why are you looking into it ? 
Cha Taemin hasn 't been caught yet . 
They 're not even looking for him . 
Kang Seongmin 's really not part of the Alliance ? 
A little while ago , Mr. Pak Jiwook took these addresses too . 
He called his subordinates , the ones from his old cop days . 
Pak Jiwook , huh ? 
I 'm done doing favors for you , all right ? 
The police are also getting involved in the election , so things are crazy . 
They 're involving the entire police force ? 
I mean , can you prove that ? 
Stop asking questions , goddamn it . 
You 're unbelievable . 
List of Sineui Alliance members 
Assemblyman Pak Jiwook sent his former cop buddies after the Sineui Alliance . 
If they find those men , they 'll probably also find Cha Taemin . 
Why would he get involved ? 
Kang Seongmin must be tied to it somehow . 
Elections abusing power . Elections based on bribery . Illegal elections . 
All of these things are happening in this corrupt democracy . 
Democracy 
Collusion , conspiracy , and hypocrisy are rampant . 
Here you are . 
The election is falling into an endless confusion . 
Regardless of which side wins , we won 't escape that confusion . 
Will political chaos end up being South Korea 's growing pains , or its death sentence ? We must wait and see . 
Yes , thank you . - Right . 
It is because politicians are solely immersed in the fight for their careers . 
From this moment on , the Sineui Alliance is reinstated . 
We will fight back against authorities , powers , and injustices . 
Intellectuals have sold their souls , politicians have sold their ideologies , and citizens have sold their hope . 
The politically aware citizens must rise up . 
What has once been lostâ  ¦ is difficult to recover . 
And no one is able to fight on our behalf . 
In a democracy , all sovereignty belongs to the people . 
If the owner does not raise their voice and state their claimâ  ¦ who will defend them ? 
Sineui Alliance is an armed group that fights against injustice . 
Sineui Alliance opposes the authorities and powers that oppress our people and our nation . 
We strictly condemn philosophies , people , and groups who monopolize their control and power . We will prepare the weapons and violence to enact this . 
Anyone encouraging persecution will be dealt with by the Sineui Alliance . 
All right . Okay . 
Uncle . 
It 's all right , it 's all right . 
It won 't last long . Can you let those students go ? 
Of course . 
What will become of Pak Wonil and Kim Inho ? 
They 've been captured . 
They will both confess within the evening . 
I have a confession too . 
What is it ? 
Rachael and I slept together . 
Is that why you were in such a good mood before ? 
I can stop right now if you want me to . 
Rachael is likeâ  ¦ pufferfish at a restaurant . 
If you extract its poison correctly , it becomes a delicacy , but if you don 't extract it rightâ  ¦ you could die . 
Rachael was the one who planned the coup d 'Ã © tat . 
Yes , I 'm aware . 
Are you sure we should still go through with this ? 
Yes . All we have to do is stick to the plan . 
But what if something goes wrong ? 
Life itself doesn 't always go according to plan , and yet that fact is just a part of life . 
And whose fault is that ? 
It 's just how things go .
