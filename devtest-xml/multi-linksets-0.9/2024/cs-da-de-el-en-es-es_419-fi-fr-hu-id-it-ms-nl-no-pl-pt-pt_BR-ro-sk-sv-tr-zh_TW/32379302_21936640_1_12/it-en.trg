Huh ? Get up , you little brat .

Hey . 
I told you . Stay out of it . 
What ? 
Get back to work , asshole . 
You little shit . Cut it out . Get outta my face ! 
Piece of shit . 
Go ! 
A few of them ran away toward the ocean . This one died while running . 
- Get rid of him . - Yes , sir . 
Hey , Cha Taemin . 
Cha Taemin ! 
Throw him out . 
Hurry up , just do it .

Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? - Hey , you need to settle down . 
- Wait , what are you doing ? - Get outta here . 
- What 's going on ? - You need to get out of here ! 
- Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? 
- Hey , you can 't be taking pictures . No photographs ! 
Look at these ! These all have been pre-filled out , haven 't they ? 
Huh ? 
- Hey , you can 't be doing that ! Let go ! This is a fraudulent election ! 
These ballots are already filled out ! 
- Stop , you assholes ! 
Stop right there ! 
Hello , sir . 
Yes , the protests ... the protests are getting more and more violent . 
People who haven 't received their ballots are out fighting and going crazy . 
And the Democratic Party Masan branch declared the election results invalid . 
Hey , hey , hey , Woojin . 
Get yourself back here if it 's dangerous out there . 
I don 't want you to stay there , okay ? 
Yes , sir , I 'll head back soon . 
Yes , sir .

Let 's vote , all right ?

The series of public disturbances in Masan , Daegu , and Yeosu , were the actions of rebellious forces following orders from the North , in an attempt to invalidate the presidential election . 
The press must refrain from publishing any unconfirmed details before the facts of the matter have been verified , for the sake of the nation . 
That 's all . 
I 'm not taking any more questions . 
SOMEWHERE NEAR SEOUL 
UNDER MAINTENANCE 
Come on . 
I said I 'm not taking questions . 
Those cops that Pak Jiwook called upon . You know where they are , don 't you ? 
I just need an address . 
An address ? 
Thank you , sir . 
Move outta the way ! 
Get out . 
- What the hell ? - Get out . 
Hurry up ! Get out , asshole ! 
- Leave the ballots and go . 
I 'll let you walk away . 
You fucking asshole ! 
Hey . 
You fucking asshole ! 
You fucking asshole ! 
Why did you kill Haejun ? 
You fucking asshole ! 
What the fuck ? I 'm sorry . 
I sincerely apologize . 
I never intended to kill him . 
I 'm very sorry . 
I 'm so sorry . 
Stop taking orders from Uncle Samsik . 
We 're taking the ballot boxes . 
Come here . 
Come here ! 
What the fuck ? 
Fucking asshole ! 
They 're sure it was Cha Taemin ? 
Why did he ... How did he do it ? 
Call the National Security Bureau ... 
No , wait . Wait , wait . 
I 'll put Pak Jiwook 's lackeys on it instead . 
No one can know anything about this . Huh ? 
- Where 're you going ? 
- Oh , just ... Something urgent has come up . 
What is it ? 
Cha Taemin has stolen the ballot boxes ... 
- Are you serious ? 
- Yeah . 
Why didn 't you notify the Democratic Party ? 
You just watched them steal the ballot boxes ? 
Samsik had already done what he wanted . 
I didn 't think stealing the ballot boxes would ... would really affect the outcome of the election . 
Why would he do that ? 
I bet ... I bet he 'll give the story to the press . 
If the press gets wind of this , it 'll cause a riot . 
Hanmin has ... he 's repositioned troops on behalf of General Choi Hanrim . 
Hanmin did that on his own ? 
Yes . He 's gonna make a move . I have a feeling . 
He 's meeting with General Jang later . What do I do ? 
That 's not true . It 's completely absurd . 
It was Kim San 's idea to meet with Jang Doosik . 
He was the one suggesting we stage a coup if the ... if the Democratic Party ever lost the election . 
Field grade officers are incredibly dissatisfied . 
This is not something anyone can shut down . 
Doesn 't matter if it 's politics or the military , all the people in power are idiots . 
And General Jang ? 
Jang Doosik 's an opportunist . 
He 'll be fine on his own . 
All we 're doing is using him . 
San . I intend to make a new world for you . 
Just convince General Choi and the Albright Foundation for me . Yeah ? 
Okay ? 
The commanders who are already committed are not gonna back down easily . 
What about General Choi ? 
General Choi has not completely lost interest in this , but he ... he 's concerned that if the Democrats win the election then it won 't be justified . 
That 's what I 'm saying . 
Justification 's crucial with these things . 
Yes , but sir , we make the justification . 
General . 
Are you satisfied commanding the Capital Defense Unit ? 
General Choi possesses none of the , uh ... the courage to do great things . 
General , you just say the word . We 're determined ... to make you the country 's next president . 
Got a cigarette ? 
You think I believed those guys ? 
I know exactly what those brats think of me . 
I didn 't know Hanmin would say such things . 
That 's a load of shit . 
All I did was do what Kim San told me to . 
He said we gotta convince Jang , because he needed Capital Defense on our side . 
We need General Choi Hanrim right now . 
Right , sir , we do . 
Get him to the bunker , all right ? 
Let 's try to convince him . We mobilize the troops if it doesn 't work . 
Yes . 
I 'll make sure to have him standing by . 
Can you really just overlook the death of a colleague ? 
We were all compensated . 
You asshole . 
Well , then how do you propose we catch Taemin ? 
Uncle Samsik ... 
Find Cha Taemin . 
Hey , Oh Inwoo is in here . 
Is he having a drink to clear his head ? 
Cha Taemin will turn up somewhere in the vicinity of the press tonight . 
Contact me if he shows . 
Kill him if we can ? 
You just call me first . 
What if we die trying to take him alive ? 
Just spread out and call me if you see him ! 
Aemin Daily , Politics Department . 
Yeojin . 
Choo Yeojin speaking . 
I killed Choo Intae . 
- Are you listening ? 
- Is this Cha Taemin ? 
Tell me where you are . 
I wanna meet right now . 
HYUBRYEOK DAILY 
AEMIN DAILY 
The 55th Howitzers , the 3rd Marines , and 12th Airborne Brigade will move into the capital region . Capital Defense can block roads around the Han River . If they do , our mission will be a success . 
How 's the opposition ? 
The only unit that can mobilize within half a day is the 15th Division . 
In 12 hours , it 'll be done . 
By which point , our troops will have already been deployed . 
They should ... stand by for now . 
General Choi , doing that could compromise our plans . 
Let 's wait to see the election results . 
You 've made up your mind , right ? 
There 's no turning back now . 
I 'll never turn back . 
So you 've convinced General Choi Hanrim ? 
Yes , that 's correct . 
What made him change his mind ? 
His mind didn 't actually change . It was my mind that changed . 
I don 't think he 's coming . 
Let 's go back . 
Give it a minute . 
Some people have been tailing us for a while now . 
- Who ? 
- I don 't know . 
I 'll lead them away from here . Let 's meet back at the office . 
Okay . 
We 'll mobilize the troops even if we don 't have General Choi 's permission . 
The Reconstruction Bureau . 
Have you given up on it ? 
No , we 'll establish it . If you 're able to help us . You see ... I never trusted those politicians anyway . 
Don 't you see what happened ? 
Kim San set everything up from the very beginning . 
Who would think to exploit General Choi like that ? He 's the only one . 
So what does the Albright Foundation actually do ? 
South Korean politics , society , culture , economics , etcetera , etcetera . 
Everything you can think of . 
Didn 't you write a piece about South Korean politics ? 
I wrote about South Korea 's inability to be a democracy . 
That 's no fun . 
I 've also drafted a Korea-US Economic Agreement . The Korean government didn 't like it . 
Well , it 's Korea 's loss . 
You can 't have dessert without eating your vegetables . How else will they ever grow strong ? 
South Korea ... isn 't capable of becoming a democracy . 
You know that . 
Let 's follow General Choi 's lead ... and do our best to save this nation . 
I 'll do what it takes . 
We 're out of time at this point . 
Petron Harvest has sent a secondary team to investigate the Philippines . 
There 's a chance that everything we put our effort into will disappear . 
How much longer will Korea be held back by political problems ? 
Neither the Liberals nor the Democrats have any sort of future . 
Would it , uh , would it be all right if I if I told Uncle Samsik about our meeting ? 
Sure , go ahead . 
I appreciate that . 
What ? 
Why are you chasing me right now ? 
Where 's Cha Taemin ? 
- You 're meeting him , aren 't you ? 
- Cha Taemin ? 
Ah ... Yeah , we had a drink earlier . I guess you guys must 've missed that . 
You should be more observant . 
Choo Yeojin . 
Have you seen Choo Yeojin ? 
Head over to Aemin Daily . 
I 'll give Uncle Samsik a call . 
Okay . 
Uncle Samsik wants to make Kang Seongmin the Prime Minister . 
Is there even a chance for reform ? 
I 'm not sure to be honest . 
Parliamentary reform is unfeasible . 
I 've told my father as much too . 
Everyone dreams of having absolute power . 
But ... if you had the power to be Prime Minster after reform , wouldn 't you rather become president ? 
Is that what you want ? 
It 's what my father wanted . I didn 't want it . 
So why did you wanna meet me today ? 
Well , I was curious about Kim San . 
Could you be more useful to me than Kang Seongmin ? 
It would take forever to become an assemblyman , then a minister , and do everything you want . 
If Choi Hanrim becomes our next president , you can do all of it as soon as next week . 
That 's what you want , isn 't it ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
You are far better than Kang Seongmin is . 
I appreciate that . 
May I smoke ? 
You knew about Kang killing my brother , didn 't you ? 
An Kichul . He already knew everything that Kang Seongmin and Uncle Samsik had done . 
What the hell is this ? 
The whole thing was Kim San 's idea . 
Rachael Jeong was used by Kim San ! It was all him ! 
That day , after meeting An Kichul , he came to me , he was terrified . 
Kim San did ? 
Kim San came to you terrified ? 
He was trembling all over . 
It wasn 't because I was afraid of An Kichul . 
I felt that the world was changing . 
I could sense the oncoming crash of massive waves that couldn 't be stopped by anyone . 
Every time I felt like that , I wanted to see Uncle Samsik . 
You see , he 's a person ... that 's decisive and full of confidence . He 's unshakable . 
Every time I felt uneasy ... I would go find Uncle Samsik . 
Uncle Samsik . 
Uncle Samsik . 
An Kichul knows everything . 
What ? 
That you killed An Minchul . 
How ? He knows about that ? 
Yes , he knows about everything . 
He 's gonna stage a coup soon , no matter what . 
He wants me to convince General Choi . 
He 'll probably eliminate everyone after that . Kang Seongmin , and me , and you . 
And even General Choi . 
My father told me to leave Kang Seongmin alone ... at least until the reform was finished . But there 's no need to wait any longer . 
Kang Seongmin ... what will you do with him ? 
Kill him , of course . 
In a legal manner . 
Have you heard anything from Uncle Samsik ? 
I 'm sure he has his ways . 
That I don 't know . 
He 's got the Sineui Code of Conduct with Kang Seongmin 's signature . 
He came to Sail Bakery , trembling with fear 
Kim San ... What ? He really said he was trembling ? 
San doesn 't ... tremble , he 's not the type to do that . 
It seemed like he knew every detail . 
You told him about the Sineui Alliance Code ? 
Uncle Samsik , you should meet with An Kichul . 
Excuse me . 
My name 's Cha Taemin . 
Ballot boxes were stolen from opposition-led areas . We were able to recover them all . 
I wanted to meet in person and apologize about Mister Choo Intae . 
You should go . 
- Cha Taemin . 
- Cha Taemin ? 
- Go after him ! 
What if he 's got a gun ? - It 's Taemin ! 
Where 'd that come from ? 
That was Uncle Samsik , wasn 't it ? 
Did you steal the ballot boxes ? 
Taemin . 
Enough ! 
Stop !

Thank you . 
Please go ahead . 
JINJU 
CANDIDATES : RHEE SEUNGMIN , YOON BOHYUN SEOUL , GYEONGGI , GANGWON 
RHEE SEUNGMIN , YOON BOHYUN We won ! 
Yeah ! 
Yes ! 
Ah ! Great work . 
Very well done . 
The count has been finalized , and as a result , it is President Rhee who wins the election . He has been reelected with 9,633,376 votes , 86 % of the total electorate . 
Rhee Seungmin ! 
On March 18th , during the first plenary session of the 35th extraordinary session of the National Assembly House of Representatives , the fourth president , who was elected on March 15th , was officially sworn-in according to Article 53 of the Constitution . 
" The March 15th presidential election was fraudulent . Riddled with collusion and manipulation , it proved to be the worst election in history . An infringement upon democracy . 
We reject these fraudulent election results . We demand a new election be carried out as soon as possible . 
As students , we must continue to fight to defend democracy . We must condemn this blatant act of corruption until justice is finally served . " 
The president had a landslide victory in the election . Protests broke out all over the place over the election fraud . 
General Choi was forced to examine it closely . 
I see . 
People are protesting the election . This is happening everywhere in the country . 
Let 's give it more time . 
General Choi , the protests are not a problem for us . 
These protests justify our delay . 
Go to your unit . 
General , but ... 
There was intense backlash from the fraudulent election . And it just provided more justification for staging a coup . 
Jeong Hanmin threw an incredible fit . Said he 'd prepared all of this , just to have General Choi ruin it . 
He was on the second floor of Taepyeongga screaming his head off at the top of his lungs . 
Everyone there , everyone downstairs could hear it . 
General , please ... 
Please take the lead , General ! 
Lower your voice . 
The Capital Defense Unit is more than sufficient . 
General Choi Hanrim , he won 't be able to pull this off . 
No ! The guy just doesn 't have a plan . 
- Jeong Hanmin . 
- General Jang ! 
I told you , that 's enough . 
Sir , listen to me , you 've gotta make up your mind . 
It 's a mess ' cause of the election . 
Don 't go doing something rash . 
General Jang . 
Sir , you 've gotta make a decision now ! Sir , listen to me ! 
So many leftovers for someone who loves Chinese food . 
Uncle Samsik . 
Why are you in such an incredible rage right now ? 
Pathetic fucking generals ... We should kill them all . 
Our Lieutenant Colonel Jeong Hanmin . He has a burning fire in his soul . 
Yeah . 
I wanna set everything I see on fire . 
Be careful . It could be you who burns to death in that fire of yours . 
We 'll stage the coup by ourselves . 
We don 't need Jang Doosik , that sad excuse for a general ! 
We could use the field grade officers , wipe out all these incompetent generals with our own coup ! 
Yes , go ahead . 
Captain . 
This is Captain Lee . 
Understood , sir . 
What is it ? 
What ? 
Do ... do ... do they want me dead ? 
They don 't , right ? 
- Just call ... call Samsik , okay ? 
- Arms up . 
Ask Samsik about this . 
The Punishment of Corruption Act . The coup d 'état ! 
They 're the ones who planned it all ! 
Why should I die ? 
- Sit still ! 
- Ask Samsik about it . 
Get Samsik in here ! Call Samsik , please ! 
Get Samsik ! 
Samsik ! Get Samsik ! 
It wasn 't me ! 
The Punishment of Corruption Act . The coup d 'état ! They 're the ones who were doing it all ! 
Why should I die ? 
Ask Samsik about it ! Samsik will explain things ! 
Get Samsik in here ! 
Get San ! 
Get San ! Get San ! 
Wait . 
San ! 
Where 's Samsik ? 
Ask Samsik about it . Jang Doosik ! 
General Jang ! 
Please ... please don 't kill me ! General Jang , please help me ! 
I give you my complete loyalty ! Sir , please save me ! Please , help me , General Jang ! 
Ask Samsik ! 
Sam ... Samsik ! Get Samsik ! 
Hanmin . 
S ... San . 
You were here . 
San , something is ... something 's wrong . 
Something has gone wrong , San . 
I tried to explain , but nobody 's listening . 
San , can you tell them ? Huh ? 
There 's been a huge mistake . 
San ! 
You gotta tell ' em , San ! 
San , you have to ! Take him away . 
San ! 
You gotta tell ' em , San ! San ! 
Something has gone wrong here ! 
San ! 
San , you need to tell them ! 
San ! 
San ! San ! 
San ! 
General Jang ! 
Sir ! 
Sir ! 
Captain , this is wrong ! 
Almost there . 
San ! San ! 
- San ! 
- We 're here now . We 're here . 
- San ... - Get him down . 
Save me . 
This is wrong , Captain Lee . 
Just wait . Just wait ! 
He had a burning fire growing in his soul . 
But I guess it has finally gone out now .
