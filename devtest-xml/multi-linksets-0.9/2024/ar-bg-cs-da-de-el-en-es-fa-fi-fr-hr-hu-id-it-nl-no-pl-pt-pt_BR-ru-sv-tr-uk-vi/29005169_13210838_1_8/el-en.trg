I am a great believer in the importance of sartorial expression . 
There 's nothing wrong with conformity , as long as you know you 're conforming . 
Whilst I might dress like a sheep , there are various tell-tale signs that betray to the esoteric eye that I am , in fact , a wolf ... in sheep 's clothing . 
Do you have an occasion in mind for its unveiling ? I do indeed . 
A new suit for a new era . 
His spirit is strong , and his flesh will follow the spirit . 
That 's a comforting thought . 
You should take comfort from it . 
Now , wouldn 't like to do anything to upset you or your father . 
It 's a free swing , John . 
Geoffrey . 
Sorry to bother , Your Grace . Are you expecting company ? 
Because I have five vehicles in Field Barn Lane . 
No , definitely not . 
Do they look local ? 
No , they don 't look like our average rambler , that 's for sure , sir . 
Right . Stay there . I 'm coming to you . 
" Release your fire on all those that rise against ... " 
Been out checking the nesting boxes and saw this lot . 
- They 've been there about 20 minutes . - Mm . 
Looks like they mean business . Any idea who they 're after ? 
That is a God-fearing , coke-dealing crime lord from Liverpool . None of this is good . 
- Amen . - Amen . 
Freddy , you had any contact with Gospel John recently ? 
Have I had contact with Gospel ... Oh , sure . You know , we text , trade the occasional email about wallpaper ideas . 
Why the fuck would I have any contact with that mad bastard ? 
All right . Tell everyone to stay indoors . Okay . Why ? Wh-What the fuck 's going on ? 
When I know more , I 'll call you , all right ? 
We need to go to my cottage and pick up a few things . 
Little much , isn 't it , Geoffrey ? 
I am employed to kill vermin , Your Grace . 
I did a bad thing , Mama . 
And the fact that man is out there probably indicates he found out . 
Hello , Freddy . 
I 've come to collect a debt . A debt that you owe me . 
Now , we can do this one of two ways . 
You 're coming out , or I 'm coming in . 
- All right , Dad ? How 's it going ? - Don 't worry about me . What 's the latest ? 
Just spoke to the consultant . Jack 's doing well . He 's asleep , but we 're on the right path . 
I had a chat with Eddie . He got me thinking . 
I need you over here tout de suite . And bring the duke with ya . 
- That might be a problem . - Why ? Well , he sold us out , so I sold him out . 
Look , I think you should check your news media , yeah ? I reckon you 're about 24 hours out of date . 
Whatever you 've done , you 'd better undone . I need His Grace , and I need him happy . 
Well , what I 've done is make a call to the Gospel . 
Fuck me , Susie . 
Susie , Gospel John has just pulled up onto my estate . 
Sorry about that , Eddie . That might 've been me . 
Why the fuck would you do that ? 
I had my reasons at the time . Is he there yet ? 
Him and half the Christian brotherhood . 
- Hold tight . Cavalry 's on its way . - Whatever you 're gonna do , do it fast . 
Jimmy , I need you to listen to me very carefully . 
The duke 's in a spot of trouble . 
I 'm sending some boys with a delivery . See they get to the house . 
Ooh , so sorry , John . Uh , my brother 's here . One ... one ... one sec . 
Mr. Dixon . You 're trespassing on private property . 
I just came to return your shotgun . 
- Was going to present it to your brother . - Eddie , I 'm just gonna go out . 
I 'm going to give you five minutes out of respect for the heritage of your family . 
Good . 
Tammy , Mother , close the shutters . Make sure the windows are clear . 
Enough 's enough . 
Guys , I love ya . 
- It 's been nice knowing ya . - Freddy , Freddy ! 
No , this is my mess , and it is time I finally fucking faced up to it . 
- I will not fucking let you . - It 's okay . It 's okay . 
Guys , it 's okay . 
Because this is nothing less than I deserve . 
I am a massive piece of shit . 
Yeah ? And if those guys out there let me live , I 'll just go right back to being a piece of shit . Am I wrong ? 
Edward , am I wrong ? 
Exactly . But it 's okay . 
Because this is the one time I can do something selfless . 
The one chance I have to reclaim a shred of human dignity . 
So don 't take that away from me . 
Don 't do that . 
Freddy , it 's not dignity . It is pain and violence and death . 
Now , we love you . 
And , yes , you can be a bit of a prick . 
- Big prick . - Big prick . Big , old prick . 
But right now , we need you . All right ? 
I need you . 
- All right . - Good . 
Mother , take the staff down to the basement now . 
Yes , I 'll get Charly . 
Please be careful . 
Tammy , close the door . Make sure it 's locked . 
Three of us against an entire fucking crime family ? 
Is there a plan here , Edward ? 
Great , no plan . He gives me the big speech ... Shut up ! What 's your plan exactly ? 
- Kamikaze . - Are you gonna prostrate ... - Your Grace . 
- Like a martyr ? I 've got another five shotguns and a rifle . 
Perfect . All right . 
Five minutes are nearly up , John . Wanna get started ? 
Your Grace , what 's the plan ? 
- Help 's on its way . - Okay . 
This has put a different complexion on things . 
Jimmy , how do you feel about this ? 
Not me , boss . I 'm more of a pacifist . 
Fine . Cellar with Mother and the staff . 
Geoffrey , upstairs with the others . Everyone else , find positions down here . 
Where 's my machine gun ? 
Fuck it . 
You know why I love pigeons so much ? 
They symbolize the harmony of man with nature . 
Even before Noah touched dry land , we were working together , man and bird . 
Have you ever heard of , uh , Cher Ami ? 
Well , the last year of the Great War , 500 French soldiers were trapped behind enemy lines . They were getting shelled by their own firm . 
So this major , he sends the pigeon off for help . 
Now , this pigeon , he gets shot in the breast , loses an eye , his poor little leg is hanging from a strand . But he flies all the way back to base , delivers the message , and the troops are saved . 
Because of that pigeon . 
Now , the French , they awarded the pigeon the Medal of Valor . 
You see , pigeons , they have values . 
Loyalty . Bravery . Integrity . 
I need you two to bury the hatchet , for want of a word . 
The moral of the story is , you need to take the blows , accept the blame , all for the sake of the bigger picture . 
I need you two to be my Chers Amis , ' cause I can 't be dealing with any more shenanigans like this morning . 
No one wants that Scouse headbanger kicking in the front door followed by his army of God-drunk luna-cunts . 
I made it clear to Mr. Dixon that if he went back home , I 'd make it up to him . 
So now , Eddie , you 've gotta make it up to me . 
Sit the fuck down . 
It 's like dealing with a couple of kids . 
I 've been reviewing my situation . I 've come to the conclusion that I 'm done , I 'm out , I 'm finished . 
Jack 's gonna be all right , but I see this as a sign . Uh , an epiphany , so to speak . So I 'm just gonna sell the business . 
Simple as that . 
What does that mean about our deal ? 
I want out . I don 't want to segue from growing weed into mass-producing methamphetamines . 
Yeah , I understand that , and , you know , and I will stand by what I said . You know ? 
You do realize you 're doing exactly what Mr. Johnston wants you to ? 
Mr. Johnston hasn 't got a fucking clue about the nuances of the situation . 
So , no , I ain 't giving no one fuck all . Especially the Septic . 
Now , I 'm gonna be selling to the highest bidder , and I 'll accept offers in excess of 150 mill . All bids have gotta be in by the end of the week . 
All I want you to do is work with Susie and make sure she gets the best deal . 
And why me exactly ? 
It ain 't gone unnoticed that you two have become a right double act working together . 
Why didn 't you say anything back there ? 
You 've been running the operation for years . Gonna let him sell it out from under you ? 
I 'm an employee , Eddie . Just like you . 
What do you mean ? He 's your father . He didn 't even ask your opinion . 
He didn 't ask for yours either . 
You went behind my back , Eddie . Not once , but twice . 
Well , I think it 's safe to say we both made some miscalculations , to put it mildly , but it 's business , Susan . 
Got your way in the end , didn 't you ? 
Dad 's selling up , and you 're getting out . 
What about you ? 
You 're a little young to retire . 
I can think of worse things for the soul than getting my full ten hours and bingo on a Wednesday . 
Quite . 
He 's made up his mind . Let 's just do what the old man says and be done with it . 
I 've made no secret of my desire to take control of your father 's organization . 
I am aware that it 's been faced with serious disruption over the last few months . 
Product gone missing . Pipelines blocked . Punches being thrown . 
We 're aware that you 're behind all of that . But you crossed the line when it came to my brother . 
You rejected my initial approach . 
I needed to convince you and your father that I was in earnest . 
Now , I 'm prepared to enter into negotiations over the peaceful handover of your business , but you must understand that I 'm doing it from a position of considerable strength . 
Ms. Glass , what you seem not to know is that one of your disgruntled staff has leaked to me the 12 addresses of the other farms . 
I 'm afraid not . 
The list that I gave to Mr. Stevens was , in fact , spurious . 
- Hello ? 
- Afternoon . 
Am I speaking with the Marquess of Beaversbrook ? 
Speaking . 
- Baron Noughton ? 
- Hello . 
Viscount Bowling ? 
This is he . 
Oh my goodness . I 'm rather enjoying this . 
Hold on . 
Good afternoon . I 'm calling to discuss your business relationship with a Mr. Robert Glass . 
Yes , carry on . Who am I speaking to ? 
I was under the impression it was verified . 
You 've been the victim of a deception , Mr. Johnston . 
I must admit , I was surprised to see you arriving together . 
Why the change of heart ? Felt like a pivotal moment . So I pivoted . 
What makes you think I 'm interested in the weed game ? 
We understand that you have some serious connections in South America . 
What they 'd be getting is a vertically-integrated business that currently controls close to 50 % of the UK market . 
If and when there 's a mandate for legalization in the UK , you 'll be getting some of the most advanced distribution and development facilities in Western Europe . 
Help you ? I can hook you up with the Russkies , but a word to the wise ... They are fucking hardcore . Make a joke they don 't understand , they 'll throw you out the window . 
The question is , do they have the relevant backing ? 
Oh God . A few hundred 's nothing to these fucking Russians . They are Kremlined-up to the hilt . 
You know I don 't mess around . You 've seen this with your own eyes , yeah ? 
My associates , something else . 
Well , we 're willing to take that risk . 
And what happened between us ... 
Best thing that ever happened to me . 
You see , until you 've had the living shit beaten out of you , you don 't know anything . 
But when you realize the only thing that matters is power , the whole world opens up . ' Cause it 's literally there for the taking . 
And despite your Machiavellian tactics , my father is still willing to sell the business to you , but only if you 're willing to pay more than everyone else . 
Does that explain the presence of the bird ? 
My father is decidedly old school when it comes to business communications . 
He wants all bids sealed , in writing , and delivered by carrier pigeon by the end of the week . 
What 's wrong with an email or a phone call ? 
You 'll have to ask Bobby when you make the winning bid . 
Good afternoon . 
Love the bird , by the way . It 's fucking hysterical . 
I guess that officially brings our business dealings to an end . 
Still got a few more birds left . Might as well let ' em go . They 'll find their way home . 
Poor pigeons , eh ? 
Good luck . 
Good luck . 
It 's been emotional , Captain . 
Mummy , do you think Geoff 's all right ? 
He 's been acting very strangely since I 've been back . 
Uh , well , you know , he 's always been very fond of you . Well , I wouldn 't read too much into it . 
Oh look , there 's Eddie ! Hello . 
Morning . 
If you 're looking for your pigeon , I saw Freddy scuttling off with it earlier . 
Perfect . I should go and rein him in . Thanks for the tip . 
Are you sure everything 's all right ? Yes , Mother . Everything 's fine . 
- Which way did he go ? 
- That way , darling . 
Come on , Mitch . Come on , just eat . 
Please . It 'll make you nice and big and strong . 
Who are you talking to , Freddy ? 
What ? No one . Absolutely no one . I don 't think ... Was I ? Yeah , I don 't think I was ... 
Give me the bird . 
Just one pigeon , okay ? Just one measly fucking pigeon , Eddie . 
I know what you 're gonna say . You 've got some heavy fucking hitters lined up out there . But I 've raised some epic funds in my time . 
- Debts don 't count . 
- Okay . No need to be snarky . The point I 'm trying to make is this . I have been watching you these past couple of months . Observing the way you operate and just soaking it all in , all this crime stuff ... 
Listen to me . All right ? We 're done . 
No more games . No more debts . It 's over . 
Oh , I get what this is . I see . You 're jealous . You want me out the way . 
I think it was you who wanted me out of the way , Freddy . 
Okay . Well ... touché . I probably deserved that . 
- But ... - I 'm taking the pigeon , Freddy . 
I 'm not giving you Mitch , Ed . 
You weren 't meant for this , Freddy . 
Neither of us were . 
Remember that first time Dad took us deer stalking ? Remember that ? 
No , not really . 
We all stalked the deer together , and then Dad let me take the shot . 
And I got it . I fucking got it . 
And he was so fucking proud . 
And then when we got closer ... and it was still breathing ... I couldn 't do it . 
Well , you were just a kid , Freddy . 
You were younger than me . 
Dad handed you the knife , and you slit that thing 's throat like it was fucking nothing . 
The point I 'm trying to make is this , Edward . Maybe you 're right . 
Maybe I 'm not ... cut out for this . 
But you ... You were fucking born for it . 
Look after Mitch for me . 
So sorry for interrupting , Your Grace , but are you all right ? 
It 's just you seem to be having a bit of a moment . 
Not right now , thanks , Jimmy . 
Yeah , ' course . Sorry . 
I need you to draw up some Articles of Association . They don 't need to be legally binding , but I need to lay out terms of a consortium for interested parties . 
Realistically , we need to raise somewhere in the region of 200 to stand a chance . 
The lion 's share of the agreement will come from the other 12 lords . 
If I can convince them to put 10 % in each , we 'll be well on our way . 
Next , we 'll approach our friends in the traveling community . 
They now have significant funds squirreled away from their introduction into the import-export business . 
I 've been wanting to free myself of the Glass family for some time . I 'm now going to lean in , rather than out . 
Well , that should get you a seat at the table , but you 're still significantly short of the number you 're looking to raise . 
With a fair wind , you should be able to pull together 25 , plus the £ 10 million loan from your mother . 
I 've had to sell all my stocks and Mama 's Monet . 
- Thank you , Mother . - That still leaves you a gap of 15 . 
- Right ... - Well , what about Susie Glass ? 
Obviously , you can 't run the business without her . 
She 's not interested . 
I ... I don 't see why not . 
I mean , from what I can gather , she 's been running the entire operation for years . 
It 's rather complicated , Mother . 
It means I have to consider a much more unsavory option . 
Hello , Henry . 
- Cup of tea , please . 
- Coming up . Well , you look a touch peaky . 
You should see a doctor . 
Injuries like mine , they tend to result in the sort of questions I don 't like getting asked . 
Shame your sponsor was unable to find you a sympathetic medical practitioner . 
Although , from what I hear , your business relations with our American friend have since come to an end . 
- Here you are , love . - Thank you . 
You 're clearly well-informed . 
I gave Susie the 15 clean , plus another 15 for Jack 's pocket to say sorry , but I still don 't know if I 'm out of the woods . 
So what do you want to see me about ? 
You know what you 've done . You can 't come back from that . It 's inexcusable . 
I 'm here to explore whether there might be a way for me to change your fortune . 
Oh yeah ? 
I can get you out of all this . But it 's gonna cost you another 15 . 
On top of that , there are a couple of things that need doing . 
What 's on your mind , Eddie ? 
How 's he doing ? 
Sleeping a lot . But improving . 
How are you doing ? 
I don 't know , really . 
Kinda just focused on him at the moment . 
You must be very close . 
He was , uh , ten when our mum passed away . 
Well , that 's a heavy responsibility on young shoulders . 
It never felt like a burden . I loved looking after Jack . I love running the business . 
I know that your father is planning on selling the organization , and you 're probably weighing up what to do . 
So my one piece of advice would be , don 't listen to anyone , least of all my son , and especially not your father . 
However , if you want the benefit from my vast years of experience , I 'd say that you 're much more likely to regret the things that you didn 't do rather than the things that you did . 
Tell me , what is it you 're worried I 'm not gonna do ? 
So I run things on the ground , you take care of the lords , and then this , um , JP fella , he 'd look after distribution ? 
Exactly . Your 15 would give you shared participation and shared ownership . 
You reckon 200 's gonna swing it with Bobby Glass ? 
That 's the number I have in mind , yeah . 
Once the deal 's done , he 's out of the game . 
What about Uncle Stan ? 
I hear his accounts may not be in order . 
I saw your mum at the hospital . 
You 're a right old bag of contradictions , aren 't you , Eddie ? 
Perhaps . 
Is that Scouse brains I can see in the clouds ? 
Well , you could argue he had it coming . 
Do you know what this means ? 
Non sine periculo . It 's our family motto . " Not without danger . " 
It got me thinking . 
Nothing in life worth having comes without a little ... danger . 
See , what I realized is my family have been doing this for generations . 
Living in the zoo , but hunting in the jungle . 
It 's nothing new . It 's just another turn of the wheel . 
Have you managed to pull together the necessary funds ? 
We pulled together a significant amount . But , as you know , it 's a competitive market . 
We would always appreciate further investment . If you 're interested . 
My dad started dealing puff in the ' 70s . That 's almost half a century ago . 
Fair play to him , he built himself an empire . Biggest outfit in the UK . 
But , truth be told , he 's taken his eye off the ball . 
It 's like the goose that lays the golden eggs . As long as the eggs kept popping out , he wasn 't bothered . 
Every time I tried to talk to him about taking things to the next level , he wasn 't interested . 
And look what we 've achieved in a matter of months together . 
You put in 35 , we 'll be equal partners . 
You wanna be partners ? 
But ... we need to talk about Henry Collins . 
I gave him a pass once . It 's not happening again . 
Understandable . 
But I think we need to adjust our expectations . In the short term , at least . 
You must be pretty fucking confident if you 're willing to rattle that cage . 
Supremely . 
Charlotte . 
Let her fly . 
- Ready ? 
- Let 's do it . 
All yours , Geoffrey . 
Good boy . 
Are you tired , eh ? 
Yeah , go and get some munchies , go on . 
Now , that 's a big fucking number . 
Yes , Miss Charlotte ? 
I 've been thinking a lot about my childhood . 
I realized ... you basically taught me everything I know . 
All those times we went camping in the woods . 
And it was you who taught me how to make a fire and how to ride a horse . How to tickle a salmon . 
It was always you . Wasn 't it ? 
I 'm just the gamekeeper , Charlotte . 
Are you sure ? 
' Cause sometimes I wonder , and ... it 'd make a lot of sense . 
Well ... anyway ... 
I didn 't want you to be ashamed . 
I 'd never be ashamed . 
You 're the most impressive man I 've ever known . 
That 's four bids . On the table . 
All north of asking . Well done . 
And I notice you 've , um ... You 've both got your name on one of these . 
That 's a turn up for the books . 
Well , I just wanna let you know that I 'll be , uh , judging these bids on their own individual merits . 
- ' Course . - Perfect . 
But ... So , whose bid actually won ? 
Unfortunately , it 's not as simple as that , Mother . 
As you know , it was a very competitive market , and , uh , we certainly weren 't the highest bid . 
So who did win ? 
Uncle Stan . 
I 'll admit , I felt confident that my bid would be competitive . 
I 'm just glad we got there in the end . 
Mr. Stevens will go to the bank and arrange for the money to be wired to an account of Mr. Glass 's choosing . 
He was willing to pay a premium for the business , so Mr. Glass was eager to interrogate the offer . 
I sense you 're suspicious , Mother , and you 're right to be . 
Truth be told , I had activated Henry Collins , whose accountant knew where Mr. Johnston buries the bodies . 
Thank you for seeing me at such short notice . You 're very welcome , Mr. Stevens . 
These bodies , by which I mean his tax records , were then delivered to the relevant authorities at His Majesty 's Revenue and Customs . 
Leading to Uncle Stan 's arrest for multiple tax evasion offenses and the freezing of all of his assets , leaving him unable to complete the purchase . 
But then , if Uncle Stan 's out of the picture , doesn 't that mean that Pete Spencer-Forbes won after all ? 
That 's what I said to Mercy . 
Sticky Pete . 
Your bid came in second . 
- Don 't worry , Mother . He didn 't win . - I thought you just said he did . 
I told Mercy he won . 
My associates are flying in from Bogotá . I told you , they 're not gonna take no for an answer . 
Well , it 's very hard to get money out of Russia , as you can imagine , which , uh , leaves a certain window of opportunity for someone like yourself . 
Where do I find this Sticky Pete ? 
Mercy was under significant pressure from her South American superiors . 
She took it upon herself to clear the field . 
Henry Collins steps in again to take care of her . 
Oh , well , I 'm glad someone 's looking after her , poor woman . 
- Oh ... - Sorry . Wasn 't Henry Collins the one that fixed the fight ? One and the same . 
Oh , darling , tell me you 're not working with him now . 
Henry fucking Collins . 
Don 't worry about Henry Collins . 
He was desperate , so I used him to clean up . 
Fifteen mill . As discussed . 
Take a seat , please , Henry . 
The whole point of me telling you I was selling my business was to wake you up . 
You 're not buying the operation . You 're investing in it . 
So together , we can expand our interests . 
I take it you 're not retiring , then , Dad . Eh ? 
No chance . 
But I needed to know you two were willing to put some skin in the game . 
Shared responsibilities have their merits . 
And the benefits of continuity are not to be sniffed at either . 
Eddie , you are a soldier . You are an aristocrat . But I see a man who isn 't defined by titles . Or limited by them . 
So we have a deal . 
£ 235 million . 
Now you have a purpose . 
You wasn 't born to take orders . You were born to give ' em . To build and expand empires . 
I don 't see a captain . I see a fucking general . 
- Aw , you shouldn 't have . 
Do you wanna do it ? 
Is that a request ? No . You don 't have to . 
I thought you might want to . 
You know , as part of your ... " journey . " 
Easy on the sauce , Chef . 
Don 't worry about it . I mean , prison ain 't that bad once you get used to it . 
There 's plenty of sleep , regular exercise , and , uh , not too many interruptions . 
And now that Mr. Kawasaki 's lost his parole , I can guarantee the quality of the cuisine for at least another year . 
Ah , that 's lovely . 
One could do a lot worse . 
Spoken ... like a true gentleman .
