You need to finish the cordon by 14 : 00 , but , um , otherwise , great work . 
- Okay , boss . - Mm-hmm . 
No , no , no , no , no , no , listen . 
Listen to me . Tell them I don 't care whose goats they are , just get them off the road . 
Relax , Sergeant . Hold on . 
Don 't want to cause an international incident . 
Right , gentleman with the mustache , head in that direction , please . 
Gentleman with the eye patch , head in the opposite direction . 
If we can 't sort this out amicably . We 'll let the goats decide . 
- Don 't cock this up . 
Bobby ! 
You all right ? 
- This man 's papers are out of date . - Let me have a look . 
- Hello . - Hello . 
- Yeah , it 's only three days . 
Tell them they can come through this time , but this time only . - Get them to sort it out for their return . 
- Smithy . 
- Boss . 
- Everything all right ? 
- I 'm on it . - No , no . 
- I 'll sort this . You stay here . - Sir . 
Ah . Hello , sir . 
Good afternoon , sir . 
Ahmed . 
I assume this isn 't good news . 
It was a nasty fall . 
- Well , you could 've just called me . - We did , sir . Many times . 
Ultimately , your brother decided , as the eldest son , that it was necessary to dispatch me so that I could impress upon you the severity of the situation . 
Is my father gonna die , Ahmed ? 
His Grace 's condition is ... serious . 
My instruction is to take you to the airport straight away . 
It 's all been cleared with your superiors . 
Right . 
Let 's go . 
Sergeant . 
Anything we can do to help , sir ? 
You 're in charge now , Charlie . 
Till I get back . 
Welcome home , sir . 
- Did you miss me , Mr. Lawrence ? - Terribly . 
Hello , Freddy . 
Eddie . 
Edwina , Eduardo , you made it . Come to me . Well done , darling boy . 
Well done . Let 's hug it out . 
Bring it in . Hug it out . 
Good to see you . 
How is he ? 
Shit , mate , to be honest . Yeah . 
I mean , his goose is ... well and truly cooked . 
Doc says it 'll be tonight , tomorrow morning latest . Hmm . What about you ? How you doing ? 
To be honest , I 've got absolutely no idea . I mean , I 'm really just , you know ... 
How 's Mum ? 
Yeah , she 's the one we need to keep an eye on . 
Pretty sure she 's been dipping her beak in Dad 's meds . She 's got eyes like fucking ... hubcaps . 
Right . 
- Let 's keep it together . - Okay . 
Of course , by that time , he 's three sheets to the wind , stark-bollock naked . 
He 'd just forgotten he was in the Upper Chamber . 
- Well , how the devil ... - Hello , Chuckles . 
- You okay ? - Yeah . 
How is he ? Is he lucid ? 
Oh , sometimes . He 's a bit ... in and out . 
- When he 's there , he 's ... definitely there . 
Hi , Mum . 
- Darling , thank goodness . 
He 'll be glad you came , even if he doesn 't show it . 
Shall we go out ? Come on , darling . 
The first Duke of Halstead was tough as iron . 
Built this place himself . 
Every stone of it . - Single-handed . 
- Dad ... 
Pinched the stone from the old monastery . 
It 's me , Edward . 
Why 'd you turn your back on us , my boy ? 
Do you think it 's brave to go swanning off playing tough-tough with your friends ? It 's not . The estate is not to be carved up . Is that clear ? 
Don 't worry about that . Just get some rest . 
And look after your brother . 
He won 't survive without you . 
You understand ? 
I understand , Dad . 
The third duke , mean old bastard , killed 15 Frenchmen before lunch . 
He was getting himself ready to fight a duel . He shot his own foot off . 
Silly cunt . 
Doctor ? 
Eddie . 
And the blessing of God Almighty , 
The Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit , be upon you and remain with you always . 
Amen . 
This estate has been in the family for over 600 years , and Freddy 's gonna ... ... the lot by Christmas . 
- We should do something about it , Edward . 
If Dad left it to you , you 'd spend it all rewilding bears in Berkshire . What 's wrong with bears ? I like bears . 
They leave no carbon footprint , and they were here before us . 
Yes , and they 'll fucking eat you . 
Anyway , it 's irrelevant . 
The entire estate gets handed down to the firstborn son . 
Freddy 's the heir , and I 'm the spare . 
- Maybe we should topple him together . - Hmm . 
Now , there 's an idea . 
I 'm so sorry I 'm late . 
And here he is . 
Your Grace . 
These narrow country lanes ... 
You all right ? Yeah , good . Hang in there . 
- Won 't be a moment . 
- Cup of tea ? You all right ? 
Stuck behind a tractor half the way as well . 
Smashing . Smash-a-roosies . - No , no , no . - Right . 
- Is everyone ready ? 
Let 's get it over with . Let 's get it over with . 
Then I 'll begin . 
" I , Archibald Horatio Landrover Horniman , the 12th Duke of Halstead , being of sound mind do make , publish , and declare this to be my last will and testament . " 
" To Geoffrey Seacombe , in acknowledgement of his years of faithful service , I leave a lifetime tenancy on the gatekeeper 's cottage . " 
" To my wife , Sabrina , for her loyalty and faithfulness throughout our many happy years together , I leave an annual allowance that the new duke shall bestow at his discretion and my beloved Labrador , Luna . " 
" To my daughter , Charlotte , I leave the Endurance , with the condition that she sail around the world on her in the next six months . " 
Well done , Chuckles . 
" As well , a trust fund of Â £ 1,000 a week until she marries a man . " Wow . 
" In terms of the rest of my estate , including my title , the house and grounds , the extensive wine cellar , the art collection , the yogurt farm and dairy , the village of Hetheringham , as well as the property in the South of France , I hereby leave to my son ... " All right , um ... 
" ... Edward Horniman . " 
So I think , um ... I was kind of thinking if everybody ... 
Sorry . A-Again for me , old chap . 
" I leave to my son Edward Horniman . " 
I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry this has happened to you . There must be some sort of ... It 's ... 
He 's Edward . I 'm Freddy . 
Sometimes they call me Fredward , and so it gets a little bit ... mixed up . 
I think there 's some sort of mistake , unfortunately . 
I don 't think so . 
I get it , you 're kidding . You 're kidding around . Was this ... This is ... 
Did you ... ? Did you arrange ... ? This is a joke , right ? This ... this is a sick joke . 
I 'm the eldest fucking son ! 
It was all supposed to go to me ! What ... what ... what ... 
- What the fuck is this ? - No . 
There has to be ... No , no , don 't touch me . 
Freddy ! Freddy , relax . 
- Don 't you start . 
- There 's got to be some mistake . 
I 'm the firstborn son , yeah ? 
That means , technically , the title goes to me . 
That 's not just me saying it ' cause it 's what I want . It 's ... it 's the fucking law . It goes back to the Bible , Old Testament , Cain and Abel . 
It 's the will of God . 
The firstborn son gets everything . 
It 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's primogenital , is what it is . 
Primogeniture , Freddy . 
That 's what I said . You know that 's what I said . 
- You 've heard of that , haven 't you ? 
- Of course . But the will is clear . The estate goes to Edward , and the title contains a special remainder that allows it to pass to the second son ... 
Oh , I 'm so sorry . I don 't give a good God shit what the terms of the will clearly state ! 
" The right of succession to the firstborn , legitimate male child ... " 
- Did you actually print that out ? - Freddy ... 
I don 't wanna hear from you either , Lady Macbeth . Absolutely not , no . 
" ... to inherit the parents ' entire estate . " 
The house , the title , fucking everything , it all goes to me ! 
Why are you shaking your head ? What are you , a cocktail ? Don 't you shake your head at me ! 
- Meeting adjourned , Your Honor . - Freddy ... 
Everybody , let 's ... Pack it up . - We 'll pick it up later on . - No , no . 
It 's over . 
You can go home , thank you very much , Mr. fucking Smithers . 
Mr. Burns . 
No , it 's not happening . It 's not happening . 
Haha , good one ! 
I 'm so sorry . No . 
I think we 'll reconvene next week when Freddy 's calmed down . - Talk over details . 
- He took it badly . He 's coming back . 
Perfect . Absolutely not , no . No . No . No . 
I am not fucking having it ! 
Take it up with God ! 
Take it up with the prime minis ... Take it up with the House of fucking Commons ! Or take it up the arse for all I care . 
I want what is rightfully mine by divine motherfucking provenance , yeah ? ! 
I 've been stabbed in the heart ! 
I 've been London Bridged ! 
I 've been fucked in the face ! 
Dogged on the floor ! 
Et tu , Brute ? 
How did you do it , Judas ? 
All of you , a conspiracy of snakes ! 
His Grace comes to gloat . 
I had no idea . I 'm just as surprised as you are . 
It 's not the same sort of surprise , though , is it ? 
For the first time in 600 years , this family has broken with tradition . 
You fucking leapfrogged over your older brother ! 
Not very fraternal , is it , Edward ? 
Thank you , Wham Tam . 
I 'll deal with this . I 'll be up shortly . 
How do you think that makes me look , Eddie ? 
How do you think it makes me feel ? How do you think it helps me pay my fucking debts ? 
Debts , Freddy ? 
What kind of debts ? Big fucking debts . 
That sounds ominous . Yeah , you think ? 
Story , Freddy . 
Do you remember Pete Forbes Spencer ? He was in my house at Eton . 
Big hair , tiny cock , sweaty hands . They called him Sticky Pete . 
I remember Pete , but I don 't remember his cock . 
Started making a fortune in property . People were queuing in droves to get in . 
I gave him one million , got 1.5 back three months later . It was un-fucking-believable . 
Next project , skyscraper in the Maldives . First one . First time . First come , first served . 
One , two , three , four million . Bosh . 
And ? 
Well , then ... 
And then what , Freddy ? 
Then the tits went up . The hurricane hit . The plane crashed . The lightning struck . 
The torpedo went Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . What do you want me to say , Eddie ? 
It wasn 't my fault . God fucked me ! 
Where did you get Â £ 4 million from , Fredward ? 
Well , that came from Tommy Dixon . Right . 
And who 's Tommy Dixon ? 
A chap I met in rehab . Liverpudlian chop dealer . 
Said he wanted to front me the money . Said he wanted " into the Maldives . " 
So , for clarity , you owe a Scouse cocaine dealer Â £ 4 million ? 
I owe a Scouse crime family ... 
We 're coming for you , Freddy . 
... Â £ 8 million . 
Hold on , Freddy . Four to eight . Throw me an anchor . 
I don 't know , Eddie . Criminal compound interest . 
Whatever , okay ? 
They 're gangsters . They fucking make it up as they go along ! 
All right , mate ? 
25 % every week until the debt 's paid . 
And they 're not afraid of getting nasty when you don 't pay up on time . 
If I don 't come up with the money by the end of the week , they 're gonna chop my fucking dick off . 
Which is fatal , by the way . I looked it up . 
I can 't give you Â £ 8 million , Freddy . 
You stole my title . You stole my money . And now you stole the only way I had of getting out of this hole that God fucking dug for me ! 
Lest we forget , sir , you owe me your life . 
When you were three , I pulled you out of the duck pond , remember ? 
No , I don 't remember that . But I do remember you telling me about it incessantly . 
The point is , I saved your life . Now I 'm the one lying face down in the water , and you have got to pull me out . 
Freddy ... I didn 't ask for any of this . 
The title has no practical value . 
The business is broken . There are holes in the roof . The government is greedy . 
The payroll is ugly . The staff are revolting . And you are a coke-sniffing cunt . 
However , because you 've been passed up and you 've been caught with your pants down ... I 'll look into it for you . 
Daddy , what have you been up to ? 
Edward Horniman for Ahmed Iqbal . Thank you . 
How may I help you , Your Grace ? 
I need to get a large amount of cash by the end of the week . 
How much exactly ? 
Eight million pounds . 
Goodness . Jesus Christ . 
Six million sterling . 
Your inheritance has made you a very wealthy man , but that doesn 't mean to say that you 're rich . 
You 're asset rich , cash poor . 
Tell me , how come there are no significant transactions in any of my father 's bank accounts in the last five years ? 
Your father 's personal expenditure was something we never discussed . 
Right . 
What about bonds , stocks and shares ? 
- There aren 't any . - There ... ? 
There might have been matters we ... didn 't address . But , of course , I couldn 't comment . 
Well , that 's rather cryptic , Ahmed . 
You could sell the Gainsborough . But to attain the ultimate value will take a number of months . 
There has been a ... slightly unconventional approach from a lawyer based in London . 
His client has expressed an interest in purchasing Halstead Manor . 
When someone dies , the vultures start circling . 
Rather cheeky , isn 't it ? 
What 's his name ? 
The potential purchaser wishes to remain anonymous at this stage . 
But his lawyer has stated that he 'd be willing to pay well above the market value . 
That could be a significant sum . But there 's probate and capital gains to take into account . 
Tell them I 'd be willing to potentially entertain an offer if he 's aggressive and quick . 
Forgive me for stating the obvious , but I would be in remiss of my duties not to point out that Halstead Manor 's been in your family for generations . 
Since 1550 . 
But as I said , I need money by the end of the week . 
- Set up a meeting , please . - Understood . 
Sorry to disturb you . 
Allow me to introduce myself . 
I 'm Susie Glass . 
How can I help you , Ms. Glass ? 
I used to be in business with your father . 
Well , forgive my confusion , but my father wasn 't exactly known for his business acumen . 
I have certain ... interests I need to discuss with you . 
What kind of interests ? 
Probably easier if I just show you . 
I liked your father . 
He was a proper gentleman . 
A tad eccentric , but your lot are . 
Must 've come as a bit of a shock , inheriting everything . The house . The title . 
Worse things have happened to me . 
Did he mention the revenue he was making from the farm ? No , he didn 't . Couldn 't have been significant , otherwise I 'd have known about it . 
Depends what you consider to be " significant . " 
He was making Â £ 5 million in cash a year . Plus profit share . 
Excuse me ? Five million pounds ? 
I 'm guessing it wasn 't from yogurts and burgers , Ms. Glass ? 
Follow me . 
Now , what happens down there ? 
What the fuck is going on ? 
The cannabis market in the UK is worth over six billion a year . 
Now , we 've managed to corner a substantial share of that market , but the challenge is finding the space to grow it . That 's where your father came in . 
In return for a generous consideration , he let us carry out our activities with the necessary impunity . 
Turns out there ain 't that many 15,000-acre estates where you can do whatever you want without anyone knowing . 
- What 's this one called , Jimmy ? 
- Frisian duck . 
Very popular right now . 
This is Jimmy . He 's been product supervisor here for ... How long 's it been now , Jimmy ? 
Three years now , boss . That 's how long I 've been living under your gaff . 
I can 't believe we finally get to meet ! 
Me and you , we 's like fam . 
Except you , you 's like a duke , innit ? 
Nice to finally meet you , Jimmy . 
Assuming my father was receiving about ... 10 % a year , which would seem fair , this place must be turning over 50 million a year . 
You 're in the right ballpark . 
And being that you said you have a substantial share of the market ... One would assume " substantial " means half or more . That means this is a very small cog in a much larger machine . 
You must have dozens of places like this all over the country . 
Your father never concerned himself with the workings of the wider operation . 
Well , I 'm very curious . 
All you need to know is that we have an agreement that means , as the new landlord , you will receive a significant amount of money every year in return for letting us carry out our activities . 
Well , the trouble is , I might have to put the house on the market . 
We 'd prefer to keep things as they are . 
I 'm sorry if that puts you in an awkward position , Ms. Glass , but it 's my house , and my hand might be forced . 
I completely understand , Your Grace . 
What if I wanted to renegotiate ? 
If you were serious about wanting to sell the property , that would be ... challenging for us . 
- Legally , there 's nothing you can do . - You 're right . 
There 's nothing legal we could do about it . 
Is that a threat I sense in the equation ? 
Absolutely not . 
Look , it 's a lot to take on board . I can understand that . 
Normally in these kinds of situations , certain discussions have been made beforehand . 
And normally , the weak-willed , work-shy , public school-educated heir takes the money and rolls over like a good little boy . 
I wouldn 't put it quite like that . But yeah . 
See how you feel once it 's percolated . Would you like a lift back to the house ? 
No , thanks . I 'll walk . 
Your Grace . 
Oh , hello , Geoff . 
Found her wandering around the lake . I was gonna take her up to Your Ladyship 's . 
Actually , Geoff , wouldn 't mind a chat , if you have the time . 
Well , I normally have a cup of tea around this time of day . 
Perfect . 
How long have you been working here , Geoff ? What is it , 20 years ? 
I 'm not good with years . But you and your brother were still in shorts . 
I know you 've always been incredibly loyal to my father . 
Gave me an opportunity when I was in a bit of bother . 
Didn 't have to , but he did , and that 's what counts . 
I also know that nothing happens on this estate without you knowing about it . 
That 'd be fair to say . 
So I assume you have some understanding of what 's going on . 
That would also be fair to say . 
- Milk , one sugar ? - Thank you . 
I see you 've been introduced to Ms. Glass . 
Which also makes me think you also know what 's been going on . 
What 's the extent of your involvement ? 
I make it my business not to be my business . 
15,000 acres is enough to keep me busy . 
Especially when you take in every wounded animal you come across . 
It 's like a bloody zoo in here . 
Yeah , Charlie got hit by a car . Sarah-Jane flew into a window . 
My little mate here , she 's got a broken leg . 
Is that a fox , Geoff ? 
Aren 't you employed to cull foxes ? 
Is there something specific you wanted to ask me , Your Grace ? Yes . 
My father was happy with the status quo . I 'm not sure I 'm entirely comfortable with it . 
Well , that could be difficult . 
These are serious people , by all accounts . 
So you think I should just keep the money and keep schtum ? 
Worked for your father , more or less . 
Now they got their roots in . 
The trouble is , I 've run into a spot of bother . And for various reasons , I need their help . 
Help , they 'll give ya . But it 'll come at a price . 
- What do you know about them ? 
- They 're dangerous bastards . 
At the end of the day , they 're businessmen . 
As long as you 're gonna make ' em money , they 'll have a conversation with ya . 
You need to be careful . 
Although they appear to be house-trained , don 't be deceived by the facade . 
Hi , Ahmed . Edward Horniman . 
I 've decided to take the house off the market . 
- Thank you , Bradley . 
Ah . Morning , Chuckles . Edwina . 
Like some tea ? 
I don 't have time . I 've got a train to catch . 
Dressed for your world tour ? Do I look like I 'm dressed for a world tour ? No . 
Mummy 's persuaded me to go back to uni to finish the year . 
Sounds surprisingly sensible . 
Freddy 's the one she should be worrying about . 
Don 't you worry about Freddy . 
I 'll look after Freddy . 
- Would you like a hand with your bags ? - You ? The gentleman ? 
- Bradley . 
- Of course , Your Grace . 
Good luck , Chuckles . 
Your Grace . 
Come on , Bradley , chop chop . 
Oi , Jacky ! Come here . 
It 's the duke . 
Hi there , Your Grace . 
I need to raise Â £ 8 million very quickly . 
Oh , eight million . That 's a big number . 
My brother 's in debt to a Liverpudlian drug cartel . 
- What did he say the guy 's name was ? 
- Tommy Dixon . 
I know him . 
- How much of the eight 's interest ? 
- Half . 
That 's strong . 
The interest rate wasn 't made clear on the inception of the loan . 
And , obviously , my options are severely limited in terms of raising the required funds , given our business agreement . 
Let me see what I can do . 
How much do you reckon you 'd be able to get ? 
Not sure . I 'm working on it . 
If you can take care of four , I 'll see what I can do with the other four . 
I 'll get back to you . 
What do you reckon , bruv ? 
I know Tommy Dixon . And his brother , The Gospel . 
Pair of drug-dealing Scousers that have got God on their side . 
Naughty ? 
Naughty but not double naughty . 
I reckon you can squeeze him . Once they know who our dad is . 
Where can I find them ? 
Fish market . He hides behind the mackerel . That 's their front . 
Come on , Jacky ! 
Go on . Get back to it . 
Elmo , incoming , son . 
Try not to hurt yourself . 
My name is Stevens . 
I 'm the personal assistant to a private individual who 's interested in purchasing Halstead Manor . 
I must say , my client was somewhat disappointed to hear you 'd instructed your lawyers to pull out of negotiations before he 'd had the chance to counter with a more ... attractive offer . 
That notwithstanding , my client would like to see if you 'd be open to a face-to-face meeting . 
Who exactly is your client ? 
If you 're willing to come with me , I could have you sitting with him by , ooh , elevenses . 
Thank you , but my situation has changed . I am no longer selling . Mr. Lawrence . 
My client understands that this represents a considerable inconvenience to yourself . 
So ... he 'd like to make you an offer . 
250,000 Great British pounds . For your time . 
Non-recoupable , of course . 
Would you care to follow me , Your Grace ? 
Handsome-looking turbot . 
Two and a half kilos . Not bad for a wild fish . 
All right , sweetheart . You looking or buying ? 
Neither . I 'm here for you . 
My name 's Susie Glass . 
Eloquent and stylish daughter of Bobby Glass ? 
I respect Bobby . 
Everyone respects Bobby . 
Can we have a little convo about Freddy Horniman ? 
25 % a week , son . Till the debt 's paid . 
Let 's go upstairs . 
So I hear your dad 's caught a nasty cold . 
How long 's he got left ? 
He 's four into a ten stretch . 
I 've heard nothing but good things about your operation . 
I used to think the puff game was too much hassle . 
Too bulky , not enough return . 
Sounds like you 've got it under manners . 
We 've always steered clear of the powder . Means we 're not in competition with each other . 
What I can 't understand is , what 's the connection with you and that posh twat ? 
I have a business interest that could be put in jeopardy by this little debt of his . 
And I wanted to see if there was a way we might be able to resolve it . 
Eight million 's a lot of money . 
But 100 % of fuck all is fuck all . 
Look , we both know you 're not gonna get the full eight , so let 's be realistic . 
What happens if I can get you the original four in cash by the end of the week ? 
I can 't just write off four million in interest . 
What about if we treat it as an investment into your operation ? 
No , that 's not gonna work . I 'm not looking for investors . 
But I am still trying to find a way through this . Somehow . 
- When would I get the four million ? 
- You can pick it up on Friday . Sweetened with a bar 's worth of white widow super cheese . 
All right . 
On one condition . 
He 's got to apologize . And he 's got to admit that he 's a cock . 
Understood . 
And I want it recorded for posterity . 
There 's a video I would like him to emulate . 
Right . 
Well , there 's videos and there 's videos . 
It 's nothing nasty . 
So , if I get you the four and the super cheese and the video , with an apology , are we good ? 
Oh aye , yeah . You get me all that , we 're golden . 
Thank you , Jeffrey . 
Sir , the Duke of Halstead , Edward Horniman . 
- Good morning . 
- Pleasure , Your Grace . 
Stanley Johnston . With a ' T ' . 
You 'd probably like to know why I am so interested in buying your family estate . 
I would , rather . 
Thank you , Stevens . 
The truth is , it 's a paragon of an example of the architectural philosophy of William Kent , who was a jack of all trades . And a master of some . 
So you 're familiar with his philosophy ? 
Wasn 't it something to do with the reconciliation of the feral with the refined ? 
A worthy obsession that we both share . 
People either survive in the jungle or exist in the zoo . 
Few recognize the significance of the paradoxical reconciliation of the two . 
It takes a rare individual who understands how cunning and aggressive one has to be to acquire an estate such as yours . 
Your house is a testament to the synthesis of this culture . 
Refinement with aggression . 
The first duke understood this principle , as do I. 
Which is why I intend to offer you an obscene amount of money for your country estate . 
Well , that 's a compelling sales pitch . 
But if you put it like that , you run the danger of selling it back to me . 
Now , shall we play or shall we talk ? 
Do you drink wine ? 
Value is derived from what someone 's willing to pay for something . 
If I say it 's worth that much , it 's worth it . At least to me . 
Well , that 's quite a number . 
And I appreciate the lengths you 've gone to present it to me . 
I 've changed my mind , however . The land 's not for sale . 
Thank you . 
I hope you don 't disapprove in the way I prefer my wine presented . In breaking with tradition . I like to decant and clean the liquid . Clear the bottle of any sediment . Then return the wine so it can be enjoyed in its original housing . 
Speaking of housing , I 'm prepared to go farther north of that number . 
Why don 't you allow me to provide the keys to free yourself from your inherited legacy ? 
It may be surprising to you , but I appreciate the paradoxical blessing and curse of your perceived privilege . 
Well , I appreciate the appreciation . But timing is everything , and now is not the right time . 
Stevens , please . 
Mr. J. 
- Thank you . 
- My pleasure . 
Yummy . 
The RomanÃ © e-Conti 2002 . 
- Are you a fan of DRC ? 
I 'm more of a Bordeaux man myself . 
But my father , he was all about the Burgundy . 
He collected the DRC . 
Have you ever tried an ' 82 ? 
I understand there are only six cases left in the world . 
Eight , actually . 
Two belong to the Crown Estate . One belongs to the Archduke of Moldova . And the rest ... Well , they 're in our cellar . 
Along with two cases of the ' 45 . 
Ah , the temptation is too much . 
If you won 't allow me to buy the house , please allow me to buy the wine . 
I promise I will be very generous . 
What about the wine ? 
That could reach three , but , again , that will take time . 
It 'd be very hard for me to let that go . 
- Your Grace . 
- Mr. Stevens . 
Let 's go . 
- My father 's wine collection . - In paper . Exactly what we need . 
That , plus the money in the safe , should clear my brother 's debt . 
Assuming your conversation with Mr. Dixon went well . 
There 's a couple of caveats . 
But he 's agreed to accept the four as long as it 's cash and tomorrow . 
Eight to four . That 's very impressive . 
Think of it as a gesture of goodwill . From me . 
Everything all right ? 
No , not really . 
Eddie , Eddie , Eddie , Eddie . 
Edwina , just hear me out , okay ? This guy 's a two-time world heavyweight champion . 
- How much did you put on ? 
- Yeah , well , all of it . 
It 's a dead cert , bro . Winner takes all . I met his trainer . 
What 's the name of the bookie you made the bet with ? Tell me now . 
There 's no bookies in this kind of fight . It 's very exclusive and off the record . It 's V-V-VIP . 
Hold on . How did you place a bet if there 's no bookie , Freddy ? 
Through a friend of a friend . 
What do you mean , " a friend of a friend " ? Who ? 
Pete . He 's got a mate who put five mill on the guy . - He 's cutting me in . 
- Jesus fucking Christ . Sticky Pete ? 
Haven 't you learnt your lesson ? 
Look , he wants to make amends , Eddie . 
There 's no way this guy 's not gonna win . It 's Joey Bang * Bang . 
Tell Pete you made a mistake . Tell him you 're sorry , and get my fucking money back . 
Gotta go . They 're putting phones in Kevlar bags . That 's how exclusive this place is . 
- Freddy , listen to me . 
Freddy ! - Okay , gotta go . Love you . Bye . 
Ooh , it 's fight night , phone man . 
I 'm feeling good . 
- We 're gonna need to find this fight . 
- I know a man . 
- All right , Suze ? - Jacky boy . 
Your Highness . 
Jack . 
- You got the readies ? 
- Yeah . Here you go . 
- 200 , yeah ? - Mm . I can 't make no promises . 
I 'll have a word with the geezer on the door , see what he can do . 
Don 't move . 
Your brother seems functional . That must be useful . 
- He 's not always that functional . 
- Why , what 's his vice ? 
- His cock . 
- What does he do with it ? 
Usual thing . Just a lot of it . 
So I managed to snag you a couple of tickets . 
But listen , you 've gotta remember , this fight 's completely off the books . 
Results stay in the room as these are both world champion boxers . 
They don 't wanna lose their ranking . 
And , Suze , no grief . It 's my name on the line tonight . 
- All right . 
- Enjoy . 
Come on . Let 's get the money back . 
It 's not often they put on these get-togethers . 
That table 's flown in from Vegas . 
Gypsy Kid 's very popular with our friends across the Atlantic . 
The big ticket 's Joey Bang * Bang . 
You 've got the Americans . Then you 've got the Albanians . The Chinese . 
The Russians , sitting happily next to the Ukrainians . 
And then the traveling community . 
Get him ! 
Nothing brings people together like a spot of blood on the canvas . 
There 'll be 50-100 million British pounds rattling around in here tonight . 
Yeah . And a few of those are mine . 
Psychology , baby . 
Edwina , how the fuck did you get in ? - Money . - What money ? Freddy 's money . Which is my money . 
Nothing I can do about that now . Fight 's started . 
Eddie , I 've got this under control , okay ? 
Freddy , I 'll deal with you later . 
You need to find whoever laid the bet and get my money back . 
Will you relax ? There 's no way Bang * Bang 's gonna lose . 
He 's pulverizing him . You 're ruining the experience . 
It 's fight night , okay ? Fight night ! 
Can we talk about this in a minute ? Listen to me , Peter . 
Without knowing it , you have stepped into a world that you are not familiar with . 
That money is expected by someone who will not suffer disappointment . 
Oh , I 'm sorry . That sounds like a threat . It 's not my problem . It 's yours . 
It 's gonna be your fucking problem . 
Your brother put that money on Joey Bang * Bang . 
Joey wins , your brother 's about to double his money . If he loses , that money doesn 't belong to him anymore , and there 's nothing anyone can do about it . 
Take it easy . 
Susie Glass wants to see you . 
I 'm not done with you . Okay , whatever . Why don 't you fuck off ? 
Thank you , Roger . 
- How 'd that work out ? 
- Not as well as I would have liked . 
Well , sit down , have a drink , watch the fight . We 'll figure something out . 
You got this , Bang * Bang . You got this , baby girl . 
What ? What is it ? 
It 's a scam . 
What do you mean , it 's a scam ? 
He never places the bets , mate . 
He preys on the posh . Only rinses the privileged . 
Then he protects himself with plastic gangsters that he 's immersed himself with , and your lot are too intimidated to complain . 
You never placed the fucking bet . 
That 's a very serious allegation , Your Grace . 
The fundamental rules of gambling are very simple . Uh , when you lose , you pay up . 
What do you think , John ? 
I think you should fuck off back to your country house and wank off your spaniel . 
Get your hands off me . 
Careful , posh boy . 
We know where you live , and we do knock on doors . 
You 're embarrassing yourself . 
You 're not in the army anymore . You 've got nothing to back you up . 
Why 's he lying on the ground ? Someone get him up off the ground ! 
No ! No ! Fuck off . No ! 
Any evolution ? No . 
We need to leave . Now . 
Do you mind if I talk to him ? 
Once things have calmed down . 
Does the name Stanley Johnston ring a bell ? 
No , why ? 
He 's the chap I just sold the wine to . He is very interested in buying the estate . 
And the kind of money he was offering suggested he might know something about the operation . 
- What did you say his name was ? 
- Stanley Johnston . 
With a ' T ' . 
What did you say to him ? 
I said it wasn 't for sale . Well done . That 's the correct answer . 
Take a look at this . 
What is it ? 
The lyrics to a song Freddy 's gotta sing when he hands the money over . 
And he 's gotta dance . Like a chicken . 
Like a chicken ? 
Like a chicken . 
Why does he have to dance like a chicken ? 
Because Tommy Dixon , understandably , needs an apology . 
Party time . 
" I 'm a posh twat who fucked up , ee-i-ee-i-o . " 
" I fucked up because I 'm a knob , ee-i-ee-i-o . " 
" With a twat , twat here , and a twat , twat there . " 
How old is Tommy Dixon ? 
It 's a small price to pay . 
Want us to count it ? Guy said it 's all there . 
- No , I 'm good . 
- You sure ? 
It 'll just take a little while . 
No , come on , let 's go . 
All right . 
I think he wants to say sorry . 
Do you want an apology ? 
I don 't know . 
Yes , you do . We need closure . 
Blanket ! 
One Sticky Pete . 
I just wanted to say sorry from the bottom of my heart . 
Ah , that 's nice , innit , Eddie ? 
I gave you back the money , and I 've said I 'm sorry , so are we cool ? 
I don 't know . 
Are we cool , Edward ? 
Yeah . Yeah , we 're cool . 
You said you were gonna talk to him . 
Oh , we did . 
Don 't worry about him . We did him a favor . 
We discipline the dog , not the man . 
What 's that supposed to mean ? 
There 's a dog in a man that the man can 't control . So we had to control it for him . 
Know what the fundamental challenge with the human condition is ? No . 
But filling in the blanks , is it too much dog and not enough man ? 
Too much untrained dog . And we are in the dog training business . 
Oh , for fuck 's sake ! I 've missed ten on the bounce , Geoff . 
There 's a problem with the weighting . They 're flying too fast . 
This time , we don 't shoot at the target . We shoot four feet in front of it . 
That 's exactly what I 'm doing , Geoffrey . 
Well , this time , we try and miss it in front . 
Smashed it ! 
Natural-born killer , Your Grace . Well done , Fredward . Ah , Edwina . 
Yes , please , Mr. Lawrence . 
- Wham Tam . 
- Edwina . 
- How did you get on with Pete ? 
- I got the money back . What ? How come ? 
He never placed the bet . 
- What do you mean he never placed the bet ? 
- I mean he never placed the bet . 
Oh , that fucking ... 
But Mr. Dixon has agreed to take the four , which means we 're good for tomorrow . 
Well , fuck a duck . Well played . How 'd you manage that ? 
Four million off the eight . I mean ... Christ . I 'd suck his cock for four big ones . 
That 's good to know , Freddy . 
There is , however , one minor caveat . 
- What do you mean , " minor caveat " ? 
He wants you to say you 're a cock . 
He wants me to ... 
Fine . I 'm a cock . 
There . Fucking easy-peasy . No problem . 
Good . 
Everyone thinks I 'm a cock anyway , right ? He does . Pete does . 
Dad definitely fucking did , or he wouldn 't have cut me out of his will . 
What about you ? Do you think I 'm a cock ? 
- Well , you have been a bit of a cock . - Right , okay . 
Doesn 't mean you always are . 
Well , that 's just fucking ... 
Geoff ? Do you think I 'm a cock ? 
Cheers , Geoff . Wham Tam , what about you ? Am I a cock ? 
All men are cocks , Freddy . - Fine , whatever . Anything else ? 
He wants you to do a dance and sing the apology . It 's right here . 
He 's dressed like a chicken . 
Yes . There is that too . 
Fine . 
I 'm a chicken . Cluck , cluck , flap , flap , I 'm so sorry . 
There . What else ? 
He wants to film the performance . 
No . 
I 'm not doing it . I 'm not fucking doing it . 
Hold on . Two minutes ago , you were willing to suck his cock . 
Yeah , in private , Eddie . 
He 's going to film it , Freddy . 
He 's not fucking filming it , Eddie ! 
Yes , he is . 
You asked for my help , and I 'm helping you . 
Not because you fished me out of a pond when I was three , but because you are my brother , and that 's what brothers do . 
As a result , you have to do everything that I tell you from now on . 
And if that means dancing like a chicken , you dance like a chicken . 
You don 't dance like a stripper or a bear or a balle-fucking-rina . You dance like a chicken . 
Is that clear ? 
You 've taken everything else from me . Why not take what 's left of my dignity ? 
Is that clear , Freddy ? 
Yes , Your Grace . 
Quite the gaff . 
Thomas . I did say the back door . 
Tradesmen 's entrance . You are a tradesman , after all . 
The trade was I 'm dropping from eight to four . So I think that means I can walk in the front door . 
Come on , then . 
Hey , soft lad , don 't forget the suit . 
- Good afternoon , Mr. Dixon . 
Thanks for making the trip . We appreciate you 're a very busy man . 
Oh , it was a very pretty drive . 
Beautiful countryside . 
That for me , is it ? 
As promised . Would you like to count it ? 
Nah , I 'll let Jethro do that . 
Hey , Jezza , you 're up , mate . 
Hey ! Soft lad ! 
Is it all right if he sets up on that desk there ? 
Yeah , of course . Take a seat . 
He 's got OCD , our Jethro . Takes him a while to get going . Once he does , there 's no stopping him . Right . Shall we get started , then ? 
Uh , yeah , listen , Tommy , about the whole chicken thing , look ... 
I 'm happy to put on the suit . I 'm happy to do the dance , obviously , just to show you how genuinely apologetic I am about this whole thing . But ... you 've got your money , you 'll have had your fun , and I 'll have eaten humble pie . The whole ... the whole pie . 
You don 't have to film it . Do you ? 
That 's why I agreed to take the four instead of the eight . 
You 're thinking about this all wrong . 
Your participation in this movie is gonna earn you four million quid . 
That 's a million quid a minute . 
You 'll be about the best-paid actor in the world . 
You should be celebrating , not negotiating . 
Listen , mate , that shit could follow me around forever . Get your hand off me . 
I 'm not your mate . 
Don 't confuse our roles here . 
Today , you work for me . 
I direct , and you perform . 
And I wanna get value for fucking money . 
Come on , Freddy . It 's just a song . Let 's get it done . 
Suit . Show . Go . 
I need a minute to , uh get prepared . 
Want the wolf in the henhouse ? 
Chicken . Chick ... 
You 're a fucking ... You 're a Scouser , mate . 
Right ! Let 's fucking do this thing . 
Where do you want me ? 
Aren 't you gonna get your camera out ? 
That 's not how this works . 
You 're gonna dance , and then I will judge whether I deem your performance film-worthy . 
Do you know why you 're dressed as a chicken ? 
Oh , I don 't know , to , uh , to humiliate me in front of the whole fucking world ? There 's a reason I didn 't ask you to get dressed as an eagle . Eagles don 't dance . They soar . Through the air . 
But a chicken 's the bottom of the food chain . 
You 're a chicken , aren 't you , Freddy ? 
You had to get bailed out of a debt you couldn 't repay . 
But you can repent . 
My brother 's a big fan of repentance . 
And a proportion of this debt is his . 
He sees this dance as a parable . 
Therefore , you don 't just pretend to be a chicken . You 've gotta actually be a chicken . 
Do you understand ? 
The remedy is in the poison . 
Come on . Let 's see your chicken . 
All right . 
- Let 's see you , come on . - All right ! 
No . What the fuck is that ? 
What the fuck kind of shit chicken is that ? 
Come on , let 's go ! Let 's fucking chicken ! 
Posh twat . 
Waddle like a fucking chicken ! 
Do the sound . 
That 's shit ! 
Move your neck . 
- Be a chicken ! 
- I am a fucking chicken ! 
I want you to be a chicken . 
I want you to feel it . 
I want you to transform into a chicken . 
I don 't want any vestige of humanity left in ya . 
I just wanna see ... bird . 
So come on . 
Let 's see it . 
What are you doing ? That 's not how a chicken walks . Come on ! 
- Come on , peck ! Lay a fucking egg ! - I am fucking pecking ! 
- I 'm pecking ! - Get up on that sofa and fly off . 
I 'm a cock ! 
- Be a chicken ! 
- I can 't actually fucking fly , Tommy ! 
Just be a fucking chicken ! Come here ! 
Come on ! 
Look , there 's all grain there . 
Look , come and peck the grain . Come here . There 's a worm . 
I want you to eat the worm , you fucking chicken ! 
Come here ! There 's a fucking worm here . There 's a worm ! 
Peck the grain ! Peck it , come on ! Peck the fucking grain ! I 'm pecking the fucking grain . I 'm pecking the fucking grain ! 
Susie , this has got to stop . Come on . 
Stay out of it . 
Come and eat this fucking worm ! Come and eat the worm ! 
Come and eat the worm , you fucking chicken ! 
Tommy ! That 's enough ! 
Hey , fuck off ! 
Don 't you interfere ! Otherwise , it goes back up to eight million ! 
Can we just film this so we can wrap this up ? 
He 's gotta attain the frequency first . 
I need him to become a chicken . 
You fucker ! 
Come on ! Be a fucking chicken ! 
I c ... I need to go to the toilet . 
Go on , fuck off ! 
Hurry up ! 
Hey , Tommy . Who 's the chicken now ? 
- Freddy ! 
- Fuck off ! 
â  ª I shot him in the head Because he was a cock â  ª â  ª Ee-i-ee-i-o â  ª â  ª Well , there 's a bang , bang here And a bang , bang there â  ª â  ª Here a dead , there a dead Everywhere a dead guy 's brains â  ª â  ª I just shot a guy in the head â  ª â  ª Ee-i-ee-i-o ! â  ª â  ª Old MacDonald had a farm Ee-i-ee-i-o â  ª â  ª And on this farm , he had some chicks Ee-i-ee-i-o â  ª â  ª A chick , chick here A chick , chick there â  ª
