Dorset Hall was bought by the fourth Lord Bassington in 1802 for the princely sum of £ 3,000 . 
The eighth Lord Bassington still resides here . It 's only with his kind permission that we 're able to visit today . 
So ... follow me . 
The house is famed for its extensive collection of antiquities , which led Lord Byron to quip that it made the British Museum look like a knickknack shop . 
Highlights include the priceless collection of ivory chess pieces that date back to the Byzantine era , an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus , and ... And the , uh , sacred headdress of the Aboriginal tribe known as the Waka Waka . 
Clear off ! 
I 'll have no lizards in my house ! 
You hear me ? 
No fucking lizards ... 
You know what it is , James ? 
I 'm angry . I 'll tell you what really champs my giblets . 
I should be an asset to them . They should want me around . I 'm smart . 
I 'm a smart guy . I 've got grades . It 's ... It blows my mind , man . 
I screw up one time ... maybe a couple , two , three times , all of a sudden , I 'm persona non gratis , not wanted , en voyage . 
It 's ... it 's insane . 
- It 's ridiculous , is what it is , James . - Freddy ? 
Just chill out , man . 
Maybe I don 't wanna chill out , James . 
Maybe ... maybe I need to get out of here . What do you say ? You and me . 
I can 't , bruv . I 've gotta meet someone . 
Or more like something . Something special . 
You know what ? 
- Oh , whoa ! What are you doing ? Freddy ! - I 'm staying right here . 
Freddy ! As part of a general push to increase productivity , we 've decided to expand our operation on your estate . 
The new weed farm would be underground , but we 'd be using the stables for access and somewhere to keep the gennies . 
No , Susie . It 's not happening . 
We agreed to move out on the proviso that you 'd help us make more money . So while we await a detailed breakdown of your new business plan , I am simply cracking on . 
Do it somewhere else . Do it on one of your many other holdings . 
What I do with other properties in my portfolio isn 't something you should worry about . 
What I 'm worried about is the fact that we agreed a timeline for your exit , and now you 're talking about expanding your operation on my estate . 
Freddy 's gone fishing . Great . Stay in touch . 
Not the stables , darling . 
They 're of significant historical importance . 
Mother , Anne Boleyn didn 't change her horses there on her way to visit Henry VIII . 
By the time they were built , she 'd been a headless corpse for 300 years . 
- Well , they may have been updated . - It doesn 't matter . 
I 'm not gonna let them expand their operation on the grounds . 
Would you like me to have a word with Susie Glass ? 
You know I can be quite persuasive when I need to be . 
No , Mother . I don 't want you getting involved with these people . 
I 've seen the effect it 's had on Freddy . 
Yes , and the sooner you get rid of them , the better . 
I just need to figure out a way of making them more money with a little less fuss . 
Now , come on . 
Nothing like a good funeral to put things in perspective . 
In my Father 's house are many rooms . 
If it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . 
What 's with the window ? 
Oh , it was in his will . 
Apparently , he wanted to be buried standing up , sticking out of the ground , so he could have a view of the house . 
Well , that 's unpleasant . 
Oh , that 's the son there , Max . 
He was one of Freddy 's acting chums from Durham . 
If you think you 've seen him before , he did an advert for shampoo that was everywhere . 
He 's going to inherit the entire estate ? Yes . 
The house , the debts , the financial burden . 
You two have a lot in common in that respect . 
Hello , Rosie . 
How 's your tummy ? - My tummy 's fine . Thank you for asking . - You ought to be more careful . 
I might not be around to help you next time . 
Hopefully , there won 't be a next time . 
How 's your American friend ? 
You 're not jealous , are you ? 
A little protective , perhaps . 
Well , that 's very sweet of you . - But I can look after myself . - Oh , I 'm sure you can . 
But I 'd be wary of Mr. Johnston . 
Behind the air of pomposity , there 's a man you don 't wanna fuck with . 
Speak for yourself , Eddie . 
How well do you know the son ? 
He 's rather lovely . He 's your classic struggling artist . Just a little too desperate to be discovered . 
Ever since his father died , he 's been like a bird with a broken wing . 
Would you introduce me ? 
You 're up to something , Eddie . 
Never . 
I remember Freddy . The year above me at Durham . 
He was a bloody good Demetrius . 
Midsummer Night 's Dream . I was Lysander . He should have stuck at it . Seriously , he could 've walked into RADA . 
Oh , Freddy has many talents , but sticking isn 't one of them . 
I heard you 've been getting a lot of work . 
Oh , I can 't complain . 
Acting is like any great art form . It 's the paradoxical reconciliation of our dualistic identities to recognize ironic beauty concealed within the malign . 
Though there 's easier ways of making a living , God knows . 
Max , darling , you have my sympathies . Now I must go and rescue my mother . 
I wanted to offer my condolences . I recently lost my own father . 
- A right kick in the balls , isn 't it ? - Certainly . 
Then add to that the inheritance tax , which is ludicrous . 
When I found out the running costs , I thought they were fucking joking . 
Could 've been the same for me . Fortunately , my father made ... certain provisions . 
You know , uh , it may be worth you and I sitting down , actually . 
There 's a small business opportunity that ... might be of help to you . 
Supply a product that is highly profitable , totally unregulated , inherently benign , and incredibly popular . 
I 'm warming to this , Eddie . I really am . 
It 's the kind of risk-reward relationship I could get on board with . 
Free market , fucking great . Lack of regulation , check . No taxation ? Yeah , baby . 
Smidge of illegality ? Yeah , well , no business plan 's perfect . 
There is , however , one tiny little reputational obstacle that we need to navigate before we could proceed , and it 's ... it 's slightly delicate . 
Well , I can be extremely discreet if necessary . 
You must remember , your father and mine , they used to fish for salmon on the Spey . 
That 's right . And that matters , particularly as it 's my father who 's the cause of this specific challenge . 
I have in my possession a series of documents detailing the purchase of a particularly salacious artifact . 
If these documents were ever to come to light , they would cause considerable scandal . 
In return for £ 500,000 , I will hand them over to you . 
If not , I will be forced to pass them on to the nation 's press . 
Do not make the mistake of underestimating me . 
Can 't you just ignore it ? 
Your father clearly had some demons . Whatever he did dies with him . 
I 'm about to have a second audition for a role in a major Hollywood movie . 
But , as you can see , any kind of hoo-ha is gonna seriously torpedo my chances . 
You 've clearly got some ... connections , and I imagine they would come replete with the necessary skill set to deal with this situation . 
Here 's how I see it going . 
You make contact with the blackmailer . You bring them , and whatever evidence they have , back here , I 'll take a look , make sure it 's the real deal , destroy it , and then ... you can help me convince them never to darken my door again . 
There is , um , one more thing I would , uh , just ask , Eddie . 
When you lay your hands on the file , I 'd really appreciate it if you didn 't look inside . 
Whatever secrets my father had , I 'd appreciate it if they stayed secret . 
A matter of respect for the deceased . 
Whatever is in the file is none of my concern . 
Your father 's secrets will remain secret . You have my word . 
But let 's be clear . If I do this for you , then we have an agreement . 
If you can make this problem go away , you and your criminal associates can turn this place into the Hanging Gardens of the Original Rude Boy Ganja Man for all I care . 
I , um ... I ... I thought you might like some refreshment . 
That 's very kind , Your Grace . 
- Two sugars , if memory serves ? - Absolutely . 
You seem to have worked wonders with that dog . 
She 's a wonderful dog . Pleasure to have around . 
I 'm sure Eddie 's very appreciative . 
It 's not like he hasn 't got enough to contend with right now . 
I wonder if we could be of some assistance to him . 
Come on , Geoff . What have you got up your sleeve ? 
What if we could find an alternative venue for their activities ? 
I 'm sure you 've been acquainted with Mr. Rokes from Green River Farm next door . 
The sheep farmer ? What are you saying ? 
Well , sheep need a lot of land to graze . And lamb 's not turning a profit these days . 
He 's broke ? 
Mr. Rokes is being investigated for fraud by the Ministry of Agriculture . 
So he 's not just broke . 
He 's as bent as a barbed wire fence . 
There 's a sheep auction today , and I 'm pretty sure Mr. Rokes will be in attendance . 
You sly old fox . 
Plants are actually a lot more like humans than people tend to think . 
They breathe . They 're territorial . They communicate with each other . 
How come you know so much about plants ? 
It 's what I do , I guess . 
- I 'm like a botanist . - Oh , no way . 
My granddad used to run a nursery . 
Flowers , not kids . 
I like flowers . 
I 'd love to see your plants one day . 
That 's a bit of a tricky one . 
Where I work is sort of like a ... restricted access area sort of thing . 
I trust you . It 's just ... recently we ... we 've been having a bit of trouble at work . 
Some of our plants went missing . 
Oddly enough , it was on the day that we met . What ? You don 't think I had anything to do with that , do you ? 
Oh , no , course not . 
I mean , what am I gonna steal a load of plants for ? 
Traditionally , the selection process for a prospective new landlord takes place over a couple of months . 
We like to give their bums a good old sniff . We don 't just rock up at funerals waving our check books around . 
Look , it was a business opportunity that was presented to me . And now I 'm presenting it to you . 
This gives you an alternate venue , an increased capacity , and replaces the existing operation on my estate by the end of the year . 
I 'm willing to consider expanding the operation to a 12th location , but when you start talking about a bit of blackmail , then it 's all starting to sound deeply problematic . 
It 's a loose end that I intend to tie up . Very simply , very easily . 
I 'm willing to take a face-to-face meeting , but I 'm not making any promises , and I don 't want any shenanigans . 
No shenanigans . 
Who are you ? 
Don 't turn around . All right . All right . 
- I 'm the guy with the money . - Put the bag on the floor . 
That 's not how this is gonna work . 
I 'm the one who says how this is gonna work . Otherwise , your mate 's face is gonna be on the cover of every newspaper tomorrow morning . 
The only way you 're gonna get your money is if you do exactly as I ... say . 
You 're Frank ? 
Come on , give me the documents , then . 
I get it . You want the documents . Yes . 
Well , I don 't have the documents here . 
Shall we go get them then ? Please . 
A 12 , a 20 , two 53s , and a 69 . 
I like to think of myself as a fairly patient man , Frank . But when you start ordering chicken bao buns ... 
Let me translate . Twelve is vegetable spring rolls . Twenty is confit of pork . Fifty-three is crispy noodle chips , which I 've ordered twice ' cause I 'm quite partial to . 
And 69 you 'll find isn 't on the menu . For the simple reason that 69 isn 't a dish . 
What is it , then ? 
It 's not a " what . " It 's a " who . " 
And here he is . 
- All right , all right . - It 's all there , every penny . Whoa ! Frank , why don 't you explain to the nice man this isn 't his money ? 
The money in that bag is owed to me . And what 's owed to me belongs to you . 
- Sorry . - Fucker ... 
- Hello , Susie . - Just checking in to see how you 're doing . 
Well , it 's not going exactly to plan . 
So you gave him half a mil , now you 've got nothing to show for it ? 
Sounds a bit sloppy , if you don 't mind me saying . 
What 's the name of the guy that lent him the money ? 
I don 't know . He 's a large Chinese gentleman . 
She wants to talk to you . 
Can I help you ? Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . Oh , I see . Yeah . 
Yeah . All right . 
When you put it like that , it does have a bearing on the situation . 
With the greatest respect , Susie , that money 's a longstanding debt that needs to be repaid . 
- For fuck 's sake . - That 's very decent of you . 
If you can guarantee my money , I 'll give your man the address . 
Tell your father I 'll send him some buns . 
You should 've mentioned Susie Glass . She said she 'll meet you there . 
Hello , Susan . 
Compliments of the chef . 
Enjoying your little sojourn into the murky world of criminality ? 
It 's certainly edifying . 
- Shall we ? - Let 's . 
You 're not the taxi . 
No , we were ... We 're looking for your dad . 
Is he around ? He 's busy packing . 
That 's all right , darling . This won 't take long . 
Hello , Francis . You going somewhere ? 
How did you find me ? 
Oh , that would be down to your helpful Chinese friend . 
Now , weren 't you supposed to give us something before you go ? 
If you can find it amongst all these bags . 
Your dad 's a bit of a messy pup , isn 't he ? 
Yeah , Daddy 's a bit of a mess , isn 't he ? That 's what Mummy 's always saying . 
But you 'd be surprised what nutrition can be found in other people 's stools . 
See that one there ? That 's a former cabinet minister . Collects illegally smuggled birds ' eggs . 
This one is a certain children 's TV presenter . Got himself a taste for , uh ... 
You like the breakfast show , don 't you , darling ? 
Daddy used to be one of the top journalists in the country . Then the oligarchs took over . 
Yes , no freedom of the press anymore . You have to answer to the powers that be . 
And if you don 't follow their narrative , they bury you . But not me . My daddy 's got integrity . 
Oh yeah . Big plastic bags full of it . 
Tell you what , darling , why don 't you tell Mummy to make a cup of tea ? 
We don 't wanna be late for our flight . 
Oh , no , don 't you worry . We 've got loads of time . Go on . 
- Sit down , Frank . - Whoa , steady . 
We don 't wanna hurt you or your family . But we want the file . 
Here , that 's it . 
- This better be it . - Aren 't you gonna have a look ? 
See , that 's just it , isn 't it ? No one wants to look inside the folder . 
That 's why the world 's gone to hell . 
I 'm not gonna look because , firstly , it 's of no interest to me . And , secondly , you 're coming with us . 
No one said anything about going anywhere . 
You really not gonna open it ? 
- Not even a little bit curious ? 
Let 's get this done and get Max on board . 
Fair enough . 
One-ten , 11 , dot . Twelve . I 'm bid 13 , bid 14 . £ 15 I 'm bid . 16 . 
Ninety , you . Ninety , you . £ 100 bid . Yeah , there he is . 
Standing up , front row , the guy to the left . 
What do you think 's my best approach ? 
I mean ... I can hardly walk up to the man and ask him if he 'd like to house a cannabis farm under one of his barns . 
I know his estate manager . I could always introduce you . 
But , in my opinion , I think it 's better if you go up and meet him yourself . 
I mean , he 'll know who you are . I 'm sure he 'd be susceptible to your powers of ... persuasion , ma 'am . 
You really think so , Geoff ? 
Well , we know he needs the money . 
And you are very good with people , if you don 't mind me saying so . 
Right , then . Wish me luck . 
Good luck . 
Do you need a hand ? 
I 'm fine , Geoff . 
You know you shouldn 't smoke fish with pine , don 't you ? 
Huh ? You 're planning on smoking that beautiful carp , but the resin , it poisons the flesh . 
I can 't do anything right , can I ? 
I mean , Eddie 's off gallivanting around the country pretending to be a gangster . 
And I 'm stuck here , alone , with this ... dead fish . 
It 's a lucky man who 's happy with his place in life . 
It 's like a secret garden . I know , right ? 
That 's how I like to see it . 
It 's like an underground world filled with magical plants that bring nothing but righteousness and can help everyone feel so much better . 
And it 's all being outlawed by Babylon . 
How many plants you got down here ? 
Rather not get into those details , to be honest . 
It 's a bit ... a bit sensitive information . 
You worried I 'm gonna report you ? 
No , of course not . 
It 's just I like to take my professional responsibilities very seriously . 
Me too . 
Oh , snap . What kind of work do you do ? 
I 'm a consultant . 
People bring me in when they 've got a problem , and I help them fix it . 
A jack of all trades but a master of none is oftentimes better than a master of one . 
Wow . You 're so clever . 
D 'you wanna smoke a joint or something ? 
I 've got loads of different flavors and strains . 
Uh , I don 't smoke . 
- I don 't mind if you do though . - Maybe I 'll just have a cheeky little one . 
I 'm sure there 's one in the ashtray . 
- Just give me two secs . - Okay . Be right back . 
You reckon the world would be a better place if everyone smoked weed ? 
Not necessarily . 
But it 'd definitely make it a lot more calmer . 
You 're gonna need a lot more than this if you 're gonna change the world . Oh , no . 
This spot , it 's just one of 12 . 
Each one as big as this ? 
There 's ones even bigger . 
That 's a pretty substantial network . 
Sure you don 't want a toke ? 
Well , since I 'm with the king of green , why not ? 
Look at this . 
I can 't believe I 'm letting him off for half a mil . 
Don 't get greedy . 
We hand over the documents . You get the money . Then you pay back your friend . 
How fitting that you arrive at night . 
Really , Edward , your sense of timing is wonderfully theatrical . 
We thought you 'd be keen to clean this mess up as soon as possible . 
Quite right . Quite right . 
This is my , uh , associate , Susan Glass . 
Thrilled to meet you , Ms. Glass . 
- Eddie 's told me all about you . - Hmm . Has he now ? 
Let me conclude this rather sordid little business , then , so we can get into the weeds and start hashing out a deal . 
That for me ? 
It 's all there . Photographs , files , documents , the lot . 
You didn 't look inside ? 
No , I didn 't . 
Good man . Good man . 
Now , I 'm well aware you could have some additional backup squirreled away somewhere . That 's why I wanted to have this little chat . 
This is the last you 'll see of me . You have my word . Trouble is , your word 's absolutely meaningless . 
Frank , I think you understand the gravity of the situation . 
You 're not to be heard from again , and if that 's understood , the money is yours . As promised . 
Just because you 've got some muscle now doesn 't change what you really are . 
And what was in that envelope is as compromising as it gets for you and your career . 
Whatever his father was doing , it 's over now . 
What are you talking about his father for ? I wasn 't blackmailing his father . I was blackmailing that mad cunt . 
Well ... that 's somewhat of a revelation , Maxie . 
There 's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this , and it is nothing that will upset anyone unless they are ... unbelievably oversensitive . 
Hold your horses , cowboy . 
I think you need to adjust your transparency settings . 
You need to tell us what is going on right now . 
It 's nothing . It 's a little quirk . It 's a hobby . 
Right ... now . 
If full transparency will help grease the wheels of industry , then , um follow me . 
What do you make of them ? 
They seem , uh , unremarkable . 
Take a closer look . 
Adolf Hitler . 
His use of light is second to none . 
If it wasn 't for the war , he 'd be remembered with the likes of Monet . 
And I 'm in possession of the largest collection of his work outside of Switzerland . 
He was a visionary . 
These painting are average , at best . Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluded . 
I thought a man of your unique lineage might be able to appreciate the work of a true master . 
See beyond the reputation of the man to find the sublime in the malign . 
Your Lordship , maybe you could show them the crown jewels . 
Maybe you 're right . 
After an injury at the Battle of the Somme , Adolf Hitler was examined by an army doctor . 
The records show that he lost a very particular part of his anatomy . 
When it came up for sale five years ago , I made sure nothing stood in my way . 
The sole physical remnant of the Führer of the Third Reich . Preserved in formaldehyde for nearly 80 years . 
Adolf Hitler 's nutball . 
You 've got to be fucking kidding me . 
Had he not lost his right testicle , the balance between logic and creativity would have been held in check , and the world blessed with the next da Vinci . 
Instead , what was sweet turned sour , but no less creative . He still remained a brand genius . 
Think of the theater , the pageantry of the Third Reich . 
The Hugo Boss uniforms , the aesthetic construction of the Luger , the dynamic lines of the Messerschmitt . The ironic , iconic symbolism of the majestic eagle resting upon the ancient Indian symbol for peace . 
And just as the acorn retains the potential of the fully grown oak , I am now in possession of the genesis of Hitler 's creative genius . In his teste . 
I 'm not sure this is gonna work , Max . Susie , we 're done here . 
Come on , Eddie , don 't be a wuss . 
Let 's not be too hasty , Edward . 
I don 't care about his ideological or his philosophical positions . 
I came to explore a possible business venture , and whatever 's floating around in that jar is gonna have an impact on our negotiations . 
Now , this is what 's called leverage , Eddie . 
We have a special rate for people like him . 
- What do you mean , people like me ? 
- Max ! Can 't let you do that , Frank . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! 
Everyone , just calm down . 
I 'm not gonna let anything jeopardize my career . 
You have no fucking idea how hard I 've had to work to get into this position . 
I 'm gonna be a fucking star ! 
Got one body in the house that needs disposing of and one somewhat unsympathetic gentleman who requires your attention . 
What happened , boss ? 
After a rather bizarre revelation ... Nutball . 
... negotiations took an unexpected turn . There were some minor disagreements about the deal structure . 
But Eddie here proved himself remarkably capable at arbitration . 
After the inevitable to-ing and fro-ing , we managed to iron out terms that were acceptable to all parties . 
What do you want us to do ? 
Impress upon Lord Fuckhead the details of our contract . 
Unless you have any objections , Your Grace ? I know he was a family friend . - No . 
Do your worst . - What about him ? 
- He 'll be all right . - Yeah . 
Come on , then . 
My goodness , Edward . You simply reek of formaldehyde . 
Where on earth have you been ? 
And why are you drinking whiskey first thing in the morning ? 
The less said about that , the better . But , suffice to say , it 's been , uh ... ... a rather long night . Oh . 
Well , whilst you 've been gadding about doing God knows what , I have been finding solutions to our current predicament . 
Right . 
I 've found a new home for your marijuana plantation . 
What ? 
It 's Mr. Rokes , darling . 
From next door . 
He 's sitting on 2,000 acres that he can 't afford to keep , and he is longing to talk to someone about a long-term lease . 
Well , well . 
You would not believe the things I 've done in the last 48 hours , Mother . And you come along and ... fix it all with a glass of sherry . 
I 've got a lot of time for your mum . Takes good care of herself . Good sense of humor . A little bit eccentric , but who isn 't ? 
Just a little . So are you gonna talk to my neighbor , then ? 
I 'll take the meeting . See if it 's appropriate . At least someone did their due diligence . 
Despite the , uh , few minor niggles we might 've come across in the last couple of days , you actually came out on top . 
I don 't appreciate being shot at , Edward . 
In fact , and this may come as a shock to you , given my chosen career path , I actually make a point of avoiding being shot at , at all times . 
Having said that , I will admit you proved yourself useful in the end . 
Oi , oi , love birds . 
Don 't mind me . 
Hello , mate . 
I 've gotta get this straight , ' cause Blanket was making no sense . 
According to him , you had a spin on master chef over there and blew up a load of Nazis . With a fucking grenade . 
Nazi . Singular . Now we have a rare art collection and two farms to set up . 
I take it all back . 
Suze , he 's a proper G. 
You 're a fucking idiot , Jack . 
To Eddie , the grand duke of getting shit done . 
Hmm , no , no , no . I 'm not cheersing to that . 
All right . Why don 't we cheers to looking in the envelope ? 
To looking in the envelope . Whatever the fuck that means .
