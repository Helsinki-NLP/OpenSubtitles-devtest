The cultivation process of a marijuana plant takes a minimum of three months , depending on the strain . 
And once it 's dried and cured , I pack it up ... ship it out to our distributors . 
But first , I need to perform a ceremonial sampling of the product . This is to ensure optimum customer satisfaction . 
Better get rolling , then . 
Safe deliveries , Jimmy . 
Adios . 
Good morning . What can I get you ? Hi . Yeah . 
Can I get a egg and bacon pancake stack , please ? Some cheesy rings . Can I get a banana milkshake with that ? 
Coming right up . 
Ah , so sorry , can I get some of that special sauce to go with it , please ? 
The special sauce is on the table . You just help yourself . 
Can 't have cheesy rings without special sauce . Thanks . 
Some people say it 's just ketchup and mayo . They don 't know what they 're talking about . 
That 's just a thousand islands dressing , innit ? 
Exactly . They 're forgetting the secret ingredient . 
I thought it was lemon juice , but now I 'm not so sure . 
I was always working on the assumption that it was horseradish . 
Horseradish ? 
Interesting . 
Don 't tell me you 're about to put that on your egg and bacon pancake stack . 
Ah , I know it sounds so wrong . But I promise you , it tastes so right . 
- I thought I was the only one . - What ? 
You 're kidding ? 
I just had a whole plateful now . I 'm about to finish off my cheesy rings . 
Ah , you see , I eat my cheesy rings first , ' cause , you know , you gotta eat them while they 're hot . 
Nah , I prefer them close to room temperature . 
You know what ? 
I 'mma put one aside , let it cool down . See if you 're right . 
I 'm Gabrielle , by the way . 
Jimmy . 
Oh my God . I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . It was an accident . 
- Let me get you another drink . - It 's cool . 
- Don 't worry about that . - No , honestly , I want to . - It 's the least I can do . - Are you sure ? 
Yeah . Vanilla milkshake ? 
Oh , it was banana , actually . 
That 's my fave flavor too . 
Uh , can I get a banana milkshake ? 
This way , you can get hold of me . 
I mean , if you ever wanna spill anyone 's milkshake again . 
Thanks , Jimmy . 
It was nice meeting you . 
Want a fight ? 
I 'm fucking with you , mate . Joking . 
Unless you want one ? 
You army boys love a ruck , don 't ya ? 
I 'm looking for your sister . 
Business or pleasure ? Strictly business . 
Better be . 
Just fucking with ya . 
Watch yourself . She 's got the right hump . You might be better off in here . 
You can 't find Jimmy ? 
Knock on his door , bang on his window , rattle his fucking letterbox . 
Might 've got so stoned he forgot what day of the week it was . 
Don 't worry about the Albanians . I 've got ' em under manners . 
Steady Eddie . Yeah , he 's here with me now . 
You focus on finding Jimmy , all right ? 
Call me when you get there . 
Morning , Susie . 
Jimmy 's not answering his phone . So we 're currently in the midst of exploring a number of scenarios . 
I 'm afraid I couldn 't find him either . Neither could any of my staff and , despite spending an inordinate amount of time together , neither could Freddy . 
Our investigation 's already moved away from your estate . 
Right . Well , then , why am I here ? 
Well , as you might imagine , the customer expecting the shipment was somewhat disappointed . 
Where 's my weed at ? 
Presumably you explained there was some unforeseen delay there ? 
We 've been doing business with Toni Blair for years , but he 's not exactly nuanced . 
Where 's my weed at ? 
Unforeseen delay . 
- Hold on . Tony Blair ? 
- He 's a Kosovan-Albanian . Tony Blair was like a savior to those guys back in the day . 
It 's a very popular name . 
- He 's a bit of a mug . - Yeah . - But he 's good for money . - Where 's my weed at ? 
Can 't you just give his money back ? 
You never give back money once it 's been handed over . 
And the reason for that being ? 
It 's just something you don 't do . 
Well , you 'll just have to tell him to be patient , then . 
It might be a little late this month . 
Yeah , but you 've forgotten how this works . Where 's my weed at ? 
You try , but life 's too short . 
Given that it would be deeply problematic if people started to think your supply chain couldn 't be relied upon , you decide to throw him a bone . See if there 's something you can do to make up for the inconvenience . 
You see that whip ? It 's hotter than a jalfrezi . 
Part of a sideline I 've been setting up as an auto trader . 
Import-export . I take in orders from all over . 
We pick up the vehicle and deliver it to the client . Bang ! Good price . Cash in hand . Gezuar . 
The other day , we ran into something , ended up getting our wings clipped . 
Clipped ! 
Which has severely restricted our operational effectiveness . 
Severely . 
So , because his product 's been delayed , you 've promised to steal a car for him ? 
Not just any car . This is a very particular vehicle . 
Lamborghini Huracan . 
- Green . - I know where it 's gonna be . I know when it 's gonna be there . 
All I need is a bit of help with collection and delivery . 
And you agreed to that why ? 
I don 't expect you to appreciate the nuances of the symbiotic ecosystem that allows our business to flourish , but , yes , I did . 
So presumably this is an issue you and your team will sort ? 
My team are currently focusing their attentions on problem A , figuring out what 's happened to the weed . 
That leaves problem B. The stealing of the car . Which is , admittedly , less pressing and , frankly , beneath me . Nonetheless , still needs tackling with a degree of ... finesse . 
And given the terms of our agreement , I thought you might be interested in stepping up . 
Why me ? Why not one of your delightful associates ? 
The request comes from my father . 
His motivation remains enigmatic . 
Well , if I were to do this ... it would be a significant departure from the content and spirit of our agreement . Thus , um , I 'd be looking for something in return . 
You 'd have to be more specific . 
Well , you talked about increased profitability . 
Why don 't we choose a number so we can use it as a floor ? 
You want a number . 
All right . I can give you a number . 
Good . We also discussed you leaving my estate by the end of the year , but it wasn 't made clear whether that was a financial year or a calendar year . 
Perhaps we should just name a date . 
I 'll have to check my diary . 
But sure . 
Then let 's sort your little problem , shall we ? 
Toni Blair said he 'd meet us at the garage . 
Well , let 's rearrange my afternoon , then . 
Don 't know what Dad sees in him . 
Just ' cause he 's a soldier . Don 't mean nothing in the real world . 
No , but he killed someone and didn 't spin out into an existential crisis . 
Most people would wake up in a cold sweat . The duke slept like a baby . 
And how do you know that ? 
Speaking metaphorically . 
Look , truth is , there are 24 dukes in this country . This seems to be the only one who can navigate both the upper echelons of high society and shoot someone in the head without worrying . 
So does that make him useful ? 
In the very specific and unique world in which we operate , it does . 
Truth is , you 're looking at a very tight window . 
This vehicle 's only gonna be in London a couple of days before it gets moved on . 
The place is run by a lady called Mercy . 
She 's made a name for herself in the world of high-end , super-modified luxury vehicles . 
Some of it legal . Some of it not . 
That 's the beauty of it . She 's a secondhand car dealer , so her crew isn 't tasty or anything like that . 
But at the same time , she don 't want the police looking into her business . 
Well , what 's so special about this car , then ? 
They want a Lamborghini Huracan Evo with a tint gloss , green finish , and they 're willing to pay good money . That 's what we get ' em . 
The key to the Lambo is kept in Mercy 's boudoir along with all the other keys . 
That 's the challenging bit . The rest is cream cheese . 
Once you 've got the key , hold it next to this thing . You zap it for 30 seconds , and then ... you 're ready to fuck . 
It 's a two-stage attack , innit . 
Stage one , nick the key when no-one 's looking . Stage two , come back for a little bit of Grand Theft Auto . 
Remind me why I 'm doing this and you 're not . 
We 've gotta be tucked up in bed by six . GPS send tings , man . Come on , fam . 
How are you gonna clone the key with all these people about ? 
I need to create a distraction . 
Thank you . Thank you , bro . 
Seriously , this is ... 
I ... I ... I will not let you down , okay ? 
Because I know that I 've been a little bit of a burden recently . 
No , no , no , don 't say anything . I have been , okay ? 
Which is why it means so much to me that you are giving me this opportunity to pay you back . And I will not fuck it up . - I will do what you say . - Freddy . 
- I will do anything . Literally ... anything . - Freddy . - Freddy . - Mm-hmm ? 
All you need to do is pretend that you wanna buy a car . 
That 's it . It 's just buying a car . That 's all it is . It 's genius . 
W-What 's the thing behind the thing here , Edwina ? 
Freddy , you don 't say anything . - I 'll be acting as your representative . - Yeah . 
I 'll say we want to test drive a vehicle . 
The rest is up to you , Wham Tam . 
No performance , Freddy . I just need a picture . 
Yeah , I get it . No performance , just a picture . I get it . Right . I 'm good . 
Mabuhay ! Welcome ! 
Is there anything I can help you with ? 
Yes , uh , I operate a bespoke concierge service for high-net-worth individuals such as my client . 
We 're looking for a , uh , luxury vehicle . Something that 'll stand out from the pack . 
And my client 's willing to pay in cash for something really special . 
Then why don 't you go to the showrooms in Park Lane ? 
They have plenty of special cars you can buy down there . 
They also have plenty of questions . 
My client values discretion . Do you understand ? No . None of this is going to work for me . 
When we spoke , Gary , I told you I wanted something fast , something powerful , but also smooth and lightweight like Siberian tiger . 
Anatoli Givenchy Romanov . This is my wife , Anastasia . 
My criteria is very specific , okay ? 
When I put the key in the starter engine , I want to hear it roar . 
But you understand that there 's a premium attached to these kind of cars . 
So here is thing , little leopard lady . Fuck money . 
Well , then , you 've come to the right place . 
Every one of these vehicles is unique . 
I don 't know if personal security is a priority for you , but all of them can be refitted with body armor . 
Listen , in my life , funny little lady , if you are not safe , you are dead . 
What about that one ? 
Ah , da . This is a McLaren 650S four-liter V8 . 
Zero to 60 in three seconds . No , I don 't know . This one to me is a little ... puf puf . 
No , I prefer something sexier . 
- What about the Lamborghini ? 
- That car is not for sale , unfortunately . 
Whoa , whoa , you don 't play tickle fuck with me , lady , okay ? 
You give me keys , I drive car . I am serious man . 
That car is owned by someone else . The McLaren is a serious car . 
You should drive it . You 'd like it , trust me . 
You wait . 
What 's with the voice ? 
Keep it up , and I 'll kill you . It 's fine . The little leopard lady , she love me . 
Your wife needs to drive the fucking car . 
Don 't fuck this up , Freddy . 
Go with the orange . 
Fuck it , we go with the orange . I love orange . What the fuck . Let 's do it . 
Just keep them occupied . 
Oh , no , no , no , no , no , my friend . I am modern man . 
- I drive . - She drive . 
The clutch takes getting used to , so go easy on it , okay ? 
Any scratches or dents , you pay . 
You underestimate my wife . 
Holy shit ! 
That ... that one there , that was close . I ... I give you that . 
Jesus ! Fuck . 
Come on , come on ! 
Can I help you ? 
I thought you 'd like to start drawing up the contract . 
The Russian doll is not insured , she 's driving like she 's done three grams of chop chop , and your clients haven 't agreed on a price yet . 
My apologies . 
Let me go and talk to them . 
Okay . So , uh , what do you think , my baby boo-boo ? 
You , uh ... You like ? 
The car is good . I just don 't like the color . 
Maybe you should think about it . 
Very carefully . 
You wouldn 't want to make a mistake . 
We 'll be in touch , thank you . Come on , Gary . 
Oh , you 're up . 
Sit down . 
Drink that . 
Thanks for taking me in , Geoff . 
I 'm not here to lecture ya . 
We 've gotta shake the old snow globe once in a while , don 't we ? 
But the important thing is , you 've gotta learn from the experience . 
Do you understand what I 'm saying ? 
I ... 
Good . 
You all right , Jimmy ? 
That 's a surprisingly difficult question to answer right now , to be honest . 
How you doing ? 
I 'm just proper sorry about the current situation . 
Well , if you 're sorry , that 's all right , then . 
Except , now , hang on a minute ... Where the fuck have you been ? 
It 's a bit of a long story , actually . Yeah ? Let 's go straight to the end , then . Where the fuck is my weed ? 
Probably best if I start from the beginning . 
I was driving down the road , but then I got the munchies , innit . So I pulled over to get some provisions at my usual spot , Patty 's . 
- And then it happened . - What happened , Jimmy ? 
To be honest , my life 's not been the same since . 
It was like a whatchamacallit ? 
One of those ' piphany things . 
An apparition . Well , most people call it a girl , innit . But me , I call it an angel . 
It 's just , she didn 't have no wings . 
Well , none I could see , anyway . 
And then , just like that , she reached out and snatched it . 
What did she snatch , Jimmy ? 
It was ... it was either my heart or my soul . Or even both . 
It 's been like a kaleidoscope of dominoes on the tumble . 
Then my day went from mad to bad . 
First the van full of business , it went poof . 
Gone ! Evaporated like ... like steam from a kettle . 
A rabbit out of a hat in reverse . 
Then my phone ran out of juice . Then I couldn 't get no pees . So I stuck my thumb out , Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . 
Magic number 42 . 
Then the universe started throwing mad mud at me . 
Pedi priests . 
Not touching my acorn . 
That 's not my kind of thing . 
Go play with your own quail 's egg in your bushy crow 's nest . 
Fuck off , noncey cunts . 
Then Jimmy Chang hit the jackpot . 
At least , that 's what I thought . 
God , for the second time in a day , extends his righteous hand . 
A van full of headbangers . Pocket full of shrooms . 
So I have a smoke and a toke , we break bread , feel the love , and then I find myself in the dance . 
Music 's thumping , heart 's pumping , energy 's jumping , but I can 't shake the vision of the angel out of my nut . 
I 'm telling you , she 's in the picture for a reason . 
So I have a cup of tea to pull myself together . That 's when the shrooms kick in . 
After that , it felt like I fell off a cliff . 
To be honest , it 's like ... It 's all a bit of a haze . Like a purple haze . 
Next thing you know , I 'm face down in Adam 's clay , getting a poke from behind by Mr. Geoff and his stick of judgement . 
Tell me about the girl . Oh , Gabrielle . 
Oh , she 's like a dream come true . 
We had this weird connection . 
She was a bit indescribable , to be honest . 
And the keys to the van were on the table when you sat down ? 
Yeah . I 'm sure it was . 
And they weren 't there afterwards ? Wait . Y-You don 't think ... 
Nah , sh-she wouldn 't do that to me . We were proper vibing . 
How the hell are we gonna find her ? Find her ? Oh no , you don 't need to worry about that . I gave her my number , innit . 
So when she calls me , I-I 'll just ask her about the keys . 
Oh my God . 
I mean , I 've just got this feeling . 
Like ... you just know sometimes . 
You know ? 
Go back to the service station . Talk to the staff . 
Cool . 
Sorry , boss . I 'm so sorry . Is there anything I can do to help ? 
Yeah . Find a way to make those plants grow faster . ' Cause we 've got a big hole in our production line now . And if that weed doesn 't turn up , you 're wearing it . 
Wait here . 
Captain ? 
The state of him . He can barely keep his eyes open . 
So , Eddie , you want to place a further burden upon my shoulders . 
Well , I 'm sorry if it 's an inconvenience for you , but when we discussed me collecting a vehicle for you , I wasn 't expecting to encounter severed human body parts . 
- What human body parts ? - Finger . 
- Single or plural ? 
- Single . 
- Thumb or index ? - Little . 
It may be the smallest finger on the human hand , but the fact that it 's been hacked off suggests a significant escalation in terms of the people we 're dealing with . 
You 're not getting a case of the collywobbles ? No . I 'm merely making you aware of the situation . 
Running it up the chain of command , as it were . 
As it were . 
Now , I 'm not suggesting you 've been lied to , but it 's safe to say the information you 've been given was incomplete . 
But now you have a lead on your weed , I was wondering if there was a scenario where I don 't have to steal a car for you . 
We have a name . That 's more than likely a fake name . 
And the only description we have is from a witness who 's dosed up to the gills on psilocybin . 
But more importantly , my dad 's asked . 
He 's got his reasons . He will reciprocate . 
So , yes , I still need you to steal the car . 
- Might I have a quick word , please ? - Yes , Your Grace . 
Everything okay ? 
Well , I was ... rather hoping you might tell me . 
An associate of the duke 's got lost in the woods . I was dropping him off . 
How lucky we are to have you watching over us . 
It 's a pleasure and a privilege to be of service . 
It is a great comfort knowing that we have your continued discretion with all the ... goings-on around the house . 
You can be in no doubt of the steadfastness of my loyalty towards you and your family . 
It is absolute . 
Geoff , you would tell me if you ever thought that Eddie were ever going to get in any real trouble ? 
I 'll keep my ear to the ground . 
Stealth mode , huh ? 
That 's awesome . 
Uh , were you expecting anyone to be inside ? 
Not exactly , no . 
Then I think I 'm gonna stick around for a bit . - In case there 's any problems . - No , Freddy . You go straight home . 
Sure . Yeah . 
Definitely . 
I 'll go straight home . 
Only I think you need to tread a bit fucking carefully with these people . 
I 'll be all right , Fredward . 
Look , um ... 
- Can I ask you a question , please ? 
Why the fuck are we doing any of this ? 
We could do what dad did . Five million a year for absolutely nothing . 
- It 's a pretty good payday . - It 's not about the money . 
It 's about removing ourselves from a criminal organization . 
It 's about taking back control . 
Control . So just so I 've got this clear in my mind . In order to stop ourselves being associated with criminals , we are going to become ... criminals . We 're not criminals , Freddy . 
Sure . 
I 'll see you at home . 
Good luck . 
Fuck are you doing ? 
Cool . Commando roll . 
I tell you anything you want to know , but please , don 't hurt me again . 
That 's not good . 
Very , very sorry , but I won 't do it again . 
No more fingers , please . 
Please , you must get me out of here . 
- For fuck 's sake . 
- Please ! 
- Please don 't leave me ! - Sh ! 
Oh , that 's really not good . 
Thank you . Thank you . I owe you my life . 
It 's fine . 
Yeah , what ? 
Edward , you need to get the fuck out of there now , okay ? Abort . The eagle has landed . The fox is in the henhouse ... 
I told you to go fucking home ! 
Listen to me . Get out of here . I 'm not going fucking anywhere . 
- Please take me home . - Hold on . 
Come on , you vintage cunt ! 
Is it safe now ? 
Best keep your head down for a little longer . 
Freddy , call me back . I wanna make sure you got out of there okay . 
Could you please untie me now ? 
You all right ? 
Come here , come here . 
Here . 
You all right ? 
Oh , man , you saved my life . 
Look what she did to me . - Vizh . - Jesus . 
I used to play the piano . 
I 'm fucked up . I 'm incomplete . 
Incomplete . 
What did you do to her ? 
You don 't know ? 
No , of course I bloody don 't . 
What the fuck have you done ? 
You ... you must take back . 
Ne , ne , ne , ne . You must take back . 
- Ne , ne , ne . - Take what back ? 
Open up . Open up the trunk . I show you . 
All right , fine . Fine . 
I take it things didn 't go exactly as planned , then . 
That would be an understatement . 
Want a wet wipe ? 
Maybe freshen yourself up while you tell me what happened . 
Well , turns out Toni Blair wasn 't exactly honest about why he wanted that car . 
How so ? 
One hundred and fifty kilos of super premium uncut cocaine . 
In the whole car . 
Must be worth three mil , at least . 
Three and a half , apparently . 
Well , maybe Toni Blair didn 't know it was there . 
He knew ! He set the whole thing up . He sent me in , like he sent you in . 
- Hang on . Who 's this ? - The guy with the missing finger . 
Ah . Where 'd you find the rest of him ? 
In the warehouse , tied to a chair . 
When you 're on a job , you never answer a cry for help . 
It 's a fucking cliché . That 's the worm that covers the hook . What are you ? First mouse that gets the cheese ? 
This is not my day job , Susie . 
So he 's saying Toni Blair knew about the gear . 
He knew the fucking car was full of coke , and he knew what would happen . 
You should walk away , man . That 's what I 'm gonna do . 
Chop chop people . Bad people . Nasty people . Drown ... Wait , wait ! 
Not anymore , he 's not . 
That 's why we don 't get involved in the chop game . 
Let me give you a hand . 
It 's easier to move , and the numbers are bigger , but it attracts all sorts of flotsam and jetsam . 
To be clear , the only reason we 're in the chop game is because you asked me to steal this fucking car . 
I 'm aware of the circumstances that have led to our predicament , Edward . 
I 'm interested in exploring how we can extract ourselves from it . 
I take it you 've still got the gear . 
Yeah , it 's in the boot of the car , parked outside . 
Well , I know plenty of people who 'd take the gear off us , but they 'd ask questions . 
So what do we do ? We dump the gear , put the car in the sink , forget it ever happened ? First , we find out who the gear belongs to . 
Freddy can 't come to the phone right now . You wanna know why ? 
Because he 's preparing for his punishment . 
Bring me the cocaine . 
Change of plan . 
I 've done some ringing around . Turns out this Mercy lady 's got some serious Colombian muscularity behind her . 
I 'd rather stay out of that lane , so this is gonna require some very delicate handling . 
However , I think if we give her what she wants , there 's no reason this can 't be handled amicably . 
It 's gonna be all right , soldier . 
You 'd better have my rice . 
He says he 's your brother . Is this true , or is this more bullshit like the stupid voice he made ? 
He 's my brother . 
Now you have your product , you can let him go . 
You stole from me . 
There have to be consequences . 
They didn 't know what they were stealing . 
And you are ? 
I 'm Susie Glass . 
Compliments to the chef . Certain lanes for certain horses . Certain slips for certain dogs . You know how this works . 
You can 't just return what you stole . 
We have people , organizations , competition . They need to know , cause and effect . I mean , someone 's got to pay . 
We understand . 
That 's why we brought a peace offering . 
As you can tell , we 've been misled . 
Now you put him in the chair instead of my brother . 
I believe in , uh , biblical punishment . Hmm ? Eddie . For the love of fuck , get ... 
Agh , Jesus Christ . 
Eye for an eye . 
If someone tries to steal from you , it 's enough to take off a finger . 
You don 't need to take a finger . You don 't need to take anything else because , technically , I didn 't try to steal anything . 
- Isn 't that right ? - You 're right , Freddy . 
If someone actually steals from you ... Hmm ? I mean , the message needs to be loud and clear . Yeah ? 
- Freddy , we 're done here . Come on . - Stay the fuck there ! 
All right . All right . 
I-It 's not enough for justice to be done . 
Justice needs to be seen to be done . 
As a warning for those who might suffer the temptations in the future . 
If that 's directed at me , I promise you I 'm not gonna be tempted in future . 
I promise you that . 
Okay , you keep your eyes open , and you 'll learn a valuable lesson . 
Let 's hear what he has to say , yeah ? 
Fuck you . You cocksucking bitch ! 
Thank you for your attention . 
It 's a job like any other . 
Sometimes you have your good days ... and you have your not-so-good days . 
Yeah , sometimes you win , sometimes you watch someone get hacked to death with a machete . 
The important thing is that you showed the right attitude . 
- What does that prove ? - Fucking hell . 
It proves you 've got the stomach for it . 
Which is more than can be said for your brother . 
Okay , I 'm done . 
Can we go home now , please , Ed ? 
All right , Jimmy ? 
I had a feeling you was gonna call . 
I mean , I had a bit of negative energy around me . That was due to a few other people . 
Deep down inside , it felt inevitable . 
I was feeling bad about spilling your milkshake . 
Nah , you don 't need to worry about that . You ... you got me a new one anyway . 
Did you get where you were going all right ? Ah , yeah , that . 
It 's a bit of a long , weird , drawn-out story , to be honest . 
Well , maybe we should meet up sometime . You can tell me all about it . 
Yeah , I would like that . I would like that very much . 
Maybe we should go to a similar kind of food establishment and try the dinner menus . 
It 's a date . 
Okay . All right . Brilliant . 
I 'll see you soon , then . 
You actually like him , don 't you ? 
Course not . Don 't be silly . 
He 's agreed to meet her for dinner tomorrow night . 
He 's either Rudolph Valentino or a few fries short of a Happy Meal . 
Shall we light this up ? 
I realized I haven 't been taking things as seriously as I should . 
I need to make changes . Drastic ones . So I 've decided I 'm only gonna smoke weed in the evenings . Not first thing when I wake up in the morning . 
Not when I 'm eating lunch . Or after lunch . Or when I 've had something to eat ... 
We are still a mil and a half down on the weed though . 
Ah yeah . I realized that too . And I 'll endeavor to repay that debt . 
I mean , right now , I 'm working on this new hybrid weed strain , and the THC on that bad boy ... 
You 'd better get back to work , then . 
Yes , boss . 
Hello , darling . 
Well , I must say , he 's coping with it rather well . 
Hmm . Thank you . 
I 'd rather expected him to fall to pieces when confronted with a near-death experience . 
So he told you , then . 
I tried to keep him out of it . 
But you very nearly didn 't . 
You were supposed to be getting rid of these people , not joining them . 
You come play little bit of bang-bang . 
I will get rid of them , Mother . 
See you later . 
All right . 
What are we playing ? Straight down-the-line , or automatic ball trap ? 
Sporting doubles , Your Grace . 
Ms. Tamasina has nine out of ten , and Master Frederick is yet to score .

You did well , Fredward . Very well . 
- Call pull when you 're ready , sir . - Thank you .
