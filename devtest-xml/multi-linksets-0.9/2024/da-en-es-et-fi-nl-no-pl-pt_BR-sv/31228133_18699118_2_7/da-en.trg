Gonna be hard to top NYC . True , but I can 't wait to try a Philly pretzel . I wanna try water ice , of course . I cannot stop thinking about the official Philly cheese steak . 
Ooh , now you 're making me hungry . 
Right ?

Philly is so beautiful . 
You know , this is actually where my grandma and grandpa met , so who knows , maybe this will be the place Teddy pops the big question . Kyra ! Seriously ? Well , our followers love it . 
No . Your followers do . 
Every time you mention getting engaged , I get dragged through the comments . 
" Teddy doesn 't know what he 's got . " " Us waiting not so patiently for Teddy to put a ring on it . " 
" Why is she even with him ? He 's mid . " It 's not funny . 
I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to build something here for both of us . 
I asked you three times . - I looked like an ass that day . 
- No , you looked handsome ! 
It was the only footage I had of us together . 
It 's fine . I 'll take it down .

Hi . 
Provisions . 
Are you insane ? 
It 's pouring ! I 'm good . How are you ? Sorry . 
Are you insane ? 
It 's pouring . 
Very cute . I thought you were meeting up with that guy that confessed to the car bombing . 
Logan barlowe , yeah , the road to frackville is completely flooded , so I had to reschedule . Cheese , crackers , wine ... And candles ? 
Yeah , just whatever I had at the house . 
Whatever you had at the house ? 
I gotta say , I like where you 're going with this . 
Figured you need some things ' cause of the storm . 
So , you ... Threw your ex-wife 's new man a bachelor party . How 'd that go ? 
You don 't have to do that . 
Do what ? Well , just make it weird with your words , you know ? 
My words are making it weird ? - My words ? 
- Yeah , your words . Do you mean my facts ? 
Mike is my partner , and ... We had fun . 
- Yeah . - Great . 
Nikki have fun at hers ? I don 't know . 
Nik ? There 's a body on the bar . I 'm here . 
Looks like a party city threw up in here . 
Yeah , well , you know ... Our , our original plan got washed out . 
You might wanna clean this place up before braun catches wind . 
He gave me his blessing . He even sent up some champagne . 
So he 's playing nice for a change ? 
It 's , good you crashed here , ' cause I barely made it in . 
Well , maybe ... maybe we got a little carried away . 
On a scale of one to " chocolate city , " what 're we talking ? 
I didn 't ask you about your party . 
So it 's like that ? Yeah ! 
Bachelorette parties are sacred . 
- Girl code . - Okay , well , then , that 's fine . I 'm not telling you what me and Jay got into . 
Fine . 
Gross . 
A coffee ? 
Coffee ! Helen ! Wake up ! 
Good morning , sergeant sherman . 
Gosh . 
Hey ... You know we eat off of there , right ? Help ! 
Help ! I need help ! I need to report a missing person . 
Good morning , sunshine . 
Stop . Don 't film me . I don 't have makeup . 
Come on . You 're perfect just the way you are . Thank you . 
So , where do our adventures take us today ? 
You look so happy . How long have you and Kyra been together ? 
Two years . 
We met at a party in college . Spent the night talking about places we wanted to see , movies , music ... I don 't know , life . She 's so easy to talk to . Kyra makes everybody feel special . 
And you two live in a Van ? 
Yeah . 
After we graduated , Kyra had already built this following online , posting videos on YouTube , TikTok , food reviews , travel ... That kind of thing . 
So we decided to renovate the Van and hit the road . 
Never thought I 'd live in a Van , but I would live in a dirt hole if it meant being with her . 
And you got to Philadelphia when ? 
Three days ago . This morning , I went to get her coffee . When I got back , she was gone . 
The Van was gone . 
It just ... It doesn 't make any sense . 
Teddy , is there a chance that Kyra just needed a break ? 
Maybe you two got into a fight ? 
- No . - Are you sure ? 
I mean , it 's tough , living in such close quarters . 
No . We love each other . 
I 'm telling you , something happened to her . 
Does Kyra know anyone in Philly ? Maybe she went to see them ? 
No , and I 've called her a thousand times . She always answers . 
Have you reached out to her parents yet ? 
Her parents passed away junior year . Her mom died of cancer , and then her dad passed away shortly after that . 
Kyra said it was of a broken heart . 
That sounds like a lot . She has this hole in her heart where her parents used to be . 
I think it 's why she tries so hard to build a following online ... To fill that ... need . 
I mean , I tried . 
Teddy , I promise you , my team and I will do everything we can . Okay ? 
You don 't understand . Since her parents died , she hates being alone , captain Batista . 
It terrifies her . So she wouldn 't just take off like this . 
Something bad happened . 
I know it . Why don 't you come with me ? We 'll find you some dry clothes . 
With a storm this bad , I 'm not gonna take any chances . 
I am issuing an alert for Kyra . 
Missing girl . I gotta go . 
It 's a hurricane out there . 
Yeah , I know , but , it 's my job . 
It 's what I do , so I gotta go do it . 
I will be back to check on you later , yeah ? 
God , men are dumb . 
What , you forget your cape , super cop ? 
That 's funny . 
What , you shower with your clothes on ? 
No . I got that alert about that girl , Kyra . 
Yeah , her boyfriend came in this morning and reported her missing . 
Wait . Are you at Wayne 's motel ? 
Very nice . Looks like the party didn 't end when I thought it did . 
No ! No , no . He just stopped by . 
With provisions . 
Provisions . Anyway , can you ... 
Can you come pick me up ? My car is under nine feet of water . That 's impossible . The governor just declared a state of emergency . 
The Delaware river 's flooded over . We 're right next to it . 
The whole building 's on lockdown . 
Well , hold on . What kind of an idiot would put the police headquarters on lockdown ? 
Let me guess . 
Braun ? 
I don 't know . - But it 's crazy out there . - Wherever Kyra is , 
Okay . 
Now what ? 
You okay ? 
Kyra de la Cruz , 22 . Travel influencer . 
Last seen this morning near city center by her boyfriend , Teddy Williams , and I 'm searching traffic cams for their Van , but with this weather , I mean , the visibility is shot . 
Nothing yet from the alert . 
There 's no luck on her phone , either . It 's either off or taken . 
Well , dig into Kyra 's online content . See if there 's any leads on locations , obsessive fans ... Anything . Yep , gotcha . 
Could I help ? 
Helen ? Yes , captain ! Can you , take officer hard body somewhere that isn 't ... here ? 
Yeah . Sure thing . 
Thanks . My real name 's Jack , actually . 
Well , Jackson . " Officer hard body " is just my pretend name . 
- Right . - It 's okay . 
- Even I get confused . - Helen ? 
Sorry . 
Come on , Jack . 
We 'll let you know as soon as the lockdown is lifted . Nice to meet you , Jack . 
He 's kinda nice . I can 't take him serious with that little shirt , all right ? It 's hard to concentrate . Okay . 
Geez . 
- What 's going on ? - Wait a minute , wait a minute . 
Teddy posted on insta asking their followers for help finding Kyra . 
The tips are pouring in . 
This is insane . Get every free body and log them . 
This is great news . Does that go for officer hotpants too ? - What ? 
- You heard me ! Somebody knows something , okay ? 
I want a report in my office in an hour . 
Anybody seen Jay ? 
Yeah , Wayne 's motel . 
That 's great . There 's a girl in trouble , and I 'm stuck in here playing cards . 
Okay . 
You get ... Seven cards . You discard , you pull a card every single time . 
It 's a run of four and a run of three , either matching numbers or matching suit . 
Together , that is " gin . " You understand ? 
- Hey . - Hey . Still stuck on motel island . 
You want me to swim to mpu ? 
I 'm trying to get him to wait it out . 
She 's right , Jay . 
- We 're working on it . - All right . 
I heard you moved your bachelorette party to mp ... - Yeah . 
- What did you and Mike do ? 
Nothing that you 're gonna know about , because he told me that you 'd ask , and he also told me not to tell you . 
- My god ! - You guys and your bromance . 
Just promise you won 't do anything crazy . 
I did notice didn 't I ? 
Jason Grant doesn 't like having his hands tied . 
Maybe he does ? 
I don 't know yet . That 's funny . 
You know , if you 'd brought your laptop , we could actually be helping this girl . Just ... saying . 
My laptop ... Move your foot . 
You 're taking the super cop thing literally . That 's fun . 
In the trunk . - Nice . - Yeah . 
We 're in business . All right . 
Let 's fire this thing up , see if we can help Kyra . 
Oof . We gotta charge this thing . 
Son of a bitch . 
But then I saw Kyra tweeted the complete opposite just a month prior . 
I don 't know if it means anything , but it seemed suspicious . 
All right , Rome . That 's great . 
We have your contact info . We 'll be in touch . 
Nik ! 
What do you got ? 
This is Rome Carter-Lee . Welcome back to true crime with Rome . 
A little update on the Kyra de la Cruz situation . 
He 's a Philly local . He 's already called in three times . 
You thinking what ? Obsessed fan ? He runs a true crime TikTok , so he seems legit , but he 's got priors for harassment and stalking . 
What was the context ? 
Victim was a local influencer . Called in multiple times . Finally got a restraining order . 
So we took away his last target . 
Maybe he was in the market for a new one , and found Kyra ? 
Already posted a video about her . Accused her of faking her disappearance for Internet fame . 
He also threw shade at Teddy . 
Angry , jealous , and obsessed ? 
Question is ... All bark , or are we talking bite here ? 
I 'll get kemi on it . I 'm not waiting for the storm to clear . This man is dangerous . 
Don 't touch that ! 
What is it ? A hybridization Incubator . 
Hybrid ... Incubator . 
You are so smart . 
Don 't touch that either . 
- Look ... 
- Jackson . 
- Jackson . I know the storm has you stuck here too , but this is my job . This is where I work , okay ? 
I 'm still new here , and I 've worked really hard to get everyone to like me , even a little . 
Well , why wouldn 't they like you a lot ? 
Just ... sit over there until the storm passes , and let me work . 
You like musicals ? 
Like ' em ? I love ' em . 
I played fiyero . 
So you 're ... My gosh , I thought that you were ... But you 're ... Yeah , my little brother is gay . 
Well , us straight guys can like musicals too . 
Geez , was my kiss that bad ? 
We kissed ? 
We kissed . 
It was fire . 
I 'm never drinking champagne again . 
Okay . Okay , okay . Take this ! And make a list of , like , just all the hard things that I mean , just ... 
Behave ! Or I 'll lock you in the interrogation room . 
That wouldn 't be so bad . 
Okay . One battery , one inverter . 
Amazing . 
You sure this is gonna work ? 
As long as it doesn 't leak hydrogen . 
Maybe I should just move this candle . Okay . 
All right , let 's work the workaround and find this girl . 
Okay . Can I do anything ? 
Wait . It 's wet . 
That 's fair . It 's just a conductor . 
- That 's all . - It 'll be fine . 
Wow . - It worked . - All right . 
So , Rome 's theories on Kyra 's case are valid . 
Her follower count has doubled . But , then again , so has his . 
So he 's using and abusing her at the same time . 
That 's nice . And then I found this ... A tagged photo on Instagram . 
Rome met Kyra three years ago at trending con . It 's a convention for social media influencers . 
He neglected to mention that . Yep . 
And according to the comments section , they got into some kind of altercation . 
And the first time Kyra steps foot into his hometown , she goes missing ? Yeah , we do . 
Here 's Jay . 
Hey ! I haven 't seen that many candles since your last birthday cake . - That 's ... that 's hilarious . - Thank you . We lost power , but we are back up . 
What 's going on ? Rome Carter-Lee , true-crime junkie with a Kyra issue . 
I 'll dig into him . 
Because we have a convicted stalker , and that girl may have walked right into a trap . 
You care to explain why you 're in a photo with a missing girl ? Same girl you 're now exploiting for views ? 
I met hundreds of people at trending con . 
If I remembered that photo existed , I would 've used it in my video . If I knew where she was , I would 've posted it . No , we 're not concerned about your posts . What we 're concerned about is your priors . 
Emily Beck ring a bell ? 
That was a long time ago . That bitch tried to get me banned . 
" Bitch , " your mother must be proud . 
Oof , this is bad . 
What is ? 
Our colleagues just discovered that you ordered a book , " crime scene cleanup . " 
Did you make a mess , Rome ? 
Do you know the morbid stuff I have to research for my TikTok page ? 
Doesn 't mean I hurt Kyra . 
Well , it doesn 't mean that you didn 't . 
- I 'm not your guy . - I 'm telling you . It always comes down to one of the three " f " s ... Fortune , foul play , freak accident . 
And judging by the fact that your missing girl just posted a new video , I 'm guessing it 's the first . 
Yo , guys ? Come here . 
Hey , Rome was right . 
A new YouTube video just posted . 
She must have pre-recorded it and then scheduled it to drop today . 
It 's pretty common with vloggers . 
Here . Hey , everyone . 
I know it looks like I 've been crying ... ' Cause I have ... 
Teddy and I , we had a fight . 
I just need some time apart . Wait . Teddy said they didn 't fight . 
Yeah , he also said that he saw her this morning , but the last time we had sunshine was yesterday . That 's the latest she could have recorded this . 
So he lied about when she disappeared ? 
Reporting her missing isn 't a bad plan if you hurt her and you don 't want the police to find out . 
Looks like prince charming 's got some explaining to do . 
The comment section is blowing up . 
" Teddy , how could you ? " " What did you do with Kyra ? " 
Even death threats . 
The Internet 's tide turns fast . Yeah , no kidding . 
Have Helen run trace on Teddy 's wet clothes . 
I think our boy 's been playing us . 
Teddy and I , we had a fight . 
I know it looks bad ... 
No , " bad " is when you lied and you said you saw her this morning . 
Lying about a fight ? That is very , very bad . Where is she , Teddy ? 
- I don 't know . - Is she hurt ? - Is she even alive ? 
- I don 't know ! Okay ? 
We got in a fight yesterday . 
Okay . What about ? 
She wanted to put up this stupid post about engagement rings , and just kept pushing me , and I just 
I had enough . You want a lawyer , Teddy ? Because it might be a really , really good time to ask for one . 
You 're not listening . Okay ? I love her . 
I didn 't do anything . 
He 's anxious . 
The question is why . 
The hashtag " find Kyra " is trending . 
God , everyone wants a piece of the drama . 
That 's just noise . 
We need to pinpoint when she actually disappeared . 
So , I compiled her timeline using her digital footprints , so let 's see . 
All right . 10 A.M. on Sunday , Kyra posts their arrival in Philly on Instagram . 
And 12 : 13 P.M. , she posts on TikTok eating a pretzel at the Liberty bell . 
2 : 41 P.M. , a fan takes a photo with both of them at John 's water ice . 
7 P.M. , Kyra tweets from dinner at locus in rittenhouse square . 
And lastly , 8 A.M. on Monday , Kyra Instagram stories " waking up in Philly , " and they look like two happy campers . 
And the fight happened sometime after that ? 
You remember the new YouTube video that just posted ? 
See here ... the light post in her background behind her is a known height . 
And the video was recorded about 11 A.M. 
You 're brilliant . Thank you so much . Okay , so that means that the fight happened between 8 and 11 yesterday morning . 
And there 's no other online activity until 5 : 32 P.M. , when she posts a be real from a bar in Kensington . 
Bereal ? What ... 
It sends out an alert not dissimilar to ours , and it prompts the user to post a photo within two minutes . The point is ... Where you are , as you are . 
And she looked like she 'd been crying . 
Yeah , and that 's when we lose her . All right . That means that the last-known location was Kensington . 
Right ? Anything past that ? It 's a long shot , but if we could get her unpublished videos ... 
Okay , so what we 're looking for is an unpublished video that can tell us where Kyra went after she posted at 5 : 30 P.M. yesterday . 
Say no more . 
Hacking the cloud . And we ran a full jacket on Rome Carter-Lee . Anything ? 
Aside from the fact that he thinks . Kyra 's disappearance is his big break in the armchair-detective game , no , he 's clean , and cellphone data shows he hasn 't left his mom 's basement in the past month . 
Okay . That means that Teddy 's the only suspect on the board . 
I 'm in . Bad news , though ... No more scheduled uploads . 
If she auto-backs up that video cam , I can maybe access the raw footage . 
Permission to hack ? Do whatever it takes . 
All right , come on , let 's go . 
We need a break here . Yeah , no , that 's ... That 's great . I really appreciate it . Thank you so much . That was a Camden county highway patrol trooper . He saw the alert . 
One of their tail lights was out . 
Yeah , he tried to question her separately from Teddy , but she refused . He suspect abuse ? I mean , not enough to detain them . 
Tests came back from Teddy Williams 's clothes . I found a stain on his shirt . 
- It 's blood . - His own ? 
The DNA is from a female source . 
We pulled the bodycam footage from the state trooper who pulled you over last month . 
See , the thing is , Teddy , when an abuser grabs his victim 's arms , it leaves marks ... A lot like this . 
And you think I did this ? 
Little bit . Kyra fell hiking in wharton state park . 
There 's proof in one of our videos . I wouldn 't hurt her ... 
You lied about the last time you saw her . You lied about the fight . 
Because I didn 't think you would believe me , and then you wouldn 't look for her . Okay ? Like you 'd think she just dumped me or something . 
How do you explain a woman 's blood on your shirt that you wore this morning ? 
I told you , from the hiking incident . 
Look , we 're wasting time here when you should be looking for Kyra ! 
Teddy ! Hello , anybody ! 
Help ! Is there anyone there ? 
Help ! 
Yeah ? 
Hey . So , Wayne hacked Kyra 's cloud server and found footage she recorded at 8 : 30 last night . 
Hey , guys . So even though everything 's been crazy , I couldn 't come all the way to Philly and not try a cheese steak from one of the oldest places in the city . 
They 're doing a twist on the classic , so it 's a little pricey , but if I 'm gonna eat my feelings , this is the way to go . 
Is that coriander and fennel ? 
I can 't even taste the cheese . 
Is that taleggio ? 
This poor girl . 
I know . I just wanted one thing to go right today . I thought I 'd treat myself to this stupid-expensive sandwich , but it sucks , because once again , a chef takes something we all love and makes it worse . 
- Forget this place , guys . - It 's not worth your money . 
- What did you friggin ' say ? - You 're recording this ? 
- Turn the camera off . - Turn it off ! 
- Hey ! You 're hurting me ! - What the hell ? Who is that ? I.d. him . 
- Fast as you can . - Yeah . 
A helicopter ? 
I know that you 're trying to be sweet , but that is unnecessary . I 'm fine . 
Yes . Listen . We want to be discreet , and a helicopter is not discreet . 
Okay ? I gotta go . Buh-bye . 
Did mystery man just offer to send you a chopper ? 
Who is this dude ? She had four Tequila shots last night and wouldn 't tell me . 
All right , all right , all right . You will meet him at the wedding . 
That 's if he stops trying to rescue me . - He 'd better . - Mmph . 
Let 's see here . Here we go . 
Kyra 's attacker is Nico Falcone of the Falcone original . 
The place was opened by their grandmother Rose in the 1930s , and the story goes that the olivieri brothers invented the cheese steak , but Rose perfected it . 
Used to love me a whiz wit at Falcone 's . I haven 't been back since they changed the family recipe . 
Okay . You are not the only one . 
Let 's see here . 
Take a look at this . 
They 're in arrears on rent . 
And that 's not all . 
And they haven 't paid their electric in months . 
Nico was raised in Tuscany . 
When his uncle died , he came here , took over the restaurant , and he brought over some weird ideas . 
I mean , wagyu cheese steak is the dumbest of dumb , dumb ideas . 
Sounds like it . Man . 
He maxed out all of his credit cards , and he 's about to default on a loan . 
And he 's got priors . 
Possession , aggravated assault . 
All right . So we got anger issues , drug issues , hanging onto the family business by his fingernails . 
And then in walks Kyra to put one last nail into his coffin . 
Okay . So if the storm won 't let us go to Nico , let 's bring Nico to us . - Yes . 
Come on . Hello ? 
I know you ? Captain Batista , Philadelphia pd . 
- You gotta be kidding me . - I can 't talk . No , this is urgent , Mr. Falcone . No ! 
Rolling blackouts . 
We finally have a credible suspect , and the power went out . 
Nik , I saw the video . This guy is violent , he 's got priors . 
This is no good . Well , until the storm passes , we 're out of moves . The second it does . 
- Jay , no . - The city 's under water . Okay ? Stay ... 
Did you just hang up on her ? 
What do you want me to do ? 
Okay ? Somebody 's kid 's out there , most likely in trouble . 
You want me to sit here ? Man , you really don 't like being told what to do . Okay . Remind me who 's wearing an ankle monitor . Me or you ? 
Yeah , that would be me , and even I know sometimes the smartest thing that you can do is to sit down , shut up , and wait for your window . 
Wait for my window ? 
Let me ask you a question . You remember that flight back from kandahar ? 
18 hours ? Sitting on a plane , wondering what happened to Keith . Wondering where he is , not being able to do anything ? 
I am not doing trapped in this motel room when someone 's kid is out there in trouble . I just can 't do it . 
Okay ? Falcone 's is 10 blocks away . 
Fine . You wanna drown ? Be my guest . 
Hello , anybody ? Help ! Anyone ! 
No , no ! 
Help ! 
Teddy ! 
It 's ten blocks away , Nik , I 'll be fine ! 
What ? What the hell are you thinking ? 
You have no plan ! You have no backup . 
You have no idea what you 're walking into , Jay ! 
Jay ? Jay ! 
My god ! 
What 's up ? 
He 's going to Falcone 's . I 'm so done with him . Hey , hey . Relax . All right ? It 's gonna ... 
Can I make you a protein shake ? 
Listen , tragic Mike . If she wants some protein , big Mike can get it for her , okay ? 
And button up your shirt , all right ? 
We got a missing person to find . 
We 're closed , my guy . Philadelphia pd , and I 'm all good on gentrified hoagies , thanks , though . Great . Find yourself a Mickey d 's . 
No , no . I 'm actually looking to find a girl named Kyra de la Cruz . 
Do you know who that is ? No idea who you 're talking about . 
Okay , good , I 'll tell you , then . She came in last night , and she made a little video , and then you assaulted her . 
Everything good , Nico ? 
Depends who you ask . 
All right , yeah . She slammed my food , so I slammed her camera . Tell her to invoice . 
No . You see , it 's not about the camera . 
She 's missing . 
I 'm just curious , do you assault all your customers , or is it just the ones who don 't like your crappy food ? Whoa , whoa , wait . Missing ? - Yeah , missing . 
- And you think I ... No , no , no ! You got this all wrong , amico . 
- I do ? - Yeah . 
Okay . What happened to your Van outside ? 
I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . You don 't know what I 'm talking about . 
What 's your name ? 
J-Johnny . Johnny . How you doing , Johnny ? 
You okay ? Yeah , no , I 'm good . 
Are you on drugs , Johnny ? - No , I don 't ... 
- Then why are you shaking ? Why are you nervous ? What 's going on ? 
No , i-I 'm good . 
You gotta tell me , ' cause I 'm a cop . 
Tell me what 's going on . Tell me ! 
Listen , man ... - I-I was gonna tell you . 
- Tell me what ? After you knocked her camera , and you went into the back , I told her she had to delete the footage . What the hell , Johnny ? W-What do you mean ? 
What 'd you do ? 
Girl 's got , like , a million followers ! 
You know how that crap spreads ! She drove off , I followed . 
Hold on . Hold on . You followed her , and then what ? 
I just lost it ! 
Okay ? I was mad . I swiped her Van , a-and she spun off the side of the road . 
- Johnny , what the hell ? 
- What , you just left her there ? - That 's ... 
- I ... Listen , it was an accident ! 
Listen , I panicked . I know I should 've stayed , but I didn 't want to cause any trouble . Well , what the hell do you call this ? You could ruin us , Johnny ! Okay , okay ! 
Where was this ? Fishtown somewhere . 
- Hey . 
What 's up ? - Hey . Kemi , do me a favor ... Pull up all the traffic cams from last night in fish town . 
Kyra was run off the road . 
Yeah , I got you . 
Nikki ! 
Okay , so , restaurant is closed . 
Until that girl is safe , you guys stay put . 
And wagyu cheesesteaks ? Come on , my guy ! 
Where the hell am I going , kemi ? 
The power 's still out and I am working off of my hotspot , but I don 't know . At this rate , Jason , I don 't know . 
My god . What 'd they do to her ? 
Okay , guys ! I 'm sorry to interrupt , but I am driving blind . 
Okay , we 're working on it . 
You don 't think you 're gonna find her , do you ? 
Okay . Power 's on , Jay ! Excellent . Praise the gods ! - This is good . 
This is good . - Bear with me . 
Bear with me . Fishtown is a maze . 
Now we 're cooking with gas . 
East on susquehanna , near the Delaware expressway . 
It looks like she rolled over into a flood way . My god .
