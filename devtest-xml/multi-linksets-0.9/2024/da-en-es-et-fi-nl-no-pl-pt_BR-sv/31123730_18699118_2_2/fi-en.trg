Dear friends , it is here that we finally arrive at the very heart and soul of our great journey . 
This ... is Market Street ! 
Though , much has changed since I owned a home at the intersection of Fourth . But one thing remains consistent young Ava sells brownies so rich that King George would attempt to tax them without representation . 
So Go forth , good citizens , and spend ! 
As always , you 're the high point of my day , Benji . Ooh , dessert . I want a blondie . Can I have one ? 
The truffle brownie is my favorite . 
Do I know you from somewhere ? 
Perhaps , uh , the Masonic Lodge ? 
No , I 'm serious . 
You ever been to Kansas City ? 
I don 't believe so . Is 
That one of the new townships amongst the colonies ? 
Young miss , do you know what else occurred here on Market Street ? 
My famous experiment with electricity . 
Grandpa ! Look what I found ! Oh , let me see . 
Oh , wow . That 's nice . 
Jealous ? No . 
Are you kidding me ? Jason is entitled to his privacy . He 's allowed to have friends . I 'd just be , uh , calling in a favor . I-I appreciate that , but I don 't ... 
Wait a minute . That room was empty , right ? - Yep . - Did you hire ... ? No . Uh ... 
Good morning . Uh , good morning . Hi . 
Pink for you , Captain Batista . And purple for you , Detective Adebayo . 
Oh , uh ... Kemi 's fine . I 'm sorry , who are you ? 
Helen your new forensic scientist . 
I don 't remember requesting any additional personnel . 
I was assigned by Inspector Braun . So the Inspector put you here ? 
I thought he told you . 
Oh , well surprise ! I love surprises . Especially ones that come bearing gifts . 
Go ahead , open them . 
Yeah , hey , I 'll go first . Look at that . 
" Ooh , gifts ! " Heh , heh . 
Oh , is this ... um ... 
A Cadbury Creme Egg . Oh ... 
They 're so good . 
I didn 't really get it , but figured you can 't go wrong with Cadbury . 
They are really good . Thank you so much . 
Nice to meet you , Helen . 
I need to call the Inspector . 
You ... You forgot this ! 
I look forward to working together . Okay . 
If you 're not gonna stop for coffee , you gotta bring coffee that 's , like , Partner 101 . 
Look , I 'm not the one who made us late . 
You know what ? It wasn 't my idea for us to drive together ... that was you . 
Yeah , because Braun 's gonna be watching us . All right ? We gotta be on point . 
Oh , so this is a thing ? So , what , are you ... You 're like my babysitter now , or ... ? 
Absolutely not . No . I 'm your partner . Oh . Unless you 're gonna act like a baby . 
Okay , " partner . " 
I have been thinking a lot about the Maritz car bombing ... 
No , please don 't . " Please don 't , " what ? 
This guy Maritz , he gets out , two seconds later , kabloom ? 
That doesn 't make you think ? Yeah , it does , all right ? But I 'm thinking about Nikki . Braun was clear . Case belongs to Homicide now . 
Okay , so please don 't put her in a bad spot with her new boss . Okay ? Just for once , be professional , drop it . 
Me be professional ? - Yeah . - Okay . 
Singing an engagement in front of the whole office ? 
Okay , one , okay ... I was singing my ass off . 
- Yeah , that 's fine . - Okay , yeah . 
I cleared it with H.R. It was a beautiful moment . 
It was a beautiful moment ! It was a beautiful , unprofessional moment . 
All right , if you say so . 
Hey , Kemi . Ahem . 
Glad you called , ' cause Mike here was about to serenade me . Aww ! Are you proposing to him , too ? - That 's nice . 
- All right , all right ! See ? See ? 
Unprofessional ! 
Just admit it ! 
Um , are you guys close ? 
We 've got a strange situation here . 
" Benjamin Franklin " is missing ? I cannot tell a lie . 
Our founding father compatriot has disappeared . 
We work for the Walking History Colonial Tour Company . 
I 'm Alexander Hamilton . 
Some of us are pretty strict about breaking character . 
You don 't say . 
Ben Franklin bailed today in the middle of one of his tours , but the guy was usually a total pro even more into his character than George here . 
He would never run out on a job . So you 're worried something happened to him ? 
I didn 't know the guy behind the glasses or anything , like I said he didn 't break the act , but he was nice ... bit older than most of us . 
I don 't know . It 's weird he didn 't come back . 
Hamilton ? 
- Mm-hmm . - Did he rap ? 
Oh , you 're just so funny ! 
Is that the room where it happened ? 
- Don 't do that . - Okay . 
All right , so what ... what are we dealing with ? We got our old guy , forgets to take his pills , he gets confused ? 
We got a " Silver Alert " situation ? 
No , it 's , um , it 's more than that . 
This guy never broke character ... like , ever . 
Um , we don 't have a name , let alone verification of his age . 
We 've got uniforms canvassing the area , taking statements from the tour group , but from all accounts , the man just disappeared . 
Detective Grant . Yeah ? 
Sergeant Sherman . 
I 'm Helen , your new forensic scientist . Oh . What is that ... an evidence tech ? 
Did Nikki ... 
Braun . A gift for our team in the field , who , from the case files I 've read like the Yin and Yang represent the inseparable contradictory . 
That 's good . 
It 's appropriate , too . One 's white ... and one 's black . - Okay ... - Oh , look at that . 
Oh , I didn 't mean to ... 
The tour company had very little useful information . 
They had a disconnected phone number and P.O. box address . 
We need to check local hospitals and urgent care . Gotcha . 
Name on file for our Ben Franklin is , uh , " Richard Saunders . " Oh . 
Uh ... you 're not gonna find anything . Okay . One of my previous existences involved a very physically gratifying relationship with the founding father in question . Fix your face . Yes , it did . 
Sounds cool . 
What does she mean ? 
She ... played " hide the pickle " with Ben Franklin in a past life . 
All right , we did more than share a bed . 
In that time , I was exposed to some of his other creative endeavors , which included writings that he published under his pen name , " Richard Saunders . " 
As in , Poor Richard 's Farming Almanac anyone , no ? 
So our fake Ben Franklin is using the same pseudonym as the real Ben Franklin ? 
And he would occasionally use " Richard Saunders " to refer to other things ... you know what I 'm sayin ' ? 
Is she joking ? She 's not . 
We may not know who this man really is , but he is missing , and it 's our job to find him . 
He 's an elderly tour guide . 
How much trouble could he be in ? Huh ? 
Hey . So , we checked all the local hospitals for Richard Saunders . Oh , let me guess . You were right , and there 's nothing ? I appreciate you checking . Mm-hmm . 
Something else ? 
You seemed concerned about the new evidence tech , Helen ? 
So , I called around , and , um , she has been transferred a lot . 
In spite of her spotless evidential integrity record ? 
What 's her story ? 
She 's good at science , not so good at people . It seems that her personality has clashed with too many superiors , and it 's all been lateral moves . Homicide , Vice , Cold Case , to us . 
So what , she 's our problem now ? 
Hey , you know as well as I do that the label of a " difficult woman " can stifle a career . 
Maybe she just needs the right mentors . 
â  ª I am so proud â  ª If I allowed â  ª My family pride to be my guide â  ª â  ª I am so proud ... I stand by what I just said . â  ª If I allowed - [ chuckles ] Yeah . 
I got something from Patrol . 
Said our missing Ben Franklin tossed this key to a kid , so there could be prints on it . 
Have Ethel Merman take a look . - Okay . - Who ? 
Just don 't , don 't ... don 't worry about it . 
Oh ... kay . Hi . Hey , what do you got ? 
Everyone and their brother must 've handled this thing because I 've got dozens of partials to sort through . 
Are you happy about that ? 
There is a fungus among us ! 
Those little specks on the key are from a strain of black mold called Stachybotrys atra , which , by itself , isn 't too informative , since toxic mold can grow anywhere where there 's water damage . 
But , this key most skeleton keys are brass or iron , but this key is made of bronze , and see the simple double-tooth design ? Yeah ? It 's a ward key , common to buildings from the late-1700s . 
Okay , so we 're looking for a colonial-era building ... with a black mold problem . Oh , geez . 
What ? 
Ben Franklin 's Quaker Meeting House it was converted into a boarding school decades ago , and has been shut down for months because of black mold . 
Looks like a good place to hide out . - Yep . - Uh ... - Guys ? - Yeah ? 
The school burned down an hour ago . 
All right . I 'll grab Jason and head over . - All right . - Good luck ! 
Nice work , Helen . 
Uh , thanks ! 
Can I ask you something ? Yeah . Sure . Have you heard of cryptomnesia ? 
It 's an implicit memory phenomenon where people mistakenly attribute a thought , idea , or an experience as their own a mental condition . 
Are you suggesting that my past lives are " a mental condition " ? 
That ... that sounded bad . Little bit . 
You know , just a tip most people wait at least a week before they call me crazy . 
Damn . 
Okay , well , we got some accelerant here . So , kind of a lay-up . It 's definitely arson . 
Smells like a tire factory in here . What is that ? Latex ? 
These tour guides kinda go all out , right ? 
Makeup , wigs ... 
Fat suit ? 
There you go . 
We should bag that up for the new girl , see if she can pull trace . 
Can I ask you um , what do you think about the new girl ? 
You 're not dating the new girl , all right ? 
Besides , you can 't handle her show tunes . 
I-I don 't want to date the new girl . That 's the girl , in high school , you cheated off her paper to get an " A. " 
Well , she 's very sweet . 
She gave me Skittles . 
I didn 't get Skittles . 
Yeah , well , you don 't deserve ' em . 
Fair enough . Hey , I got something . What , a charred mattress ? 
No . Watch out . 
Can we borrow that ? 
Found a lot of hidden contraband in mattresses in my day . 
We got photographs . 
Well , I 'll be damned . 
So now we have a mystery founding father and a mystery woman ? 
The photo isn 't clean enough for facial recognition . 
I tried databases and social media ... nothing . 
And the Quaker School ? 
Sorry to keep you waiting our printer ran out of colored ink . All ... 
All this from the burn site ? 
- I 'm thorough . - Yeah ! 
I bet you got all " A " s in school . Right ? 
I pulled a print off the partially congealed body suit . 
If you flip to the last page ... 
- Okay . - Okay . Uh , Benjamin Franklin , his real name is Owen Maloy . 
Mm , an old-school enforcer for the Irish Mob out of North Philly . 
He 's got a bunch of priors and was a P.O.I. in a dozen other cases , but it looks like he fell off the grid 20 years ago . 
There was a big power shift in the Irish Mob around then . 
Maybe he ratted ? Owen would want to disappear and hide out under a fake identity . All right . 
Who chooses Ben Franklin as a fake I.D. , number one number two ... " disappearing " 
and " hiding out " are two very different things . 
You wanna vanish , you 'd leave the state , you leave Philly . Why ... Why stick around ? But this picture 's 20 years old . - Hey , Kemi ? - Yeah ? We still have C 's age-progression program , right ? 
Yeah , I 'll run the mug shot through it . 
Once that 's done , put out the Alert , and let 's keep digging on the girl . 
We have to find her before Maloy . 
He has an obvious interest and a history of violence . 
Hands on the wheel , ten and two . Okay , pally , take it easy . Wait . 
Owen ? Who else did you tell ? 
That was you this morning ? Who else did you tell ? 
Nobody ! 
We thought you were dead . 
I 'm not gonna tell anybody I saw you . 
I swear , Owen ! 
I have a family ! Yeah . 
So do I. 
- Kemi . - Yeah ? I just sent something to your screen . Okay . 
That ... is Charlie McGannon , the current Irish Mob boss . 
Philly PD has a half-dozen investigations running on him , as does FBI . 
Okay , so you said there was a big power shift 20 years ago , when our missing enforcer , Owen , went off the grid . 
According to this , Charlie 's father , the old boss , was murdered . 
That 's when Charlie took over . 
No arrests were ever made , but Charlie always believed that his dad was killed by one of his own people . 
You think Owen killed the old man ? 
I mean , maybe ... 
All right . It 's been driving me crazy . I 've been thinking about this girl in the photo , right ? 
If there 's a mob hit on this guy , Owen if that 's what we 're dealing with why stick around , right ? 
One person on the planet I 'd do that for . Sidney . 
This is the girl in the photos . That 's Owen 's daughter . 
Okay , so Owen killed the boss and has been hiding from the mob to watch over his kid ever since ? 
And our Alert put him back in Charlie 's crosshairs . That 's the theory ? This guy ? This guy is a maniac , okay ? 
He 's , like , he makes . Scorsese movies look like bedtime stories . 
Uh , we 're getting alert responses that Owen is fleeing a car in Kensington . 
I 'll get Mike . Yes . 
Keep looking for Ava . Yeah , will do . 
A witness saw Owen exit the car and another one spotted him heading south . 
That 's blood . Yeah . Guy 's still here . 
Nikki warned us that 's a mob hangout . So ? 
So , what , a guy gets mugged and he doesn 't call the cops ? 
Probably means he doesn 't want to speak to us . 
You know how many open cases have that place under surveillance ? 
We need approval to go in there . Approval ? 
Right . Well , um , there 's an open case with a missing mob enforcer . 
This is a known mob hangout . What are we talking about ? 
Look , we go barging in there , No , but we have a good reason . 
I 'm thirsty . Come on . 
Would you just relax ? Relax . 
How you doing ? 
Hey , uh , can I get a couple club sodas , please ? 
We 're all out of club soda . 
That right ? 
Is it that obvious we look like cops ? Huh ? 
It 's his shoes , right ? Is that what it is ? 
Okay . 
Um ... I tried , you know , and now we gotta do something different . 
Look , I don 't know what you 're thinking about doing , - but don 't . - Okay . Okay , Got it . 
- Hey , hey . Be cool . Be cool ! - Hey ! I 'm cool . Pay attention , okay ? All right ? 
Hey , everything 's fine . 
I 'm a police officer , Philadelphia Police Department . 
Um , anybody see what happened outside with the Chrysler ? The car , huh ? 
Anyone ? 
Ah-hah . Uh , gentleman in the back , rubbing his neck , kinda like ... Yeah , like he got clocked in the head . 
How was that for cool ? You like that ? 
" No club soda . " 
Hey . Wanna tell us what happened ? 
Someone tried to carjack me . No . 
No , nobody tried to carjack you . Okay ? 
Your car is sitting in the parking lot right now . 
All right , his name is Owen Maloy , he took off on foot . 
We know you know him . We just want to know how you know him . 
We shot that together . 
Is that you and Charlie McGannon ? 
Okay , so you guys go back . Right ? And then what ? 
Why 'd he come at you ? 
Why 'd Owen hit you on the head ? 
Thought he was dead for years , and then this morning , I 'm taking my grandkids for a tour , and there he is dressed up like Ben Franklin , of all things ! 
Oh , yeah , right . So , what ... what did he want ? 
Guy next to Charlie that 's old man McGannon . He was the boss . 
Owen took him out and went into hiding . 
Now he wants to see if anybody else knows if he 's still in town . 
Okay , well , who else knows ? 
Nah . Owen made a mistake . Said he 's got family . 
Now we know how to find him . 
Pete ... why don 't you take it easy ? 
Yeah . I got nothin ' else for ya . 
All right . Let 's go . 
Okay , we-we gotta get to Owen 's daughter before Charlie McGannon and the Irish Mob does . 
And they have a head start . 
Hey , talk to me . Where are we on the daughter ? Okay . 
So the History Tours ' office sent us everything that they had on Ben Franklin since Owen was hired . This is the old Ben Franklin 's route ... Mm-hmm ? And this is a route that Owen requested . Ava probably works on his route . 
Yes . Get patrol to check these businesses . We gotta get her off the street . I got you . 
Ms. Dufrain ? Captain Batista . 
What 's going on ? The officers wouldn 't say . 
I 'm sorry for the confusion . 
We 're still piecing things together . 
What can you tell me about your father ? 
My father ? Uh , nothing . I 've never met him . 
He died when I was young . 
Well , we believe your dad is still alive . 
We searched birth records and we discovered that your father 's a man named Owen Maloy . 
You may recognize him as this . 
That 's Benji . He 's my friend , he comes into the shop , tells his customers to be nice to me . 
He 's not my dad . 
You know , my mom told me he was murdered . He was killed for something he didn 't do . 
Did she say what that was ? 
Ava , we are trying to find him before something happens to him . 
If the shop doesn 't get opened , I don 't get paid , so I have to go . 
I would advise against that . 
The people looking for Owen may think you know how to find him , but I can 't force you to stay . 
Um , if he makes contact please call . 
Charlie McGannon . Hey , Nikki . 
It 's been a long time . 
How you doing ? - Uh ... 
- Yeah . My office . 
What can I do you for , Charlie ? 
You haven 't changed . I hear you and your people are looking for Owen Maloy . 
Is that a fact ? 
It is . 
Right ? You know it is . 
- Hiya . 
- Hey . 
Uh , hey , um that 's , um ... that 's Charlie McGannon . 
Told you to be cool at that bar , but you had to go storming in , huh ? - " Storming " ? - Yeah . Now we got the head of the Irish Mob sitting at Nikki 's desk ! - I wouldn 't say " storming . " - Thanks a lot ! 
That 's storming , now . What you 're doing , that is " storming . " 
Hey , Nik . 
Sorry to interrupt . Can I talk to you for a second ? Uh , not now , Sergeant . 
Whatever it is , it can wait . 
Everything good ? 
Everything 's good . 
Nik dipping your pen in the company well , huh ? 
What do you want from me , Charlie ? 
Nothing . 
I 'd like you and your people to do absolutely nothin ' . 
Owen Maloy is my problem . 
I 'll handle him . 
Got it ? 
We 've known each other a lot of years . I don 't remember , ever , a moment where I worked for you . 
Think of it as a favor to an old friend . 
I don 't recall us being friends , either . 
Ah , don 't kid yourself , Nikki . 
I was there , remember ? 
Treated you like a little sister when your marriage was falling apart . 
You wanted to climb the ranks real fast , make Captain . 
And , uh ... mm , hey . 
You fed me intel , pointed me toward arrests ... but this is different . You never asked me to look the other way back then . 
Our past business doesn 't color our present , Charlie . 
Coming down here is me being courteous . Respectful . 
Don 't give me a reason not to be . 
Due respect , I am so sorry you wasted your time . 
We are MPU , and we 're gonna find this missing person . 
All right . Have it your way . 
Be seeing you , Nikki . 
That is right on time . 
Well , I owe you that much , at least . 
What do you mean ? 
I 'm sorry about bringing McGannon in on you . 
I can 't believe he just walked in here . Oh , no . You didn 't do that . 
Charlie came here because of me . 
There 's just some things you don 't know . 
What are you talking about ? I 'm a woman of color in a male-dominated profession . 
No one was looking out for me , so I looked out for myself . 
Charlie wasn 't as powerful then as he is now . 
I busted him for drugs on a random vehicle search , and ... I flipped him . 
So , wait . He 's a rat ? 
He was my C.I. 
He fed me intel that led to a lot of solid arrests . 
Well , Charlie 's crew doesn 't have as much competition as it used to . 
It sounds like he was feeding you intel on his rivals . 
Fastest way to end a mob war is to help one side win . Aw , damn , Nik ! 
So what was he doing ... he 's calling in a favor ? 
The mob is after our missing person , Owen . 
Rumor is , he killed Charlie 's dad . That 's why he went into hiding . Hey . It 's okay . 
We 're gonna do our jobs and we 're gonna bring Owen in alive . 
What 's this ? 
Uh , some really interesting facts about the psychology behind a belief in past-lives . 
It 's funny , ' cause I didn 't ask for your opinion . 
It 's not my opinion . It 's ... science . 
You know , people have , uh , judged my beliefs my whole life . 
I do well without their acceptance . You should try it . 
What do you mean ? 
Has it occurred to you that the reason that you 've been transferred so much is because you 're trying too hard ? 
Focus on the job . Not me , the job . 
There 's a missing person with a bull 's-eye on his back who could use our help . 
Sorry . 
I 'm closed for the day . 
I 'm sorry . 
For what ? 
That 's my mom . 
She had this same picture . How did you ... 
That 's us . 
That was my copy . 
You 're my dad ? 
I don 't understand . 
Uh , it 's , uh ... I can 't explain right now . 
There 's no time . 
There 's a number saved on there . 
Just wait a few days , call it , and when it 's safe we 'll talk . 
Ava seeing you was always the highlight of my day , too . 
Get out of here . 
You have to run ... now ! 
I love you . 
Hey , I got Ava set up in your office . 
She doesn 't know anything . Her head 's spinning . 
She meets her dad for the first time after she thinks he 's dead , then he 's taken . 
Well , not just taken . Witnesses said that he was pushed into a blue van . 
Kemi tracked it on traffic cams , but lost the van heading out of the city . 
Yeah , well , Charlie 's got him , and if he 's convinced that Owen 's the one that popped his old man , he 's gonna kill him . 
Well , not yet . I just got word he 's here . 
Who 's here ? 
He 's being set up in interrogation . Go make sure he 's comfortable . 
What did you do ? 
I went through the cases being built on Charlie . I found something actionable to bring him in for questioning . 
Okay , what did you find ? Unpaid parking tickets . 
Nikki , that is insane ! 
His lawyers are gonna have him out of here in an hour . 
Am I missing something ? 
Charlie 's men won 't kill Owen without Charlie 's say-so . 
His cell phone is currently in evidence . 
As long as he is here , he cannot make the call to execute Owen . 
So , you 're right his lawyer will have him outta here in an hour , which means we have an hour to find Owen Maloy . 
Here you go . I already told you guys what I know . I know , Ava . 
I know how hard this has been for you . 
It 's like my dad was brought back to life and then killed all over again . 
I-It 's so weird ... the whole Ben Franklin thing . 
Oh , it 's not so weird . 
If I was in your father 's situation , and I had to stay away from my baby . I couldn 't do it , either . 
He loved you . 
If I help you find him , is he going to prison ? 
Probably . 
But he 'll be alive . 
He gave this to me . 
You 're doing the right thing . 
There was one number stored , and I was able to track it in transit . 
They were taking I-476 north of Allentown , before the signal dropped ... here . 
They probably found the phone and smashed it . 
They 're headed into the Poconos . 
Wait . The-The cabin . 
W-We found a photo of a hunting cabin at Charlie 's bar ... that might be in the Poconos . Get Jason and head that way . 
Wait a minute there are hundreds of cabins in the Poconos . 
They 'll be flying blind . Then we better narrow down the search before they get there . - Come on . - All right . 
No word from the boss . 
Pete , you gotta listen to me ! 
I didn 't kill the old man . 
Shut him up , will ya ? 
We 'll keep you posted . 
Park Services and local law enforcement are ready to respond they just need a direction . 
There are no Poconos properties listed under Charlie McGannon or any known associates . 
God , if I just had an image of the cabin I could ... I have a picture ! Mike told me about the cabin , so I did an Internet search of the pub and saw a customer review with a selfie . 
It had the photo in it , so I blew it up . 
The digital copy is in your , uh , inbox . 
Thank you . How did you think to look this up ? 
I wanted to help . 
There 's a missing person in trouble . 
Okay , um let 's try the truck . 
Nothing there . 
Um Maybe there 's a house number . 
Oh Anything over there ? 
Oh , my God . 
D-Does that narrow our search ? 
Yes , it does ! A little bit closer , a little bit closer here we go . 
That-That 's Chinkapin Oak . 
Do you see the shape of the leaves ? They 're oblong , with undulated lobes . 
Chinkapin Oak grows almost exclusively in and around Martin 's Creek ! Well done , Helen ! My girl ! - Let Mike know . - Okay . Dammit . What ? 
That 's Charlie 's lawyer . 
Owen 's out of time . 
Charlie should 've called by now . 
I don 't like this . 
I am so sorry for the inconvenience . 
Save it , Nikki . Give me my phone . What ? Nobody brought it up ? 
It 's probably still in evidence . 
I got you where you are today . 
Don 't think I can 't undo that . 
Good news is , I got your phone right here . Bad news is , some joker in evidence was streaming Masterchef on it , and the battery died . 
Thank you . 
Get him outside . 
Philly PD ! 
One down ! 
Hey , I got the angle . 
Where 's Owen ? Hey , hey , hey , hey ! 
I surrender . 
Owen Maloy ? 
Sorry 
Now I surrender . 
Hands behind your back . 
You good , Mike ? 
Yeah . 
Irish Mafia Cabin . How may I help you ? 
They hung up . 
Let me ask you something . 
You could 've been hiding anywhere , doing anything . 
Why Ben Franklin ? 
Benjamin Franklin owned people . 
The last thing he wrote was a letter to Congress asking them to end slavery . 
He showed that people can change , and in the end , be remembered for the good things they did , not the bad . 
I like that idea . 
It was you the whole time ? 
I couldn 't stay away . 
It was your first day , yet you got us gifts . So , you should get something . 
A cactus ? 
Yeah , shop next door didn 't have much of a selection . 
Sorry . I owe you an apology . I ... 
I shouldn 't have snapped at you before . I 'm sorry . No , no , no , no ! I 'm sorry . 
I don 't like being painted with that brush either . 
My mom 's Bipolar . 
A-As a kid , I had a hard time with it . 
It was like her neurodivergence made me feel crazy . 
A-And when I got to school , and started learning about psychology , and the scientific reasons why she behaved that way it was like - a cloud lifted . - Mm . 
It all made sense . 
Hmm . I-I gave you those articles to show you that I didn 't think you were crazy . Ha ! 
But I-I know , I know ... I 've gotta ... I 've gotta dial it back . No , no , no . 
I-I ... I get it . You know , science is your practice . 
I lead with my heart . 
Um , my faith is my guide , but there 's room for both . 
Mm . And , you know , we have , um , plenty of time to find our stride now that you 're on the team . 
Great first day . 
Yo . You , um , you have friends in Homicide , right ? Yeah , why ? I mean , they good enough friends where you can , uh , let me know when the report comes out on the Maritz bombing ? 
There 's literally no way for me to say " Leave it alone " that you 're gonna understand , is there ? 
You all right ? What 's the matter ? Nah . Just something from earlier . 
Charlie McGannon . 
You know anything about their arrangement ? 
Let me ask you a question . Are you mad that she has a mob connect , or that you didn 't know about it ? 
Can I say both ? 
Yeah . 
Just give you some advice uh , Nikki can handle herself . Don 't ... Don 't try to white-knight her . 
" White " ? 
Really ? Everything 's not about race , Mike . 
Oh , I 'm just saying ... " White knight " is good . " Black knight " is bad . 
I mean , can a brother save the day ? Jay . 
Yeah ? 
Thanks . 
And , seriously leave it alone . 
Sure . 
You 're a good sport . 
Come down here to gloat ? 
I had a chat with Owen about why he went into hiding . 
And , uh ... I mean , the word was that he was a traitor who killed the boss , your dad . 
But Owen has a different story . 
And the way he tells it , he was approached about the hit , but he stayed loyal to the old man . 
Your dad got killed anyway . Owen became a scapegoat while you consolidated power . 
Your own dad , Charlie ? 
That 's ... That 's a new low . 
And what exactly do you plan to do with that little piece of unfounded gossip ? 
Nothing . Unless something happens to Ava . 
Or Owen . 
Come on , Nikki . Have a drink with me . 
Oh , no . Just like the old days . Let 's go . 
No . This is ... this is different , Charlie . I , um ... I 'm getting married . 
You 've rocked the boat enough . 
FiancÃ © doesn 't like you having old friends ? 
Didn 't seem to me to be the controlling type . 
Until today , there was no reason Mike needed to know about that part of my life . 
It 's in the past . Now he thinks I 'm keeping secrets from him . 
Aren 't ya ? 
We made a good team back then . 
We were never a team . 
There was just a time where our interests aligned . 
And now ? 
They don 't . 
You take care ... Captain Batista . I always do .
