Alexi zinman wins the face off for the bullfrogs . 
Nice shot , Alexi ! 
Way to follow up ! Way to follow up . Good ! 
Nice shot , Alexi ! 
Take it easy ! 
Alexi ! 
Back on the bench ! 
Do not go out there ! 
Get Alexi outta there ! 
Break it up ! 
Where 's Alexi ? Where 's Alexi ? Where 's Alexi ? 
Hey . You wanted to see me ? 
Close the door . Wow . 
What 'd I do ? Doesn 't sound good . 
Well , I got an email from the department of prisons about your rescheduled visit to frackville . 
Yeah , the Logan barlowe interview . I had to reschedule it because of the storm . Why 'd they email you ? It was a courtesy . Problem is that homicide was copied , which means that inspector braun could find out what we 're doing here . 
I think maybe you 're being a little paranoid . 
Braun took Logan barlowe 's confession himself . 
Okay ? He hand-delivered him to the D.A. 
It is his case , Jay . 
I-I-I know that . 
So what is your point ? What are you saying ? 
If he 's going to find out from somebody , I want it to be from me . I need to get ahead of this . 
I don 't know , I think it 's better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission . 
When have you ever begged for forgiveness , Jay ? 
Fifth grade . I broke a buddy of mine 's retainer , and his parents were very upset , so I 
I need to respect the chain of command . That 's all . 
And suspicion is also earned . 
What do you think that braun has earned more of ? 
I don 't trust him any more than you do , but I need to do some damage control here . 
I 'll call . 
Yes , this is captain Batista . 
Does the inspector have an opening today ? 
Good morning , officer Brooks . 
Detective adebayo . 
This is officer Franks from the 9th district . 
I just picked up one of your c.I.S , shoplifting . I 'm sorry , my what ? 
She claims to be one of your informants . Has your business card and everything . 
Can I speak with her ? 
Hey , kemi . 
Maya , is that you ? 
You said if I ever needed anything , I could call . Well , I 'm calling . 
Excuse me ... 
Excuse me . A-Are you bud bingham ? 
Wow , it 's been a minute since anyone recognized me . 
I 'm Mike sherman . 
It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 'm a really big fan . 
I appreciate that , so ... So , do you work for the missing persons unit ? 
Yes , sir . I need to talk to someone . 
I think one of my boys is in trouble . 
Alexi seemed fine during the shoot-around , then a couple minutes into the first period , he and his man drop their gloves , and they go at it . 
When the dust cleared , Alexi was gone . 
I mean , we searched everywhere . 
Was ... was fighting a frequent thing with Alexi ? 
Never . 
No , his game was speed and finesse . 
Guys like me made their living making sure the guys like Alexi never got touched on the ice . 
I was what you might call an agitator . 
Yes , you were . 
I mean , I watch your fight highlights all the time . I mean , you was whipping people 's a 
in Philadelphia history , so , I 'm a big fan . 
Well , it 's a real honor to meet you then , bud . 
Well , those days are long gone . 
Look , I never had a family of my own . 
These kids are my world . 
Especially Alexi . The boy 's got the heart of a champion . 
What 's he like off the ice ? He 's a good kid , you know ? 
Maybe a little more sensitive than most . 
His uncle 's doing his best to take care of him , but man , that kid can fly . 
And he loved the game like I did . 
Running out in the middle like that ? Makes no sense . 
I don 't know , maybe there was something said during the fight ? 
There were scouts at the game today . 
Only the program 's top players get the scholarships , and Alexi was the best we 've seen in years . 
Today 's game would 've closed the deal for him , and he knew it ! 
He wouldn 't just walk away , not if he had a choice . 
You think one of the other kids was angling for his scholarship ? 
I don 't know what to think . I don 't know . 
I 'm assuming you tried calling him ? Alexi doesn 't have a phone . 
I tried calling his uncle , but apparently the line 's out of order . 
What about his teammates ? 
Nobody 's heard a thing . 
He 's a great player , captain , but he 's just a kid ... And I 'm scared as hell . 
Thank you . 
Yeah , bud bingham was the man for a young black kid growing up in Philly . 
You know he once scored a goal without taking a shot ? See , there was an empty net , and he just-just-just ... one second . I don 't , understand hockey . I don 't ... I don 't like the game . I don 't know why people like the game . What is " icing , " anyway ? Explain that to me . 
It 's when you 're behind the red center line and you dump the puck ... " dump the puck " ? 
Right . Whatever . You call yourself a sports fan ? All right . 
This is Alexi 's stuff . Bud said it has not been touched since he left this morning . 
Skates are still here . 
Pads , stick . This stuff 's not cheap , either . In fact , it 's brand-new . I thought bud said they were barely getting by . I don 't know . 
Either way , it 's not the kind of stuff you 'd leave behind , unless you 're in a rush , right ? 
This is also us guessing . 
There 's no witnesses . 
Maybe one . I 'll be right back . 
Put all that stuff on . 
All right , we want to see the footage right after the game started . 
What exactly we looking for ? 
I didn 't hear about a break-in . 
It 's actually a break-out . That 's the angle right there . 
There he is . That 's him . 
Yeah , that 's Alexi , all right . 
Okay . Lookit , he 's running like the bogeyman 's chasing him . He 's scared . 
All right , I 'm calling Nikki . 
We need the alert . 
All right . So this is our missing person , Alexi , and his uncle , Jerry zinman . 
The hockey league had an address on file , but it was for a motel that they haven 't stayed at for the last six months . 
And according to bud bingham , uncle Jerry spent every last cent that he had on the hockey program . 
Yeah , which makes running out in the middle of a game all the more suspicious . 
Speaking of suspicious , the names Alexi and Jerry zinman come up empty on the system , and that much nothing means something ... 
Why use an alias ? Who are they hiding from ? 
Alexi 's teammates also confirmed that he wasn 't a fighter . I mean , that 's the last thing he did before he disappeared . So why pick a fight ? 
Not to get technical , but in the game footage , it looked like they both dropped their gloves . 
It 's a common hockey thing if you want to settle a beef . 
I don 't know , maybe the kid from the other team can enlighten us . 
Yeah , go talk to him . Find out how bad he wanted that scholarship . 
And worst case , maybe it can get us to the mysterious uncle Jerry . Let me see . Hopefully . 
Can I get a minute ? - Yeah , of course . 
- Thank you . 
She is all yours , detective . Thank you . I 'll take it from here . 
Hi . 
Long time , no see . 
Thanks so much . Can I have another bowl ? 
In a minute . 
Walk with me , and explain yourself . 
Well , things were better after you guys dropped me off , but for about two weeks , though , until my parents told me I was going to boarding school . 
Sacred academy in New Jersey , and if the name didn 't give it away , it 's supes religious . 
Day one , the teacher told us to turn to page 55 , and rip it out . 
I thought it was gonna be about , like , creative writing , but nope ! It was about same-sex relationships . 
The teacher just told us to throw it in the trash . 
Look , I can appreciate how that must 've made you feel , but can you skip to the part where you got busted for shoplifting ? 
I bailed , okay ? 
I didn 't have any friends there . No one I can be myself with . So last weekend , 
I took a train to Philly , and I just stayed . 
It was cold , I needed gloves , I got caught . Whatever . 
Why didn 't you call your parents ? I 'm pretty sure my dad would 've let me stay in lockup . 
And you think I won 't ? 
Maya , I gave you that number for emergencies , not a get-outta-jail-free card . 
If you can 't help me , I get it . 
I just wasn 't sure what else to do . 
Is your homework in there ? 
Okay , good , because you 're gonna finish it all while I think about what I 'm gonna do with you . 
Captain Batista ? I 'm sheriff Dan masset . 
I have some information about your missing person . Come in . Sit down . 
I 'm just down from Montgomery county , New York . Upstate . 
Look familiar ? 
Is this Alexi ? 
He 's my son . His name is Alexander . 
His uncle started calling him " Alexi " when the kid took a shine to ice hockey . 
Were you aware that your son was here in Philadelphia ? No , ma 'am . 
No ? 
His mom died five years ago , and things between us went downhill . 
I , buried myself in work , and the kid 's uncle Jerry , my wife 's brother ... You know , started putting thoughts in the kid 's head about having a future in hockey . 
It 's all he talked about . 
Apparently he 's got talent . I couldn 't say . 
But what I can tell you is that Jerry is a cheat and a liar , and I tried to warn Alex that he was gassing him up , but the kid didn 't wanna listen to me . Of course , right ? 
- Yeah . - I didn 't want to fight , so I just I let them go . 
You know , I figured that sooner or later , Jerry 's true colors would come through , and Alex would come home to me . 
You probably don 't think I 'm too much of a father ? 
I think being a parent doesn 't come with instructions . 
Soon as I saw your alert , I came down here . 
So , can you tell me anything ? You got any leads ? 
Well , respectfully , sheriff , I will update you as soon as we have anything concrete . 
This is my son we 're talking about . Until then ... 
I understand , okay ? Completely . 
But my team 's on top of it . 
Actually ... Your son was using the last name " zinman . " 
Does that ... Does that mean anything to you ? 
No . But his uncle Jerry 's last name , my wife 's maiden , was " rimbaud . " 
That 's " - b-a-u-d . " 
- Okay . - See what that gets you . 
Well , thank you , and I appreciate your Patience . 
I will contact you as soon as I hear anything . Okay ? 
Alex is a really good kid . His uncle just put some crazy thoughts in his head . 
We 'll find your son . 
You get anything , you call me . Please . Of course . 
All right , so Jerry rimbaud falls off the map three years ago , about the same time Alexi joins his hockey league . 
Yeah , well , the sheriff said that he wasn 't the most upstanding citizen . 
Maybe he got them into some kind of a jam ? 
Yeah , maybe , but still , no matter what he was doing , he 's gotta be invested in this kid 's future . 
What do you think ? Sports parent smelling a payday ? Maybe . 
Either way , you still gotta believe in the kid . 
Hurry up ! You know why you lost ? You lost because we got careless . 
We got careless because we got tired . 
Weak passes , giveaways , flybys , no back check , not covering the point . 
It all comes down to conditioning . Back on the line . We 're going again . Actually , coach ... coach ? Tryin ' to work here . 
We 're trying to work too . We 're with the Philadelphia police department . 
What 's this about ? We need to speak to one of your players . 
I mean , they kind of look like they could use a break . 
Their time would be better spent improving their game . 
You can wait . 
No ! That 's not gonna happen . 
There 's a kid missing . Anyway . 
Ed ! Where 's ed ? 
Scrappy kid from the other night . Got into a fight during the game . 
Edward ? Eddie ? No ? 
All right , look , you can talk to us , or you can keep doing sprints and then talk to us . 
Is ed here or no ? 
Apparently , I am not Spartacus . 
Thanks , coach . Just be a minute . 
Back on the line ! We 're goin ' again ! 
We just want to know about Alexi the kid you fought on the bullfrogs the other night . 
What do you want to know ? - How well do you know him ? - We used to be teammates before I was traded to the dragons . 
League moves us around sometimes . 
Well , according to the stats sheet , you were number two behind Alexi . That upset you ? Why should it ? 
Well , you both wanted the same thing , and it looks like he was gonna get it . 
We 're friends , okay ? 
Then why 'd you fight ? 
I mean , I know it 's part of the game , but , I mean ... Asked around , he 's not much of a fighter , so it 's kinda on you , no ? 
Just trying to help him , buddy . Come on . 
We fought ' cause he asked me to . 
- Come again ? - He said he was gonna hit me , and I better hit him back . 
I didn 't think he was serious , but then he dropped the gloves , so I did too , and then they split us up , and ... he was gone . 
Well , he ever say why ? 
Have you spoken to him since ? 
He was waiting for me before practice , said he needed some money , and couldn 't go home . What , to his uncle ? Okay . 
Did he say where he was going , by any chance ? No ? 
You know where him and his uncle stay ? Yeah . 
That 's blood . 
On me . 
It 's the uncle . 
Shot twice . 
All right . 
Two shots to the chest . Whoever did this knew he was dead . 
Somebody else came in here , checked his pulse , made these footprints . 
Shooter 's still out there . Alexi might be the next target . Great . 
I 'll call homicide . 
Captain . 
Inspector . 
I thought our meeting wasn 't until later . 
Well , I just got looped in by homicide on the dead body that your men found . 
The time of death was about 9 : 00 A.M. in the morning , which would 've meant that your missing person was still with his team . 
So Alexi isn 't the shooter . He just found the body and ran . 
I 'll have ballistics sent to your desk . 
You let me know if there 's anything else you need . Thank you . Inspector , that 's not why . I , I scheduled a time with you . 
It 's about the Logan barlowe case . 
The car bombing ? What about it ? 
Well , it 's more about Logan barlowe 's confession . There are some concerns . 
Exactly whose concerns are we talking about ? 
It 's not mine , the man who took his statement . It 's not the district attorney 's , who signed off . 
Is it yours ? 
Well , it 's out of respect to both you and the D.A. That I wanted to make you aware of my concerns . 
I see . You 're trying to control the narrative , is that it ? I wouldn 't say that . 
Well , captain , here 's the only narrative you need to be focused on . Your commanding officer , that 's me , is giving you a direct order to drop it . 
The Logan barlowe bombing case is miles outside of your purview at the mp ... 
Stay away from it . 
Why you wanna help me ? 
Logan barlowe , there 's two things I know about you . 
One , you 're an expert with explosives , and , two , you 're gonna be in here for a very long time . 
So , I need something . You help me out , I can , I can help you . 
I can talk to the warden . Anyway ... 
I served overseas in Afghanistan , and while I was there , I came across a bomber who was a ... A bad guy , a scumbag , used kids as triggers , that kinda thing . 
And now I have reason to believe that he 's here , in the states . 
Show you some photos . This is ... 
An explosion at a Boston boatyard . Both of these and these three are from a ... A garage in New York just last week . 
Now , I think that my guy had motive to do both of these , but what I can 't prove is that the same guy built both of these bombs , so that 's what I 'm asking you to help me out with . 
Guy knows his stuff . 
Detonator in this photo could 've caused this blast pattern . 
What 'd he use , c-4 ? Semtex ? 
Y-Y-You can 't tell from looking at these photos ? 
I 'd be guessing . 
Where 'd he plant the bomb in relation to the driver ? 
You know , I 'm really not much of a car guy , but y-you can 't tell from looking at these make or model ? 
Look , man , I 'm tryin ' to help , but how in the hell you expect me to know if you don 't ? 
Because all of these photos are from the car bombing that you 've already confessed to . 
Explain that . 
What the hell 's goin ' on here ? 
I don 't know . I-i ... you tell me . 
I mean , who put you up to this ? You 're crazy . 
I 'm not crazy . I 've seen your rap sheet . Okay ? 
You 're connected to a lot of car bombs , but zero dead bodies , and , unfortunately , you don 't have long to live . All right ? 
I mean , you 're not the guy you hire for this job . You 're the guy that you hire to take the fall for this job . 
So tell me , please , who paid your insurance policy ? That 's all I want to know . 
We 're done here . 
Enjoy your stay , Logan . 
What do you got on Alexi 's uncle ? 
Very little . 
Just confirmation that Alexi 's mother , who died five years ago , is Jerry 's sister . 
All right , what about the financials ? He maxed out a few credit cards at a supermarket , but they were all for gift cards . You know , ride shares , food delivery apps , a few pre-loaded debit cards . 
So that anybody on his trail wouldn 't be able to track him . Exactly . Sheriff masset said that Jerry had enemies . 
Sure looks like he 's trying to stay off the grid . 
Well , Alexi has no phone , and there 's zero social media on the uncle . 
Now , his phone is shut down , but I was able to get the cell provider to connect me to his app accounts . I was just about to start digging . 
I mean , these guys were broke , so it 's likely just gonna be food and essentials . 
What about his teammates ? 
Eavesdrop much ? 
We questioned the teammates already . 
They don 't know anything . You should check their socials . 
The uncle might be off the grid , but no one my age is . 
Check the filter hashtag : " Bullfrogs . " 
The bullfrogs ' social page . 
Well , lookie here . 
There 's Alexi . The team 's out celebrating a win . Yeah . Hang on . 
This photo here , it 's a different date , but it looks like the same place . 
Wait , wait , wait , wait ! Zoom in on that . 
That 's Charlie mcgannon 's bar . The Irish mob ? 
A-As in Nikki 's old c.I. ? 
Nice work . 
Now get your butt down here . 
We would 've been happy to come to you , Charlie . 
No , I don 't love it when cops come by . No ? I 'm always enjoying seeing you , though , Nikki . 
What 's with the chaperone ? 
I have a case . 
And it 's got nothing to do with your primary income . 
I 'm intrigued . 
You , know the name Jerry zinman ? 
He 's got a nephew named Alexi . Plays on a hockey team that you seem to have hosted a number of times . 
Yeah , the bullfrogs , sure . Yeah . 
Alexi , now , that guy he 's more of a hockey prodigy . 
I dabble in sports representation . 
Yeah . I 'm gonna sign that kid soon as he turns 18 . 
So you 're , interested in his uncle ? 
What 'd he do ? 
He was killed this morning . Now Alexi 's missing . 
You gotta be kidding me . 
How well did you know him ? 
Well , one of my guys saw that he had some talent , so we kept a close eye on him . 
You know , bought him some new gear , let him eat at my place at a discount . 
Made sure to keep them out of trouble . 
What type of trouble you talking about ? 
Well , nothing locally . 
I had my people put the word out that ... They 're friends of ours . 
Now , you know that if I 'm asking , it 's because we 're worried about Alexi . 
We don 't want anything to happen to him . I 'm guessing you don 't either . 
You know what happened to his mom ? Yeah , she passed away five years ago . 
So you don 't know . 
I 'd look into it if I was you , sergeant . But you didn 't hear that from me . 
See ya , Nikki . 
Charlie 's a lot of things , but wrong isn 't one of them . 
Check this out . 
The coroner 's file for Alexi 's mother . 
Blunt trauma as the result of a fall . 
Ruled " accidental . " The lead investigator was sheriff masset ? Her own husband ? 
Well , that 's inappropriate . 
I-I mean , you would pass it to a deputy . Maybe even call in the staties . Assuming you wanted to do it above board . 
36 hours from the time of death to the coroner 's ruling is lightning speed , even for an open-and-shut case . 
Well , I compiled game footage from the league , but I also canvassed the parents for any of their footage , and ... It 's almost like he stopped , for some reason . 
Okay . 
And then I found , this angle from a smartphone camera . 
What is he looking at ? I was wondering that too , so I matched the time stamp with footage that was taken on the other side of the arena , and ... 
That 's sheriff masset . He was at the game . 
He told me that our alert brought him here to Philly . He lied right to my face . 
Alexi saw him , picked a fight , then used the chaos to disappear . 
He 's running from his own father . 
Hey . Have you found Alexi yet ? 
No , not yet , but we will . 
And your tip gave us a solid lead . Thank you very much , detective . 
Maya , this is wonderful . 
May I ? 
Yeah . My gosh . This is amazing ! How long have you been drawing ? 
After you guys found me , I started seeing this therapist , and I didn 't really like talking about myself or what happened , so ... The doc suggested I find different ways of expressing myself , and I 've always liked doodling . 
I mean , this goes way beyond doodling . You are very talented ! 
What a way to find out you 're good at something ? 
Listen , I gotta go check in with Nikki , but , some of the guys ordered some pizza . You hungry ? 
- Hell , yeah ! - Yeah . 
Sheriff masset turned his cell off , and the hotel says that he hasn 't been back in hours . 
Well , Helen ran ballistics on the slug they pulled out of Alexi 's uncle against masset 's service weapon , and it is not a match . 
Well , he could easily have a backup weapon . 
I mean , you like him that much for the murder ? 
Masset lied about why he 's here , and his own son is scared of him . Okay ? That is the only theory that makes sense . 
And if he covered up that investigation five years ago , then who could Alexi go to for help ? 
It makes sense that he 'd run . Exactly . 
What 's up with you ? 
Sorry . 
It 's Maya . I ... I wasn 't naive enough to think that sending her home would fix everything , but , I don 't know , I assumed that I assumed that she 'd be off the streets a while . You know ? 
So things are still bad with her parents ? No , this time , it 's her boarding school . 
Yeah . Right . 
Maya is ... I don 't know , she 's sharp . 
- Yeah ? - She has talent . You know ? But if she stays on this path and gets expelled , her entire future will be over before it can start , and Nikki , I genuinely want to help her , but there is only so much I can do , even as a cop . 
Well , you know , maybe it 's not detective adebayo she needs help from . 
Hold on . 
Captain Batista . 
Your people are looking for me . I need you to stop . 
You 're gonna need to be a little more specific than that . 
It 's Alexi . 
I saw the alert . Leave me alone ! 
I 'm fine . 
Yeah ? I 'll run a trace . 
You know , I 'm afraid that we can 't do that , Alexi . I , why don 't you just come in and we can talk ? 
Okay ? Just tell me where you are . 
You know , you 're not in any trouble . 
You have my word . 
Is my father with you ? No . No , he 's not . 
Alexi , do you believe that your father means you harm ? 
I can keep you safe . 
He 's my problem . 
I 'll deal with it . Hello ? 
All right ! Let 's go . 
Okay . Please tell me you got something , kemi ! 
I got a lock on the number . Pulling the address right now . 
Get patrol up there immediately , then call Jason and Mike . 
How was I not clear enough ? Inspector ... And why the hell did Jason Grant interview Logan barlowe ? 
Well , like I explained before , and as I explained , this case is closed . 
I gave you a direct order to back off ! 
You think I was joking ? I think that you 're avoiding the truth . Here 's the truth . 
I 'm gonna write you and Grant up for insubordination . You leave Jay out of it . 
I am captain . It was my decision . 
Don 't play the righteous card with me . 
Grant was out of pocket long before this . 
My mistake was believing he was an outlier ! And where do you get off with all this entitlement ? 
The man sitting in that prison did not blow up maritz and his lawyer ! 
That should be more important to you than your ego . 
You 're on thin ice , Nikki . 
You watch how you speak to me ! Don 't you threaten me ! You come after my career or Jason 's , I will have the press so far up your ass , you 'll cough up a microphone . 
What happens next is on you . 
Remember that . 
I mean , this is history . 
I mean , is this not epic ? 
Don 't touch anything . Please . You guys want to sit , have a drink , or something ? 
No , we 're okay . Thank you very much . 
I just want to make it clear . 
Alexi did not break into my house . 
All right , well , we traced the call , it came from here . 
Maybe so . But Alexi was welcome here . 
Had his own combo for my digital door lock . 
Moose , my dog , knows him . 
He didn 't break in . 
We understand that you don 't want Alexi to be in any trouble . The problem is , he 's already in trouble . We need to find him . I don 't know where he is . 
Why 'd he have a code to your house ? 
My door 's always open to my players , especially the ones that need a meal , a place to crash from time to time . 
I grew up poor too . 
These prep school kids have advantages kids like me and Alexi had to overcome with talent and hard work . 
Nothing 's come easy for that boy . 
You find him , you bring him in safely . 
You know what kind of trouble he was in ? Can 't say that I do . 
Can I ask you what 's bothering you , then , right now ? 
My gun is missing . 
So Alexi 's armed now ? 
Look , you gotta find him before he does something he can 't take back . Right . 
Thank you . Come on . 
All right , so , after tracing Alexi 's phone call back to bud 's place , I searched for any additional calls that he might have made after he called us , and there was one . 
He made a call to a 518 number . 
That 's upstate New York . Try it . Yep . All right ... 
Sheriff 's department . 
This is captain Nikki Batista from Philadelphia police mp ... 
Who am I speaking with ? 
Deputy ward . How can I help you ? 
Deputy , were you working at about 6 : 00 P.M. this evening ? 
Been here a lot longer than that . 
Did you receive a call just after 6 : 00 ? 
I did , now that you mention it . Took a message for the sheriff that didn 't make a ton of sense . What was the message ? 
What 's this all about ? 
Deputy , this is detective adebayo . 
I 've just emailed your office the captain 's badge and the case file of our open investigation , so consider your ass covered . 
We really need to know what that message was . Okay . " Sheriff . 9 : 00 P.M. where you last saw me . " That mean anything to you ? Yeah , it might . 
Thank you , deputy . All right . 
Jason ? Yeah . Alexi left a message for his father to meet him at 9 : 00 P.M. where he last saw him . 
It 's quarter-to right now . 
The last place he saw him was at the game . He 's trying to get him to come to the arena . 
All right , we 're not far . We 'll head there now . 
Nik , we got reason to believe that Alexi 's armed . 
Look , Alexi blames the sheriff for his mother 's death , and he probably thinks that he killed his uncle too . 
He called him out . Y-You guys better hurry . 
All right . Do me a favor . Have patrol set up a perimeter two blocks around the arena . 
No one gets in , no one gets out . 
No lights , no ... no sirens , no nothing . 
Okay ? We don 't want a hostage situation to pop off . Tell ' em to be quiet . 
We 're on it . We 're on it . 
This is captain Batista . 
I got your message . I 'm here like you asked . 
I miss you , kid ! 
Things haven 't been the same since your uncle took you away from me . 
I read about your team in the paper how good you 're doing , and how you 're a big reason why . 
I 'm proud of you , Alex . It 's Alexi ... and you need to stop lying . Okay , okay . 
You just calm down , Alexi . Be careful with that , son . 
Now , I-I know things have been hard since your mom passed . 
I know what you did ! 
Now , see , I knew your uncle would lie to you about what happened that night . You listen to me . Your mom , she 'd been drinking , and she took a bad step near the basement . 
You-you remember how loose that-that banister was ? 
And she fell and she hit her head . Yes . It was tragic . But you know what hurts me even more is that your uncle Jerry turned my own son against me . 
No , no ! You 're the one who 's got it wrong ! 
I asked Jerry to get me away from you ! 
Why would you do that ? 
Because I was there ! 
Practice got canceled . I came home early . I saw you fighting , I saw her slip down the stairs , and I know it didn 't kill her ! 
She was still screaming for help when you killed her ! 
Okay , listen , you 're making a big mistake , kid . Just calm down . 
Yeah ? You killed her ! 
You found uncle Jerry , and you killed him too ! 
You get Alexi . I 'll flank the sheriff . 
What now , dad ? 
Am I next ? 
That 's up to you . 
Can you be smart about this ? 
Philly pd ! 
Put down the weapon ! 
Alexi ! 
Drop it . 
Put it on the ground . 
Good , now kick it away . 
Turn around . On your knees . Hands behind your head . Get on the ground . 
Welcome to Philly , bitch . 
Alexi ? I know why you ran , but you gotta stop running now . It 's over , all right ? 
Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Put the gun down . Put the gun down . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I am a cop . 
So is he ! How do I know you 're not working for him ? 
I 'm not working for him . Okay ? He tried to shoot at me . 
I am a cop . 
Put the gun down . 
He tried to shoot me ! Okay , good point . Good point . You and I are both gonna put our guns down right now , and we 're gonna have a conversation . That 's the only way this works , okay ? 
Down . Put the gun down . Put the gun ... good . Good . Now , listen to me . Okay ? Listen to me . 
Look at me , Alexi . Okay ? You 're not in trouble . 
Nothing you did today is something you can 't come back from . 
But if you do something stupid right now , if you continue with this , you 're throwing your life away . 
What have I got left ? 
All right , you got a future . 
Okay ? You got people who believe in you . 
Your uncle , he believed in you . Bud , he believes in you . 
I think deep down , you believe in yourself , but you gotta put the gun down and stop . Put the gun on the bench . 
Alexi , look at me . Put the gun down on the bench right now . 
It 's over . 
Good . 
I put my gun away . 
It 's over , all right ? Come on . 
It 's over . - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - All right . All right . All right . You 're okay . All right ? Hey , hey , hey . 
You 're okay . No one 's gonna hurt you anymore , okay ? 
You 're all right . Come on . 
Ballistics are in from masset 's backup piece you took off him . They match the slugs from Jerry 's murder . 
Well , looks like the sheriff 's gonna catch the murder charge he deserves , and Alexi 's not even gonna have to testify . 
I just wonder where he goes from here . 
Well , I made a call to social services . 
They signed off on temporary custody , as long as there 's bi-weekly check-ins . 
Wait . Custody with who ? 
They said you could stay with me . 
- You serious ? - Yes . It 's all good . Okay ? Let 's get out of here . 
Tell me that doesn 't warm your heart just a little bit ? Yeah , it does . 
It 's just , we have another problem . 
That 's my office line . 
Can you catch me up in a second ? 
- Yeah . - Yeah . Go . 
What 's the coffee for ? Us . We have a long drive back to sacred academy . 
Maya , baby girl . I can sympathize with a lot of things ... Unloving parents , bigotry , check , check . But being a quitter ? No . 
Look , you don 't get to choose how people treat you . You do get to choose if that treatment defines who you are or not ... And you should never , ever give someone that power over you . 
After everything I 've been through , I don 't even know how to define myself . 
You know , when I was your age , I had my own trauma , and , yeah , i-it changed me , but ... 
You know ? It molded me into who I am today . 
And from what I saw in this journal . I think your trauma is a gift to you too . 
I mean , this could be your path to a beautiful life . You just have to work for it . 
I don 't even know where to start . 
Look , if you finish school , I will get you a summer job at my friend 's gallery . 
And , I don 't know , from there , maybe you can apply to art school . 
Can I think about it ? 
I mean , of course , yeah . 
Look . I don 't get a choice . I have to take you back to school . 
But ... You get to decide where to go from there . 
And that 's an amazing thing . 
Come on , we 've got a long drive . Can I call dj ? Fine , but you 're playing my music . 
You got anything from the last five years ? 
I said " music , " Maya . 
I 'm-I 'm very sorry that I put you in this spot . 
Are you ? But I love , love , that you ... 
You put him in his place . Yeah , it felt good , but if I were you , I 'd check in with my union rep . 
I 'm not worried about it . 
The guy is a bureaucratic punk . 
He don 't want war . 
A war that we might have started . 
Hey , what 's up , Mike ? 
You all right ? Yeah , that , phone call ... 
Inspector braun just transferred me out of the mp ... Effective immediately .
