Canary always has food for us . 
My god , I 'm so hungry . 
Yeah . Me too . 
Are you sure she 's working tonight ? 
You hear that applause ? 
Canary 's def in there . Trust . 
Order 's up , kiddos . 
Today , we have " drunk leftovers , " which ... what looks like a bit ... And what looks like orange chicken ? 
Thank you ! They 've really gotta work on their menu at this place . 
How was the show tonight ? It was good . On a scale of wong foo to Priscilla , I 'd give it a birdcage . 
As the great vivien Leigh said " tomorrow is another day . " 
Who 's vivien Leigh ? Gen z . Gotta love ya . Heh ! 
Someone who 's not gen z ... me needs to get out of these heels because my cankles are crowing . 
Bye , my darlings . 
I 'll see you tomorrow , Maya ? 
Yup , I 'll be here . 
Thanks . 
All right , Reggie . 
What did we talk about , all right ? 
We need our elbow in and our eyes on what ? 
The basket ? 
All right , buddy . I love your energy . 
Let 's try to keep this one in one zip code , okay ? 
You got it , coach Mike . 
Okay . Come on ! Who wants pizza ? Hey , hey , hey . Save me a pepperoni , all right ? 
Hey , Mrs. Coach . You 're early . All right ? We gotta practice . We got a game this weekend . 
How 's Reggie gonna go pro if he 's stuffing his face with pepperoni pizza ? 
The pies were hot , and your all-stars don 't seem to mind . 
One second . 
Hey , we got extra , if you want a slice ? 
I need help . Yeah . What can I do you for ? 
It 's not for me . It 's for my friend . 
You wanna tell me about your friend ? 
Her name 's Maya . I haven 't seen her in , like , two days , and I asked around and nobody 's seen her . 
Come here . 
If she 's in trouble , then ... We-we can help . 
We just need to know some things . What is Maya 's last name ? 
I don 't know it . What about her parents ? 
Don 't know them , either . 
You know where she lives ? We don 't ... We don 't have homes like , normal homes . 
What 's your name , baby ? - Jax . 
- You want to tell me the last place you saw Maya ? - Yeah . - Let 's get you some food . 
- Thanks . - Come here , baby . 
Actually , I know this place . I was here once , I got a burger 
I was on a stakeout , and it felt like a-a buick was stuck in my colon . 
All right , all right ! You thought we needed to know that ? 
Gut health is very important , Michael . Okay ? Even for somebody your age . 
Y-You don 't have to worry about it yet , though . 
You and Maya come here often ? 
Yeah . The queens here are really nice . 
Queens ? Drag queens ? 
Some of them will sneak food for us when they can , and then we 'll snatch makeup for them when we can 
I probably shouldn 't have just told a cop that . - It 's fine . - No , you 're under arrest . - What ? 
- I 'm k ... I 'm kidding . It 's out of our jurisdiction . Stolen makeup ... you 're fine . Did somebody give you guys food the other night ? Yeah . My girl , canary . 
All right , well , maybe she knows something . 
She usually shows up around lunchtime . Lunchtime ? Okay , um ... here . Go ... Go get yourself something to eat ... not here . - Thanks . - Thank you very much . Don 't buy drugs ! 
All right , what do we do ? Just wait here ? Ooh-ee ! Nice ass , daddy . 
Why you ? I mean , I got a nice ass , don 't I ? 
Have you seen your ass ? 
I 'll let you answer that question yourself . 
Let 's go wait in the car . 
I have a fantastic ass . 
Heads up . 
Miss canary ? 
I guess that depends on who 's asking . 
The precinct holding a beauty pageant today ? No . We 're looking for a homeless girl ... Maya . Yeah , I know Maya . 
I do give her food every now and then , but I don 't know if the food from here is a blessing or a curse . 
Yeah , no , I feel you on that ! Do you know where she is ? 
I don 't , but is she in trouble , or ... ? 
She might be . Okay . That explains it . You know , I actually found her bag when I was coming home from the club the other night . 
I actually grabbed it , thinking that I would just give it to her the next time I saw her . - You mind grabbing it for me ? 
- Not at all , cutie as long as you hold my war paint . 
I mean , what ... w-what is it ? " Cutie " now ? I mean , y-you 're like catnip around here . 
All right , all right , all right . 
Thank you . 
This bag is probably all she had . 
There 's no way she left it on a sidewalk . 
Just a child . 
A little girl ... Living out of a backpack . 
I mean , what kind of world allows that , Nik ? 
And where were her parents ? 
" Family " doesn 't always mean what you think it does . 
It 's not a good sign . 
What do you think ? Drug problems ? 
Well , she wouldn 't be the first girl to get lost at the bottom of a baggie . 
Well , someone seems to care about Maya . 
" Glenolden girls ' soccer camp . " 
Find that camp . 
I want the name of both those girls right now . 
Hey , Nik . 
You , you wore jeans to our wedding . Feet off my desk ! - Yes , ma 'am . - And it was spontaneous , okay ? I didn 't exactly have time to shop . 
You actually listened to me ? 
I 'm afraid of the next 60 seconds . 
Don 't be . 
I did a thing . 
I looked into the John maritz murder , even though you may have told me not to . 
Are we doing this again ? It was a car bomb . It is with homicide now . 
I asked you to stand down . 
W-Would it help if I said I was sorry ? You 're not sorry . I know you . - Okay , fair . 
- Fine . You already closed the door , so you might as well tell me what you found . 
I found nothing . Okay ? It 's just the pd portal . I looked at the file and a-a virus nuked me . 
What do you mean ? 
It was white-listed . 
" White-listed " ? 
You can 't update your phone software . How do you even ... 
Wayne ? Of course . Wayne . Okay , okay , okay , look . Nik , the point is ... it was white-listed . Okay ? Is that a coincidence ? 
Tell me , who has the authority to do something like that ? 
Someone who has something to hide , someone who may or may not have a personal beef with me . 
Do you want to buy a vowel ? Should I keep going ? 
- Stop it ! - Okay , let 's skip to the end 
Hollis braun . Your new buddy . He isn 't my buddy , okay ? 
And-and you can 't just level accusations against an inspector like that . 
Why not ? 
- Hey ... - What 's up ? 
- This is weird , but I just got a message from braun 's office saying that he wanted to set up a lunch with me . You want a recommendation ? The olive garden 's bread sticks are 
I mean , they are phenomenal . W-Why does he want to have lunch with you ? 
Sorry , that ... that came out wrong . 
Yeah , just a little bit . Hey , Nikki ? I got those I.D.S. Okay . 
All right , so ... The summer camp identified those girls . 
The one on the left is our girl , " Maya " except the camp had her registered under a different name . " Hannah Marie sutter . " 
And she 's from cherry hill , New Jersey . 
So what 's she doing in Philly ? 
I don 't know , but she 's ours now , and a runaway doesn 't leave her bag unless someone makes her . 
Issue the alert . 
All right . 
Hello ? 
Can anyone hear me ? Hello ? 
Is anyone ... 
Please , let me out of here ! I can 't ... 
Somebody , please , let me out of here ! 
So she made it all the way to Philly this time ? 
Well , we called the New Jersey state police . They have two prior missing reports in their system for Maya ... " Hannah . " 
What 's your point ? 
We 're trying to understand why you didn 't report your daughter missing . 
She ran away five years ago . She ran away two years ago . 
Right . Just to be clear ... because clarity is important you didn 't report her most recent departure to any of the appropriate authorities ? 
Our daughter would rather live on the streets than at home with us . 
Do you know what that 's like ? I work . 
My husband works . We have two other children who are both normal and easy . 
Tell us what to do . 
People prey on runaways , and there 's nothing we can do to stop them unless we are notified . 
You 're calling us bad parents . They 're calling us bad parents ! 
Mrs. Sutter , I-I am not calling you we just can 't communicate with Hannah . 
Believe us , we 've tried . 
What do you expect us to do ? 
You can try and learn . 
She loves soccer , yet , she comes home talking about a-a girlfriend who lives in Philly , wanting to go live with her wanting us to call her " Maya , " and then she ran away ... 
Again . So , we figure , she 'll come home when she 's tired of making a spectacle of herself . 
Mr. and Mrs. Sutter ... Your other children may be " easy , " but that doesn 't mean that Maya isn 't " normal . " 
And the only lesson that she needs to learn is to stop hoping that her parents will start acting like parents . Kemi . Kemi , and if you 'll excuse me ... I have a child to find . My apologies . 
Would you give us a moment , please ? Yeah . 
I 'm sorry . 
That was unprofessional . 
But those people in there I know that look in their eyes , I have seen it in my parents ' . 
It is plain and simple indifference . 
It is not our job to judge . 
It is our job to find their daughter . 
I know that ! But their daughter is in danger , and they didn 't even report it . 
Let me handle them , okay ? 
You track down the girl from the photos , the one from the soccer camp ... the girlfriend . 
Captain ! We have a hit on the alert from the city youth shelter . - I 'm sorry . 
- It 's okay . 
Close to a quarter of the country 's unhoused population is under 18 . 
- I 'm sure you know that . - Yeah . 
Right here , in Philadelphia alone , there 's 1,700 children living on the streets . 
She 's stayed here before ... But two nights ago , when checked in for the 7 P.M. curfew , we didn 't have any beds available . Well , maybe she went to another shelter . 
There 's three youth shelters , but that 's only 40 beds total . 
I-If there 's just no beds , what , she just ends up on the street ? 
Welcome to my sleepless nights . 
Find her , sergeant . 
With no roof over their heads ... These kids don 't last long . 
Hey . 
How you doing ? 
Am I busted ? 
No , no , you 're gonna be okay this time . 
Um , we-we 're gonna flush that down the toilet , and then you 're gonna tell me where you got it . 
Yeah ... It 's-it 's a local dealer . Guy named " skit . " 
Just , you-you text him , he gives a meet-up point usually around 13th street , in-in the " gayborhood . " 
- Okay . - You said 13th street ? 
Yeah . That 's a block away from where Maya went missing . 
Okay , so , why don 't you run off and , flush that down the toilet , then you 're gonna text skit , and we 're gonna set up a meet for us . 
This girl 's younger than sid , man . 
I don 't like her chances if we don 't find her . 
Well , street kids do a lot of things to survive . 
You know , maybe she owed the wrong guy , offered the wrong thing , got in over her head ? 
Whatever it is , hopefully , this dealer can help us . 
What kind of a name is " skit " anyway ? I don 't know . His parents must 've hated him . He sells drugs to kids . I 'm not much of a fan either ... Cutie . All right . Hold on . 
You know , it just occurred to me ... 
Well , I mean , this-this ... this dealer kid , he thinks that the kid who texted him is coming to see him , not two grown men who look ... Like how you look . 
What 's wrong with the way I look ? 
You look like a cop . 
He 's gonna see you comin ' from a mile away . 
- You look like a cop , too ! - No , I don 't . You 're outta your mind . This is the " sexy mechanic " look . 
' Kay ? Chicks dig it . 
And , y-you know , you ... You got something different going on . Yeah . 
What do you think ? 
No . No . No . Absolutely not . No . 
It 'd look so good on you ! Come on . Come on . 
It 's fine . I don 't know why I listened to you . 
You look really good ! Nikki 's going to like it . It really shows off your physique . 
I look like brown fonzie . 
You look great ! Hey , look , don 't be so selfish . 
All right ? We 're trying to find a kid . 
And , you know what , the truth is , you 're gonna find a lot , um , uses ... for this thing . 
- Yeah ? Where exactly ? - I don 't know . A midnight showing of Saturday night fever ? 
You know what ? It 's actually not that bad . 
Very good , very good , very good . 
When you 're done admiring yourself , I think I see ... Skit . 
Skit ? 
Yeah , no chance . 
Keep walkin ' , officers . 
Was it that obvious ? 
You look like a high school football coach and your buddy here looks like he just lost a George Michael costume contest , so , yeah ... A little obvious . 
We 're gonna have a little chit-chat after this . - That 's fair . - And I know my rights . Okay ? You texted me from a phone that wasn 't yours that 's entrapment . 
I don 't care ... about any of that . 
I 'm looking for a girl ... a client of yours . 
Wanna help us out , and maybe we don 't arrest you ... for now ? 
I knew it . 
Go get ' em , George Michael ! You got this ! 
Was it worth it ? 
Now you 're under arrest . 
Thanks for the assist . 
Anytime ! 
Love the jacket . Hey ! You hear that ? 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Thanks . 
Thank you , everyone . Thank you ! 
We 're looking for Maya . 
I don 't have to talk to you . 
That 's true , but you also had six grams of coke , 30 oxy , and a dozen ecstasy pills on you when we busted you , so ... 
What are you doing ? Are you supplying Coachella this year ? 
You want to talk to us , or you want to talk to the judge at your arraignment ? Your choice . 
Fine . Maya bought from me , but it 's not what you think . 
She came to me once in awhile for zannies . 
Do you know , was she getting high ? Or did she actually have anxiety , or ... 
Do you know how hard it is to get mental health meds when you live on the streets ? 
When 's the last time you saw her ? 
Couple days ago . 
She needed meds , she didn 't have enough cash , and I don 't do charity , so . 
She said she had some kinda under-the-table gig she 'd get the money , and come back , but she never showed up . What , she worked somewhere local ? Where ? 
Hey . Got your attention now ? Good . She didn 't tell me , okay ? 
Probably somewhere in the gayborhood , but that 's all I know . Caitlyn ? Hi . I 'm detective adebayo . 
Can you sit for a minute ? 
I need to talk to you about Maya ... Hannah . 
We have , reason to believe that she 's in ... She 's in danger . 
I ... don 't know anything ... about sweetie . I 'm a friend . I 'm trying to help . I want Maya safe . 
And if these photos are telling the truth , I think you do , too . 
Look . I can call your parents and have them take you down to the station for an official interview , or we can talk here . Yeah ? 
Okay , um , so you met Maya at soccer camp , over the summer ... why don 't you start there ? 
I was nervous about going to camp because I 'm not great in new situations , but meeting Maya the first time she has anxiety issues , she got me . 
Everything just felt right , you know ? Yeah . I do ! 
I mean , you meet the right person and it just feels like you 're breathing air that you never breathed before . 
Did it feel like that ? 
- Yeah ? - Yeah ! - Yeah . 
That was the freest I-I ever felt . 
We called each other " Teddy bear , " so I bought her a stuffed animal . So silly . 
I 'm not out at home like Maya was . 
I wasn 't ready to be someone new with my family , and then , a couple weeks ago , 
Maya shows up at my door , asking to stay with me . She didn 't know that I wasn 't out at home . 
So , um ... What did you do then ? 
I told her to leave . 
Did she mention anyone harassing her , or trying to take advantage , in any way ? 
No . No , nothing like that . 
A couple weeks ago , I got to school , and there was a note in my locker . 
She must 've snuck in . 
She said that she 'd be in the city and that she 'd stay close . 
I need to see that note . 
Do you still have it ? 
I 'll make sure that this gets back to you . 
Are you gonna find her ? 
I hope so . 
Will you tell her that I miss her ? 
It 'll be the first thing that I do . 
So we have a girl with mental health issues that got rejected . 
Possible suicide , possible predators I don 't ... 
I don 't love it . The girlfriend can 't place her , and that was about three days ago , - so we 're running out of time . - All right . 
So , what do we know about the hours before she disappeared ? 
Well , we know she saw her dealer . 
6 : 00 , right ? 
Then she got turned away from the youth center , 7 P.M. 
Um , the next thing we know ... Is that she was with the boy outside the drag bar at , say , 10 P.M. to close , at midnight . And then , gone . 
All right , so the big piece that 's missing is between 7 and 10 P.M. 
What about the drug dealer kid ? He said that she picked up work somewhere in the gayborhood . 
Question is where ? Wait a minute . 
The note that she gave to Caitlyn . Let 's see . Um , it was on a napkin from ... This place 
" the gin fizz . " 
Who the hell let a 15-year-old inside of a bar ? 
Either she 's got the Mona Lisa of fake I.D.S and she likes their appletinis , or she was not going there for a drink , she was working there ... that 's where she was working . 
Can I get you officers a drink ? 
Yeah , I 'm gonna have this whole bottle . 
We 're on duty . Thanks . 
David 'll be off the phone in just a second , fellas . 
You work here long ? 
I haven 't missed a day in three years . 
David hired me ' cause the circuit boys can 't get free drinks off a straight bartender . 
That 's a good business plan . You must 've seen it all ? 
Yeah , wild times . The sex got safer and the drugs got weirder . 
Let me ask you a question . You , um , you ever come across fake I.D.S here ? 
Anybody like ... Her , for example ? 
I ... Yeah , think you guys should talk to the boss . 
Sorry about that . 
What can I do for the pd today ? 
I do have a thing with the city about parking spots , but other than that ... clean as the driven snow . No , it 's not that . We 're looking for this girl . Who ? 
Maya ? - You know her ? 
- Sure , I know her . 
Okay , why-why is there a 15-year-old in your bar ? 
There are so many homeless kids in this neighborhood . 
It breaks my heart . 
I don 't let them near the booze . I just slip them cash to help with the dishes , take out the trash ... that kinda thing . Right . 
Was she here , two nights ago ? 
Yeah , a couple hours ' worth . 
She was motivated . Hustled . 
I don 't think I 've ever seen the glasses shine so bright . 
You know , it 's about time someone from the city gave a crap . 
What do you mean ? 
Do you have any idea how many kids go missing from here ? 
Come through , disappear , vanish ... like they never existed . No one comes around here asking . Well ... we 're asking now . 
Well , it 's about damn time . 
Hey , inspector . What 's up ? Well , you couldn 't make lunch , so I thought I 'd just drop by . 
Yeah , well , we 're full-court press for the missing kid , so , um ... but come in , have a seat . 
I 'm a flat-white guy , myself . But you ? Double-Americano . This is great . 
Thank you . 
Um , I read your file and I 'm impressed . 
Thanks . You always wanted to be a cop ? 
No , it turns out that the Phillies were all set at left field , so I went with my backup plan . You ? 
My father was a cop . 
Never made it out of uniform . 
My mother used to say that he loved the badge and he loved the bottle , and they both hated him back . I know the type . 
Yeah . All me and my little brother ever wanted was to impress the bastard . 
Now my brother owns nine charter schools and my badge says " inspector " on it , which wasn 't easy , carrying the old man 's name around like an albatross . 
Irony is , he died of cirrhosis before he could see it . 
I 'm sorry about that . 
Anyway , a long-winded way of me saying that whatever it is that is driving you , this is the sweet spot of your career where everything you touch can turn to gold long as nobody else 's tarnish rubs off . 
Jason Grant 's a good cop . 
I know that Nikki thinks the world of him , but he leaves me ... A little ... concerned . 
Inspector . What brings you up to mpu ? 
Delivering coffee . 
I 'll leave you two to work on the case , but I 'll put a lunch in the books for us all soon . - Sound good ? - Yep . - Yeah ? 
- Yeah . 
Um , kemi wants us in the conference room right away . 
Talk to me , kemi . What do you got ? So we may be looking at a serial offender . 
Um , the bar owner implied that Maya isn 't the first kid to disappear from the gayborhood , so Jason asked me to do some digging . 
No children matching Maya 's general profile came up in our case history , so I expanded the search parameters . 
A lot of these kids don 't come from Philly they just end up here . 
Meaning they were reported missing elsewhere ? Exactly , so ... 
I looked at kids reported missing all over the state um , Pittsburgh , Harrisburg , hers hey ... According to the missing and endangered children 's database , there are 194 children missing in Pennsylvania alone . 
So , I focused on the ones with last-known sightings in Philadelphia which is still a needle in a haystack of needles . 
We gotta narrow it down . Figure out which ones were last seen in the gayborhood . 
Which is why Jason is bringing in someone to ... Consult . 
After you . 
Miss canary , I really appreciate your time . This is my friend , kemi . 
She 's gonna show you some photos . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you too . 
Anything for my girl Maya . 
But you couldn 't have given a girl a chance to change ? 
Basically snatched my tush right off the stage at drag brunch . 
Not that I minded him near my tush ! 
Clock 's always ticking . Welcome to mp ... Well , okay . 
Mind if I , make myself a little bit more comfortable ? Let my hair down ? 
Do your thing . 
There you go ! 
Now , be careful with her . That 's my baby ! 
Okay . 
These three . Are you sure ? Yeah ! 
I see these kids almost every single day , and , girl , I do not forget a face . 
Her . This girl , rosalind okay . And , Joel ... My angel ! 
Joel washed dishes at the bar that I perform at clown car . 
And then this girl , I can 't remember her name , but ... 
Kara with a " k . " I 've seen her once or twice down at gin fizz . - Okay . - I sometimes do a little pop-up there . Gin fizz ? All right . Kemi , will you handle that ? Yeah , I 'm on it . 
Thank you so much . Thank you . 
Thank you , canary . 
Ooh , la , la ! I am . 
Ooh ! Con-drag-ulations , honey . 
You 're gonna look stunning in ivory . - Thank you . - Hmph . 
Just between us girlfriends . I wouldn 't do the floor-length . 
Really ? Why not ? Look at you ! You 've got the calves of a cheetah ! 
Might as well show ' em off . Stop it ! 
How you look is going to dictate who you go to . 
If I were you , I 'd try and look nice . 
Please ! I have ... bad anxiety and I no one in your life wants you , but someone on the other end of that camera will . 
I won 't talk to the cops ! I swear ! Clean up and get some rest . 
Bidding starts in a few hours . Please ... please ... Please ... 
Hey , Nikki ? You 're not gonna believe this . 
What do you got ? The businesses that canary told us about ? 
Remember the bar owner that Mike and Jason talked to ? - David close . 
- Yes . He owns all three . And there 's more ... close has a record . 
30 years ago , he was arrested for unlawful sexual contact with a minor . 
Get Mike and Jason back there . We have a little girl running out of time . 
Find David close . Now . Yeah . 
Tell me again ... ' cause I don 't get it . 
I mean , I got a bunch of missing kids , and you ... you have a record . 
He was my high school boyfriend . I turned 18 , he was still 17 . 
His parents were homophobes . All the charges were dropped eventually . 
I never saw him again . These missing kids I give them cash , I give them work , so they don 't starve to death . I have nothing to hide from you two . Fine . 
I want details . 
I want details when you spoke to them , what they said , where you were ... all of it . 
I don 't have time for this . 
Well , you 're gonna have to make time . All right ? 
We need a list of every single one of your employees that came into contact with the kids . Okay . 
Whatever I have to do to help , but I got nobody on shift right now . 
I got two people from the parameter they 're out of town . I got my bartender , Richard ... he called in sick . 
Whoa-whoa , wait . That 's the bartender from yesterday ? 
Yeah . Richard fredricks . 
He specifically said that he has " never missed a day of work . " - He even made a joke about it . - Yeah . 
Hold on . 
All right , his name is Richard fredricks , and he definitely got squirrelly when we showed him a picture of Maya . All right . I 'm pulling everything up in the system now . 
Okay , here we go . He had an arrest for disorderly conduct eight years ago . 
Home address is ... 
Bridesburg . No other priors . - I don 't know . - Th-this guy looks clean no . Keep looking . 
There 's gotta be something . Okay . Um ... No social media footprint , no liens , no court filings . 
Wait a second . 
I 'm looking at his utility bill . 
He has three separate fiber optic Internet lines going into his house . 
A bartender does not need that much Internet draw . Am I right ? 
He must be uploading and downloading enormous amounts of content . 
Okay , I guarantee , whatever he 's uploading and downloading would make your skin crawl . 
I think I wanna find out and shut this monster down . 
Okay . What exactly are you doing ? 
So I made a phone call to a let 's just say " a friend of a friend , " who gave me access to her Tor browser to get onto the dark web . 
Let me guess ... Wayne . 
Of course . Wayne . 
Okay , hosting a dark web platform is the most likely reason for fredricks ' massive fiber optic situation , so Wayne gave me a source-tracking package , so that I could search out his vpn when I was in here , and ... Got it . I think this is it . 
Nikki , his site is broadcasting live right now . 
My god . It 's Maya . 
That 's what this is all about he 's trafficking her . 
Fredricks ' selling her to the highest bidder . 28 minutes . 
We need to cut this off . Anything we can do ? 
Kemi ? Kemi ? Kemi ... 
Kemi ! I 'll tell you what we can do . We can get his Internet provider on the phone and we can threaten to arrest every person who doesn 't help us cut off his service right this second . 
What the hell ? 
Son of a bitch . 
Please , is it over ? 
Somebody , please ! Help me ! 
Please , is it over ? 
I need my meds ! 
It 's over . 
We 're outta here . 
Where are we going ? 
Where no one will find you . 
I got a business to protect . 
Look who 's the sneaky little bitch . 
I swear to god ... 
Go around back ! 
Somebody ! Please ! Please ! Somebody , help me ! 
Maya ! Back away from the door . This is the police ! 
Get down on the floor , now ! Somebody , help me , please ! 
Hey , hey . You okay ? 
Okay . Hey , I need a paramedic in here , now ! 
Stay down , stay down . All right ? 
That 's what you get for messing with kids . 
You got the right to keep bleeding , homeboy . 
Hey , come on . Come on . 
On your stomach . 
I called the sutters . 
They 're on their way to pick up Maya . 
Those people don 't want her , Nikki , and when you 're not wanted , they aren 't your family . 
We don 't have a choice . No . 
I know this is hard . 
Why don 't you go in there and wait with her ? 
Okay . 
When I was on my own no matter where I had to sleep , no matter who stepped over me I never felt as alone as I did when I was back home . 
No , it 's , just a house . Not my home . 
When I was very young , something happened to me , too . 
I didn 't , I didn 't leave home , but I was taken from it . 
And I hoped ... I prayed ... That , someone would come and save me . 
But ... In the end , it wasn 't my family who did . It was the police . 
Even when you are alone , you don 't have to feel lonely . 
There are infinite lights in this world . 
You just you just have to see them in the dark . 
My , cellphone number is on there , just in case you need me . 
I 'm sorry , I just I 've never had anyone look out for me before . I 've never even had anyone miss me . 
I think someone does . 
I , I spoke to Caitlyn . You did ? 
I did , and I , um ... I have a feeling that ... Your " Teddy bear " is still out there . 
What do I do now ? 
You start to heal . You take your meds . 
Maybe ... talk to a therapist . 
And in a few more years , you 're gonna head out into the ... Great , big world and find your own place , and find a new family . 
What you 've been through you can face anything . 
Am I allowed to hug a police officer ? 
Y-Yes , yes . Today , you are , young lady . 
Um ... one question . 
Why did " Hannah Marie sutter " decide she wanted to be " Maya " ? 
" Shadows on the wall , noises down the hall life doesn 't frighten me at all . " 
Maya angelou . 
No one 's braver than her . 
That 's why I 'm " Maya . " 
That ... That sure looked cozy with the inspector earlier . 
Got a nice side of compliments with my caffeine . Good . You deserve it . Seems like a decent man . 
Yeah . Hey , let me ask you something . 
He wouldn 't happen to have a reason to keep his eye on Jay , would he ? 
What do you mean ? I don 't know . 
Jay 's not up to something ... 
Not that I know of . 
No . It 's probably nothing . 
Hey . 
So what 's with the , covert action ? 
This is just between us . Okay ? 
We started a conversation about braun in my office yesterday and I think we should finish it . 
I-I don 't know what you want me to say , Nik . 
I don 't trust this guy . I think he 's a bad dude . I 'm telling you , Nik . I 'm onto something here . You gotta trust me . 
No . No , you 're not , okay ? This right here ... this just posted an hour ago . It 's from central district homicide . Someone confessed . They confessed to building and detonating the bomb that killed John maritz . 
Central has him in custody . 
They got him , Jay . 
I don 't care , I 'm still right . 
I don 't care that you don 't care . It 's over . Case closed .
