Come on , dad . You have to find it . 
Orion should be right there . 
The belt stars burn blue-white at 30,000 degrees . 
Betelgeuse is Orion 's shoulder . Red . 3,500 degrees . 
I 'm trying my best here , Nolan . They all look the same to me . 
Dad ! It 's where the ufos are . 
It 's not just ufos , son . 
I rented an rv for this . 
I know how much you love vehicles . Tonight 's gonna be fun ! 
You said that we would see a ufo . 
I-I said we 'd try . 
Aliens ! 
I wanna go see . 
Nolan , stop ! No . Don 't touch me ! 
How do you always get away from me ? 
The weakest part of your grip is where the fingers meet and the thinnest part of my wrist is at the thumb side . 
I can escape easily , with a wrist rotation and a pivot . 
Come on , dad ! Can we go see the lights ? 
Okay . 
Just stay behind me . All right ? 
I don 't know what it is , let 's keep our distance . Come on . 
Stay close to me , Nolan . 
I knew we 'd see aliens tonight ! 
Shh , shh ! Whatever is out there ... We don 't want to scare it . 
I wanna see . I wanna see aliens . 
Don 't . 
Run . 
Nolan ! Run ! 
- I cannot believe that . 
- I 'm serious . 
Hi , Ronnie . You 're right . 
He does look like the old spice commercial . 
- Thanks . - The body spray . 
Not the stuff you put on the loofah . I told ya so . 
How can I help you , Ronnie ? 
I 'm shocked you 're still here . Y-You 're shocked I 'm still here ? 
I 'm shocked you 're here . What are you doing here ? 
You 're obviously not cleaning . What is she doing here ? I 'm not . I 'm gone . Bye . 
Always great to see you , Ronnie . 
Look , I think you 've upset her . I upset her ? And I would be careful if I were you . She is rooting for the pool boy to win me over . 
Is that , six-pack Jack ? He 's flirting with you again ? I 'll kill ' im . It 's " Jacques , " and he has an eight-pack . Here . It 's done . 
I see you 're changing the subject . We 'll get back to Jack later . How does this work ? It 's a r.A.T ... Remote-access trojan . 
You upload the file , and I will get a c2 channel that hides under maintenance diagnostics . Fantastic . You wanna try that in English ? 
Put that into braun 's computer and I will get to see everything he 's trying to hide . 
Fantastic . 
Now , you sure that you want to do this ? 
I mean , spying on your boss you could get into some pretty big trouble . 
Right . Well , technically , you 're gonna be the one spying on my boss , so I 'm not too worried about it . 
You know what I mean . 
Look , he is coming at us very aggressively . 
All right ? He 's hiding something . You tellin ' me this little thing 's gonna tell us what that is ? Yeah . 
Good . 
Yeah , I know . All right . All you gotta do is get this in braun 's computer . 
All " I " have to do ? It 's gotta be you . Hey , in case you forgot ... I 'm getting married tomorrow . 
I understand , but if we figure out what braun is hiding , then we got him . You understand ? 
All right . What happens if I get caught ? He already banished me to homicide . 
That 's why it 's gotta be you . 
Because he banished me to homicide , his office is on homicide 's floor ... Nobody 's gonna question why I 'm there . All right , yeah . 
It 's gotta be me . All right . How you gonna get into his office ? 
I mean , getting in , that 's not a problem . It 's keeping braun out ... that 's what I 'm worried about . 
Leave that to me . 
Captain Batista . 
There 's a woman here who needs to file a report . Troopers brought her in . 
Thank you . All right . 
I 'm gonna need your help on this . I got you . 
We 're all in this together , okay ? 
Yeah , we better be , because once we do this , there is no going back . 
Are you sure you 're okay with this ? 
Let 's give them a moment alone . Look . 
Braun took the gloves off when he transferred me , okay ? He 's going down . 
Just be a lot better if tomorrow wasn 't , you know the most important day of our lives ? I know . But we got this . Yeah , we do . 
Paul and Nolan went camping last night . 
They saw something in the woods , and Paul went to investigate , and Nolan said that he ... He had to run for his life . 
Run from what ? 
He didn 't see , just ... just a green light . 
Paul sent Nolan back to the rv , and when he didn 't come back in the morning , Nolan said that he had to drive himself to find help . 
Nolan can drive ? 
He likes cars , so Paul 's been teaching him how to drive just-just gokarts and atvs . 
When he 's interested in something , Nolan picks it up really quickly . 
Eventually , he veered off the road , and a state trooper found him . 
You 're very brave . 
He has autism , so he has trouble communicating . 
Paul 's been trying everything he can to try and bond with him driving lessons and car shows . 
Camping trips . They were stargazing . 
No ! We were hunting aliens . 
Did you say aliens ? 
Nolan , what did we talk about ? 
You like that light ? 
He 's fascinated by light . 
He could tell you it 's pretty much all he talks about . 
Cars ... Light ... And aliens . 
That one is 2,500 degrees instead of 2,700 . 
Nolan , you can see that ? 
It 's going to burn out . 
The woods glowed green . It was scary . They took my dad . 
Get Jason and check out that rv . 
I 'm tellin ' you ... I saw a ufo . 
This guy next to me is honking his horn like a walrus in heat , and then bellisario 's screaming " look up . " I look up , okay ? I see something ... 
Zig-zag across the sky . I don 't know what it is ... I checked flight plans , off-book sources . Nothing ! No record ! Unidentified ! I saw ... An unidentified flying object . 
- All right , slow down . Slow down . So you don 't believe in past lives , but you do believe in little green men ? 
Green men ? No . I believe in sexy pink ladies with pointy ears . 
Anyway , you think Paul Miller got overwhelmed with his kid and took off ? 
Maybe . 
Okay , so this kid was here alone last night . 
He drove this boat into a ditch , and then we don 't know where he started . 
Right . And we have no idea where our missing person disappeared . 
That 's 30,000 acres of forest . That 's too much for a manhunt . 
Okay , so let 's just narrow the search down . 
Okay , what do we got ? We got we got a kid who is obsessed with aliens . - Yes . - Like , heavy . 
We have ... An rv rental agreement that was dated yesterday . 
Yep . And there goes our theory that Paul ditched his boy . Come look at this . 
Paul 's wallet ? - Yep . - With ... Some green weirdness . 
You 're telling me you don 't believe in aliens ? 
Where am I ? 
Where 's Nolan ? Where 's my son ? 
No , no , no ! 
- Nik ? - Hey . Did you get anything at the rv ? 
Okay , so Paul 's wallet was left behind , so we don 't think that he ran . But there was a strange substance on the wallet ... Helen is analyzing it . 
That 's not enough . We need to find out where Paul and Nolan were camping before we can even start the search . 
And since Nolan moved the rv from the campsite , it-it 's gonna be challenging . 
Maybe we need to work it from the other direction . 
There was a rental agreement in the rv that puts Paul in Philly yesterday . 
If I can retrace his steps , maybe it 'll lead us to the campsite , where he disappeared . 
Whatever happened , this man 's family needs him back . 
- Issue the alert . - Yeah . 
Hey , Helen . 
Hey . The slimy substance you found on the wallet was tetraborate-decahydrate polyvinyl acetate . 
Okay . That sounds like it 's from outer space . 
Outer space ? I wish ! Heh ! It 's just basic slime , like kids make in preschool . 
Please tell me you didn 't just say " I wish it was from outer space " ? 
You 're not one of those E.T. fanatics , too ? 
I wouldn 't say " fanatic , " but I definitely leave room for the possibility of life beyond earth . 
But you 're a scientist . How can you believe in aliens , with no evidence ? 
The ingredients of life are common throughout the universe hydrogen , oxygen , and carbon . 
And earth can 't be completely unique among the 100 billion stars in each of the 100 billion galaxies . 
With that many variants , life must have formed elsewhere , just like it formed here . 
Aliens must be out there . 
Science almost guarantees it . 
Well , I 'm frightened . Thank you . What 's not to like about aliens ? 
Nik , just stay off my case . Please ! Just stay off my case ! 
Sorry , man . My bad , my bad . 
You got a lot of nerve , asking me back up here . You said it was an emergency ? 
Look . I know that things got heated the last time that we spoke , but you are still my boss , and I have a problem . What is it ? 
The father of a neurodivergent child went missing in 30 square miles of forest , and I just don 't have the manpower for the search , especially since you transferred sergeant sherman . 
I warned you . You should 've listened . 
Just hear me out , Hollis . Okay ? 
You don 't like what I have to say , you have my word I will never say it again . Okay ? 
This is a question of resources . 
We need to find this man , and my people are doing the best they can , but that 's where you 're wrong , right there , Nikki . 
They 're not your people . They 're my people . 
Excuse me ? 
I 'm in charge and I have documented your inability to accept that breach after breach after breach . 
So , let me say it plainly I am done with Jason Grant and I am done with you . Is that clear enough for you ? Crystal . 
Braun ... braun ? 
Inspector ! Hey ! 
Yeah ? Braun is on his way down . 
Please tell me that you 're outta there . 
Almost . 
Stall him . 
I 'll send Jason . 
Actually , something I 've been meaning to talk to you about yeah , what ? 
Tch . I know you have everybody fooled , thinking that you are a good guy , but you 're not a good guy , are you ? 
You really don 't like your job , do you , detective ? 
Yeah , you know , you 're hiding something , and I 'm gonna find out what it is , because that 's what I do . You understand ? Usually , I find people , but for you , I 'm gonna make an exception . Yeah . 
Come on . 
See , the thing is , Jason see , I 've got the ear of the commissioner , the mayor , and they are both very clear that your entire department is on thin ice . 
Don 't make it about the department . It 's not about the department . 
It 's not about mp ... It 's about you and me ... you had a beef with me the second I walked through that door . Problem is , I 'm curious ... why is that ? 
Are you afraid of me ? 
You 're afraid of me , aren 't you ? 
When this thing comes to a head man , and it will ... I want you ... To remember something . 
Yeah ? Tell me . 
You started this . I know . 
Now get out of my way . 
Hey , inspector . Everything good ? 
You get your buddy off of my floor . 
Yes , sir . 
That was fun . 
Copy that . Kemi ? 
Yeah ? 
Mike did it . Wayne has access to braun 's system . 
Geez . And not a moment too soon . 
I just got a credible hit off of the alert . 
Paul Miller got into a fight yesterday , and you 're never gonna guess where . 
You haven 't seen this guy at all ? 
No ? Great . Thanks . 
Thank you . Okay . 
Any luck ? No , but I 'm pretty sure you can find one of your sexy pink alien ladies with pointy ears here . 
You think Wayne would be into an extra-terrestrial thrupple ? 
- That 's funny . 
- I had to say it ! I 'm sorry . 
That 's good . So one of these whack jobs here saw Paul and his kid yesterday ? Yeah , they didn 't give a name , but , yes , they reported that there was some sort of altercation . 
All right , let 's keep going . All right . 
Authentic alien ooze ! Limited supply ! Direct from another galaxy ! 
Does that ooze look familiar to you ? Yeah . Helen said that it was slime , like kids make in elementary school . 
Don 't let the government dupe you ! 
They 've been hiding an alien presence here on earth for years ! 
Hey , Philly pd ! Move out of the way ! 
Out of the way ! Make room ! 
I won 't be silenced ! 
Outta the way ! Outta the way ! 
Now what ? 
Okay . That 's enough . 
Freeze ! 
Okay , folks . 
Move along . Philadelphia pd , everybody . Everything 's fine . 
Come on , you , get up . 
Who are you and why did you run ? I j ... you guys don 't know who I am ? I 'm Terrance . Hashtag " terrancetruth " ? 
Whatever . 
Okay . Have you ever seen this guy , right here ? 
W-W-Wait . This isn 't about my website ... " truth by Terrance " ? 
No , this is about a missing person . 
So , we understand that you got into an altercation with Paul Miller yesterday . That guy ? Okay , fine . Look . 
His kid opened up a container of ooze . Right ? 
Once you open it up , it 's yours . 
That 's it , but the daddy got pissed off about the price 
I 'm just curious ... what is the price of something that you made for 13 cents ? 
It 's 39.99 . 
I don 't like you . Okay , great . 
Anyway . He got it all over his hands and he started freaking out . 
And I get it , okay ? 
I got a neurodivergent nephew . I see what my sister has to go through , so I felt sorry for the guy and I gave him his money back . 
That 's it . Even gave him a primo campsite for ufo hunting . 
That 's good . Where is this campsite ? Okay . Don 't spread it around , please ? 
There is an area 51 right outside the city . " Philly 51 . " 
Okay ? So much ufo traffic , it 's like , an E.T. airport . 
The military has been trying to cover it up for years . 
- Yeah , Philly 51 ? 
- Yeah . Look at these burns . I got them from the ufo-radiated creek water . 
Where ... is ... the campsite ? 
Okay . It 's out by Ridley creek . 
Thank you . Stay right there , don 't move . 
Can I at least you can do nothing ! 
All right , Ridley creek . That 's gotta be where Paul went into the woods . 
Look at those burns . You gotta take Helen to get some creek-water samples , but I 'd set some ground rules with her first . 
No , no . You guys are gonna bond . It 's gonna be a great experience . - It 's gonna be fantastic . 
- Jason ! No-no-no . It 's gonna be great ! 
You 're gonna have a blast . 
What are you hiding behind all these firewalls ? 
Hello . What 's this ? 
Come on , Jay . Pick up . 
One second . Hold on . 
Hey , Wayne . What 's up ? Everything okay ? 
Yeah , I just couldn 't get a hold of Jay and he told me to reach out to you . 
I think I found what braun 's been hiding . All right , yeah , what do you got ? 
The guy that 's in jail for maritz 's murder , Logan barlowe you guys think he 's a patsy , right ? 
Terrance said this is where he sent Paul and Nolan . 
Thanks for bringing me with you . 
- Sure . - I 'm usually a lab rat , but today I get to be a field mouse ! 
Okay , no . What was rule number two ? No singing ? 
That was rule number one . 
No puns . Bingo . 
Okay . I heard that . - Okay . 
- Wait a minute . 
We got tire tracks . 
Back there . 
And a tripod ! 
Yeah , this must be the place . 
They might 've gone this way . Let 's try it . Okay . 
So I searched property records , based on what truther-Terrance told us , and there is no " area 51 " near Ridley creek , but there is a paper mill half a mile north from here . 
Why would Terrance think a paper mill is area 51 ? 
Maybe because they wanted to do everything they could to stay off the grid . 
About 20 years ago , there was an environmental protest at the mill , and it got out of hand and one of the mill workers died . 
And then after that , the mill disappears from public databases scrubbed from Internet searches . 
I mean , the property records require access codes . 
They basically just disappeared from public view . 
So that 's why the ufo crowd thinks this is another area 51 . I mean the ... the alien guy said the creek water burned his hands , right ? Yeah . You need some help ? No , I am good . I am fully prepared . 
Okay . Ooh , look at those . 
Honk , honk ! Okay , yeah . 
Yeah , you just stand back and watch the expert . - All right , standing back . 
Have you done this before ? Yes , I 've done this . 
Many , many , many , many ... 
Just kidding . I 've done it once before . Just once ? 
- Yeah . 
There you go . I have to get this to the lab to figure out exactly what it is , but there are non-polar molecules in here , forming an emulsion . 
So there 's chemicals in the water ? You ... Kemi called it right . - No . - Get it ? - No . - " Chemical . " kemi ... - no ... Called ? Wait a minute , I got something . 
All right , let 's see . 
Paul 's telescope . 
It 's smashed . Maybe he used it against his attacker . 
" Rasp pulp and paper . " 
Okay . So chemicals in the water ... And Paul 's telescope . 
Yeah , we gotta get a search team to that paper mill . 
Captain Batista ? Sarah , did something happen ? 
Has there been any more information about Paul ? 
No , there 's nothing to share yet , but as soon as I have something I will okay , because , sometimes , Nolan draws pictures when he 's upset . 
It 's last night . The aliens . 
So , I think , that the baseball one is about regret because , Paul loves baseball and ... And Nolan 's never interested and ... 
Paul 's favorite player 's Nolan Ryan and he insisted that we name our son Nolan . 
You got a new bulb . 
Are there any more going out ? 
If you look and the pictures ... This is the green glow , right ? That ... that Nolan told you about . 
But then , there 's also this purple light that he never mentioned , and , I don 't know , i-i-i I thought that ... 
That that might help . 
Hey , Nolan ... Can you remember anything else ? 
Anything at all ? 
Okay , well , thank you so much for bringing these in . 
' Kay , now ... I 'll be in touch . 
I 'm running out of air in here ! Please ! 
Help me ! 
Nolan ! 
Thanks for coming in , Mr. Rasp . 
So , we searched the paper mill , and , looked in every broom closet , every chemical vat . 
No ... no Paul Miller . Where 's Paul Miller ? 
Sorry , detective . I don 't know . 
I mean , I came in of my own accord . You have my full cooperation . 
Anything we can do to help with your investigation , we 'll do . 
Great ! We found , a rag from your mill down at the crime scene . 
Well , you have my employee records and security footage , but , I mean , we 've been a family-run business since my grandpa founded us , so I 'd be shocked if an employee had anything to do with this . 
That rag could 've gotten downstream any number of ways . 
It could 've . We 're actually currently running samples on the creek water , where Paul Miller was taken . 
I don 't understand . 
Okay , well , here 's what I think happened . 
I think that Paul saw something that he wasn 't supposed to see . 
What are you implying ? 
I think you know what I 'm implying . 
That water 's not right , it burns , and I 'm gonna find out why . 
We use an epa-certified waste water treatment system for our sludge disposal . 
My mill is clean . It better be . 
It better be , or you 're in big trouble . 
Okay ? You can go for now till I find something more actionable . 
What 's up ? Yo , I 've been trying to reach you ! Wayne called me . 
What 's going on ? Is she okay ? Yeah , she 's fine . Look , she found something . Braun might not be the only cop who 's involved in that maritz bombing . 
More cops ? 
Yeah , well , just one . Maybe . 
But there 's a witness report who was there before the explosion happened . 
What , you 're saying a bomb squad cop was on the scene before the car blew up ? Yes . His name is sergeant Jordan Wells . He used to work directly under braun . 
He might be the guy we gotta talk to . W-Why " might " be ? 
Well , he could be the actual bomber , or he 's just a cop who had business at lock-up and was on the scene when it happened because because , what ... he 's a good cop , and he just wanted to be helpful ? Come on , what do you think ? 
I think I gotta talk to sergeant Wells , figure out what he knows . 
Okay , go do that . Be safe . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . 
Is there something you actually wouldn 't do ? I realized that when I said it . Okay ? Just ... just be careful . Please . Yeah . 
I got results from the creek water we collected . 
Okay . 
It 's contaminated , but not by ufo radiation . 
By what ? Xylan hemicellulose a hazardous chemical by-product of paper production . 
Confirmation the mill is dumping waste illegally . 
Yeah , Paul must 've come across someone dumping the chemicals . 
They came at him . He tried to fight them off with a telescope , but couldn 't . 
But that still doesn 't explain the lights and sounds that Nolan saw . 
He 's convinced it was aliens . 
That 's what 's so exciting ! 
One of the properties of hemicellulose ... What do you mean ? Is that it reacts to uv light . 
It glows ! 
You know , Nolan described every light he saw by color temperature . 
He knew the precise numbers of each star in the sky and light bulbs in this office . But he said that he saw a " green glow " and a " purple light " in the woods last night no color temperatures . 
Ultraviolet light isn 't measured by temperature . It 's measured in wavelengths . 
Maybe Nolan saw uv in the woods . 
Special lamps are often used to spot dangerous chemicals . 
For instance , when you 're dumping them illegally in the dark woods . 
We need to get the owner of the paper mill back in here . Great job , Helen ! 
Okay , talk to me . 
Yep ? Okay , so , the DNA that Helen pulled off of the telescope belongs to ... Steven Moore . 
He did time at allenwood for manslaughter . And now he has a class-c trucker 's license and works for rasp pulp and paper . 
Pull up the employee records that Jason sent over from the paper mill . Got you ... All right , so it looks like Moore is assigned to tanker truck 16 . 
It was clocked out end of the day yesterday , but it doesn 't look like there was a return logged . Give me one second ... Tanker truck 16 never returned to the mill . 
Can you track it ? Yes , I can . 
I have the mill 's fleet-tracking GPS from yesterday . 
Okay , okay . 
Looks like someone stopped here and disabled the GPS . 
Tanker truck 16 went into the woods and never came out . 
And , we know that Paul hit Moore with the telescope by the creek . 
So if we can find the truck then Moore and Paul Miller could still be with it . 
Yeah , but we didn 't see any sign of a tanker . 
I mean , if they drove deep into the woods , that 's 30 square miles of forest that we 're gonna have to search . 
In the dark , and under a canopy of trees . What a mess . 
I have an idea . 
Hey , Jay ? Yeah . We think that Paul 's still in the woods . 
Would you meet us at Ridley creek ? 
But we 're gonna need your friend you know , the eye in the sky ? 
Okay . So have him meet us there with his full fleet , and-and bring as many uv lights as he can . - Let 's go , let 's go . 
Our missing person 's still out there . So , we 're gonna blanket the forest with uv lights from 20 drones . 
Captain Batista ! Okay , let 's go . 
What ... what are you guys doing here ? 
We 've been driving around the forest . I didn 't know what else to do , and-and Nolan insisted . 
My dad 's out there somewhere . 
Nolan saw the lights from the car , so I mean , what 's happening ? 
We think we know how to find your husband . 
Just in drive . Okay . Cody , I missed you , buddy . How you been ? 
So what exactly am I looking for , and where exactly is the 2,000 you promised me ? 
You 're cash-up-front now ? 
I thought you do the thing and then I pay ya afterwards . Right ? Right ? 
Thank you . Okay ... There 's chemicals on and around the truck that glow green when uv light hits ' em . 
All right . That 's hopefully where our guy is . 
Kemi and I are gonna jump on the bikes and head out there . You can ride a bike , yes ? 
Try keepin ' up , baby . 
Okay . She 's got nuggets . We could 've used her in Kabul . 
Yeah . All right , I 'm gonna go watch ' em go up . Yeah . 
Initiating take-off now . 
Step back . 
Here we go . Just watch , okay ? 
We 're going to find your dad . 
- We good ? 
All right . So the uv lights should be able to spot the chemical signature on the truck . 
Hopefully , that 's where Paul is . 
Where are you ? 
There 's cops everywhere , you 've gotta get out of there . 
I see lights in the sky . They 're gonna find me . 
You said I was just gonna keep him out here till you figured out what to do . 
You were just supposed to dump the sludge , not kidnap somebody ! 
If the police find you , the whole company goes under ! 
Guy saw me dumping , hit me with something , I hit him back . 
He 's almost dead already . 
Can you help it along ? Get it done faster ? 
But not in the truck . That will tie him back to the mill . 
Kill him ? In the creek . 
Make it look like he fell in and hit his head . What about the truck ? Leave it . I 'll ... I 'll report it stolen tomorrow . 
I can pay you . Triple what I paid to dump the sludge . It 's gonna cost way more than that . 
Whatever it takes . 
You need to get a hold of yourself . 
You 're not thinking this through . 
Relax . 
Whatever Grant learned from barlowe , it 's a dead-end . 
Hold on . 
They 've been in my computer . Yes , it 's a problem . 
No . No-no-no-no-no-no . 
Wayne , I gotta call you back . Mike ! I I can 't get a hold of Jay , but something 's happened . Listen , I 'm at Jordan Wells ' house the bomb squad cop . 
He might be the actual maritz bomber . He 's been building bombs at home . I 'll call you back . 
Not seeing anything . It 's there . Keep going . 
Come on . 
You 're getting outta here . Come on ... 
That looks like the outline of the creek . What 's that next to it ? 
Right there , right there . Hold on . Right there . 
That looks like it ! That 's it . - Okay . 
Coordinates , coordinates . - Sent it to your phones . All right , let 's ride . 
Let 's ride . - Beautiful . - Tell Nikki we 're on our way . Copy that . 
Steve Moore ! 
The longer you drag this out , the worse it 's going to get for you . 
Paul ! 
Paul , we 're here to take you home . 
Help ! - Help ! 
- Down , down , down ! 
Stay down . Stay down . 
Hey , hey , hey . Relax , relax . 
You 're under arrest for the kidnapping of Paul Miller . 
Jason . You good ? 
Yeah . You got some handcuffs ? 
Hey . Hi . I kept asking to see you . 
They rushed you away so quickly . 
Captain Batista had us meet you here . 
- Are you hurt ? - I 'm fine . 
Nolan , guess what ? 
When I was out there and the bad man had me , I remembered your wrist trick to escape . You saved my life . 
It is moments like this that make me love this job . 
According to Helen , it 's more probable than not that there 's aliens out there . 
Something about " the basic elements of life . " 
I don 't know , maybe she 's right . 
Space is infinite , infinite possibilities . 
Well , in a universe of infinite possibilities , this was the best possible outcome . 
We 'll leave you guys a moment . - Thank you . 
- Of course . - Thank you ... 
So you 're a driver now ? 
He is ! - So sweet . - Coffee ? 
Yes , please . 
- Hey , Nik . 
How you doing ? You think mpu could reimburse me for a new phone or what ? 
On top of the $ 2,000 for your very strange drone guy ? 
All right , I might be able to salvage it . - Let me take a look , yeah . - Thank you . 
So , the hazardous waste team said that the water will dilute back to normal as long as we stop the dumping . 
All right , well , I 'm going to go put some jewelry on rasp . 
The trucker ratted him out . 
Rasp was paying him to dump waste from the paper mill and then he freaked out when Paul saw him dumping and then rasp gave the kill order when we were closing in . 
Epa fines are one thing , but conspiracy to murder that will put him away for a while . 
- Great work . - Yep . 
- You sure you don 't want any ? - No , I can 't . 
You hear from Mike ? 
Not yet . Why ? 
Where 's that photo that Wayne sent me ? 
It 's the same trigger from the maritz bombing . 
Who the hell are you ? 
Jordan Wells . I 'm sgt . Mike sherman , Philly pd . 
Do me a favor . Put that weapon down . 
What 're you doing in my work shed , sgt . Sherman ? 
I know you 're the one that made that bomb that killed John maritz . 
Who put you up to it ? Was it braun ? 
Say his name , we might be able to get you a deal . 
Cops live short , miserable lives behind bars . 
I get busted , my family gets nothing . 
No insurance . No pension . Nothing . 
When he told me people were digging into Logan barlowe , I figured this day would come . 
When who told you ? Braun ? 
This is the only way to protect my family . I 'm no good to them behind bars . What are you doing ? 
If I die in an accidental explosion , my ex gets taken care of . My kids have a life . 
Nothing personal , but I can 't leave you behind to say this was anything other than an accident 
- don 't do it . - I 'd do anything for my family . Don 't do it . 
Pick up , pick up . 
Jason , I need you . He knows .
