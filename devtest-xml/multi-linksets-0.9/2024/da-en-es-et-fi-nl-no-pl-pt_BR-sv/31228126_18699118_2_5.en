Keep it steppin ' with that big-headed buffalo . Hush ! 
My bark is bigger than yours . 
Good morning to you , too , Ms. Patty . 
How many times have I told this child you cannot leave your bike sit in the middle of the road ! 
You 're right . That 's right . 
Don 't mess with Ms. Patty . I told you ! 
Good . 
Mornin ' , Patty . Excuse me ? 
I mean , Ms. Patty . 
Did you see , I 'm repainting my window frames ? 
I made sure it 's up to snuff this time . 
I went with the avocado green the color that you recommended . 
It 's a distinguished color . I think so , too . 
I 'll see you tonight at the block contest . Excuse me , Harold . 
Hell no ! 
Get out here and pick up this mess , you he ... 
- Hey . - Hey . Come on in . 
Is this a ... Good time or a bad time ? 
Neither . Actually , it 's my spa time . So , if can you make it quick ? 
" Spa time . " I didn 't realize the four seasons came through and installed spas here . Hilarious . No , I was serious . 
The water at this dump hits peak heat between exactly 9 : 15 and 9 : 23 , and I just lost a minute of that to answer the door for you , so , whatever you 're doing here better be worth it . 
I brought you a laptop ? 
Yeah , that 's a decent start . 
I need you to look into ... Something . 
What , another work favor ? 
Mpu should really just consider adding me to the payroll at this point . 
This is not mp 
Nikki thinks our new boss is clean . I think he is , dirty . Have a look . 
That 's the car bomb that killed John maritz and his lawyer ? Correct . 
And this is the guy that just confessed to the crime . All right ? His name is Logan barlowe . 
He 's got priors that fit , he 's been dormant for the last three years , so , I ask you , why ? 
Well , you know that could be a million reasons . 
Right ... braun , he takes this guy right to the D.A. And confesses ... all tied up in a bow . That 's not goofy to you ? No . 
That ... that is weird . 
Right . I don 't care what Nikki says , this guy braun is involved in this , and I need you to find a connection between braun and Logan . Yes . No , no eBay , no Amazon , no doordash . 
Please . Okay . Great . You gonna let go ? Okay . 
Thanks . Thank you ! 
What up , y 'all ? Hey . 
Buenos dias . Just 
hey , hey . Your mug . Thanks . 
Please tell me it 's nothing that can 't be ironed out . 
What are you talking about ? 
Whatever fight y 'all had , are having , or want to be having , and instead , you 're dancing around like very polite strangers . 
I don 't know what that means , but we 're not fighting . 
Okay , I am thrilled to officiate your wedding , but not until you two figure out whatever this is . We 're fine . 
Okay , I hear it . 
I receive it ... But come find me when you 're ready to be honest about what 's going on , because it 's giving " we need an inter-friend-tion . " 
Captain Batista ? We have a walk-in . Thank you . I need a few more details , Harold . 
Does Patty have any ... 
she prefers " Ms. Patty . " 
Does Ms. Patty have any health issues ? Any ... any signs of dementia ? No ! 
She 's as sharp as a tack , and the finest block captain in Philly . 
Gotta be healthy , what , with all the cleanups and the fundraisers . 
And you 're sure she didn 't just slip away for a few days ? 
6,000 captains in Philly , and Ms. Patty 's won the " cleanest block " contest five years running . 
Today was the reception announcing this year 's winner , and she was a no-show ! She 'd never miss that - not in a million years . - Right . I looked for her at her house , checked her favorite office supply store , her favorite cafes . 
Plus , she isn 't answering her phone , and she always answers her phone ! 
I mean , maybe she had a family emergency ? 
Do you know any of her relatives that we can reach out to ? 
Not as far as I know . Truth is , we haven 't really talked about much , other than the block . 
Harold , thank you so much for coming in . 
Let us look into it , okay ? 
Ms. Patty 's special . Smart and feisty , and her heart ... Well , it 's solid gold . 
Ever since I moved to Philly last year , seeing Ms. Patty 's the brightest moment of my day . 
You have to find her . Please . 
Harold , you have my word . We 'll do everything we can . Okay ? 
Thank you . 
Notify hospitals , precincts ... And put a trace on her phone . - Yeah . - Okay . 
Make the damn call , lady . 
That gun supposed to scare me ? 
Go ahead ! Do it . Kill an old lady . 
Keep running your mouth , and I will . 
We know you got Maurice 's number in your contacts under a different name . Call him , now ! 
You got the wrong idea , if you think I 'm giving him up . 
You think I 'm playing ? Fine ! All right ! All right . O-Okay , fine . 
- 911 , what 's your ... - Help ! Help ! I 've been taken ! Hey ! You better go ahead and kill me , ' cause I 'm not telling you a damn thing . 
Hey . Checked with all the hospitals . None of them have an elderly woman that matches the description of Ms. Patty . 
And nothing from the precincts . You better try the coroner . 
Yep . 
We just gonna keep pretending nothing 's wrong ? 
We are not " pretending . " I-I just don 't want to bring our issues into work , honey . 
Okay , then let 's resolve it . 
And I don 't like it . 
- That 's not true . - Yes , it is . All the looks , all the sidebar 
Nikki , we 're getting married , okay ? 
You can 't do this . 
But we have an endangered woman out there and right now is just not the time . Yes ? 
- Is ... - You can come in . 
Okay . I got Ms. Patty 's cellphone records . 
The phone is off , so I can 't trace the location , but the last call she made was to 911 . 
The dispatcher said that she yelled for help and then the call was shut down . 
Put out the alert . 
I found her binder in the alley . 
How well you know Ms. Patty ? 
I avoid her at all costs . Why 's that ? 
She filed a complaint with the restaurant . Said I was careless with the trash cans . 
You believe it ? I 'm just doing my job . 
I get it , man . You catch her on a bad day , she 's a real tyrant . Right ? Oddly , today , I 'm not in the mood to disagree . 
You see anything that might suggest Patty was targeted ? 
" Ms. Patty . " And sure . Take your pick . Not a single person on this block who hasn 't seen the wrath of " sgt . Block captain Ms. Patty . " 
All right . You know what ? I think , for once , gentrification might help . 
Saw a bunch of fancy doorbell cameras on those houses . 
Where exactly did you find the binder ? - Right there . - Right here ? Sorry if something happened to her , but the way she goes around henpecking , maybe she finally pecked the wrong cock . Good luck , boys . Thanks . 
So , Harold worships her , Tony says she 's a pain in the ass . Who is this woman ? I 'm guessing it 's someone who wouldn 't get a cheese stain on her binder ... Or litter , or eat cheetos , for that matter . 
Someone pick that up . We should have Helen run a print . 
Well , maybe , random cheeto-guy walks through the alleyway , finds it after she was taken . Maybe . Hey , Tony ! Yeah ? 
You get a lot of traffic through this alleyway ? Nope . Used to be the occasional druggie , but ever since Ms. Patty took over , it 's easier to go a few blocks down than deal with her . 
Yeah , all right , thanks . 
Hey , I got a theory . Can I run it by you ? 
- Yeah , what do ya got ? 
- ' Kay . Move over to your left a little bit . Right there . 
Good . 
What are you doi ... ? 
You mind telling me why the hell you just assaulted me ? 
Drop down a little bit . There it is ! Perfect . That 's blood from a head blow , and I 'm guessing that it belongs to Ms. Patty . 
And then there 's my theory . 
It 's actually not that bad . Thanks . 
I love a good party ! Just not one I can hear after ... girl . 
We confirmed the blood in the alleyway was Ms. Patty 's . 
Please tell me you got something . Okay . 
It 's a strong maybe . So the neighbors , provided doorbell camera and security footage , which I was able to reconstruct Ms. Patty 's , route , and it did not disappoint . 
You want some popcorn ? 
No thanks . Okay . So , Ms. Patty 's first stop is Mr. Henderson , who lives across from her . 
Seems like you forgot the lawn maintenance rules , so I called a landscaper . 
The bill 's in your mailbox . 
Don 't forget to tip . Is she serious ? 
It gets better . After Mr. Henderson , she goes to Mrs. Jacobs ' house ... But you know that 's my car . And I live on this street ! 
Do you know how much that 's gonna cost me ? 
No permit , no parking , Mrs. Jacobs . If I let you park without a permit , it wouldn 't be fair to the others . 
Here 's the number for the tow truck company . 
And it goes on and on , until she sees Harold , and then we lose sight of her . 
So we went from no motives at all to too many to count ? 
I mean , the question is , is who was provoked enough to harm her ? Harm who ? 
Not Ms. Patty , I hope . 
Did you see her binder ? 
This woman is an organization queen ! 
Yeah , well , she 's also a maniac . 
Maybe she 's just misunderstood , like my two most-favorite musical-theater villainesses . Can you guess which ones ? 
Ms. Hannigan from " Annie " and evillene from " the wiz " ! Duh . 
Something you need , Helen ? Yes ! Yes . Ease on down the road ... To my office . 
I couldn 't pull a print from the binder other than Ms. Patty 's , but I know why someone might 've had the munchies . 
There 's cannabis resin in the cheese dust . Wait . 
How 's that possible ? 
Weed crystals . They linger on surfaces longer than you can feel or smell them . 
Isn 't that ... dope ? 
Please don 't start with the puns . 
If weed puns are a sin , I 'll see you all ... inhale . 
I 'm guessing Ms. Patty is the opposite of baked . Okay ? 
Which means the trace is likely from whoever grabbed her . 
I 'll identify the strain , see if that gets us anywhere . 
I 'll follow up with the neighbors . Yeah ? 
Hey , you guys ? So , Ms. Patty filed complaints with parking , housing , animal control , but one of them paid off . 
- Get Jason . - Yeah . 
His name is Julian meeks . He owns an auto repair shop . 
He 's got a full jacket assault , burglary , you name it . 
Right , so kidnapping 's an escalation ... not a surprise . Ms. Patty filed multiple complaints against him , said he was casing cars , what are you doing ? I got a feeling this is the type of guy that doesn 't like cops . 
Hey , hey , hey . Let 's not jump to conclusions , all right ? 
Right , because you think badging a guy like meeks is the way to go ? 
" Hey ! You got any victims in here ? " " Sure , this way ... since you badged me . She 's tied up , right in the back . See her ? Right there . " 
All right . Hey , hey . Enough . We 're here . It 's meeks ' place . 
Is that your boy Harold ? 
Maybe lover boy 's not telling us something . 
Or he 's the one behind it and he 's paying this creep for kidnapping Ms. Patty . 
Julian meeks is top of Ms. Patty 's you-know-what list . 
I think maybe he grabbed her . 
I put a down payment on a car so I could , you know , case the joint . 
- " Case the joint . " - That 's right ! 
No disrespect , Harold , but that was a really dumb idea . 
This is my chance to be her hero . 
You know , she picked Lonnie Jones up at school every day for two months because his mother was sick ? She organized a food drive for Mr. Klein , ' cause he couldn 't afford groceries . 
Now , she may be prickly , but this is a woman - worth fighting for . - Harold , Harold . Listen , we don 't need you to be a knight in shining armor . All right ? 
We need you to be safe , so that Ms. Patty has someone to come home to . 
But I can help ! 
I can do something ! You 've already helped . All right ? 
You did something . You gave me an idea . 
I appreciate it , but now I need you to go home . Please . 
Thank you , Harold . 
W-W-What 's in your trunk ? 
My basketball kids ' trophies . Why ? 
No reason . 
What 're you doing ? What 're you doing ? Hey , hey , hey . No ! 
- Sorry . - Why ? 
Why , why ? Why ? 
What are you doing ? 
Will you relax ? I know a place we can get it fixed . Don 't tell Nikki , please . 
I wasn 't planning on it . 
What the heck happened here ? 
Something stupid hit it . Will you go for a walk , please ? 
He 's very upset . He thinks it 's my fault . 
Anyway , what he meant to say was unfortunate things happen . 
We appreciate you fitting us in . I assume you 've got a busy schedule , so thank you very much . I just got to the shop . - Just now ? 
- Yeah . 
I mean , it 's a little late in the day . 
What , you ... busy morning , or 
I 'm just curious for the future . You know , if I 've got any repairs that 
I keep a flexible schedule . - You do ? - Yeah . That 's good ! What 's over there ? I 'm talking to you here . 
Hey , Donny ? - Donny ! - Hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey ! 
Ain 't nothing for you back there . 
No , I just ... I gotta use the bathroom . 
Bathroom 's out of order . Hey ! 
Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Hey ! Lookit . Lookit . Lookit . Lookit . Lookit . Relax . You sit down . Sit down . 
- Don 't move . - Sit down . That means you relax . 
Chill out . Okay ? Okay . Good . 
This is what you idiots are doing ? 
Car parts ? 
What do you got ? Sending catalytic converters to China ? 
It 's a felony . 
We 're cops , by the way . Philly pd . 
Hands behind your back . Don 't move . 
Whoo . That looked like it hurt . 
No . No , Harold , they didn 't find her . 
We followed up with your neighbors . 
We 'll keep you posted , okay ? Absolutely . Absolutely . Okay . That man is in love . 
Hey , what 's going on with you and Mike ? 
Nothing . - Nothing ? 
- Nothing . 
- Okay . - Nothing 's going on . 
We know you had a run-in with Ms. Patty , which gives you a motive . 
I didn 't touch her . I 'm gonna ask you this one time ... where is she ? 
I don 't know . 
I mean , I 'd happily kill her , but actually spending time with her ? No way ! You 're like the neighborhood rodent , Julian . 
All right ? Under every damn car . 
Look , I 'm gonna make you a deal . Okay ? 
You tell me something that matters , and I 'll forget about the stolen converters . 
Or I put you in jail , and let the other rodents freakin ' eat you . - You got me ? - Fine . 
I was checking out a car , and I saw Ms. Patty , so I ... I hid , and these two guys jumped out of a Van . 
They roughed her up , and then they , they just grabbed her and they drove off . 
Okay . You see their faces ? Nah . 
They were wearing masks . You didn 't think to say anything ... You 're doing that thing with your neck . 
I don 't know what you 're talking about . 
When y-you 're pissed off , you rub your neck in a certain way , and you 're clearly pissed off . 
I 'm not pissed off . 
Okay . It 's that bad ? I 'm innocent ! 
I don 't know what your definition of innocent ... You know what 's bad ? An elderly woman missing for eight hours . That 's what 's bad . 
- That 's ... I agree . - Por favor . All right , what about the Van ? 
Make , model , license plate ? 
Well , I-I didn 't catch the plate . 
Listen , listen , I don 't have time for this . All right ? 
And I 'm letting you know right now , those rodents inside of prison ... very , very hungry . You got it ? 
It was a blue Chevy astro . All right ? 
Now , that 's all I know ! 
Yeah . No , I doubt that . 
Hey , man , my thing is cars , okay ? Not old ladies ! 
And even if she wasn 't nuts ... which she is I would not mess with Ms. Patty . 
Her son has a bodyguard with a bad side I do not want to get on . What are you talking about ? 
Well , Ms. Patty doesn 't have any children . No , she does not . 
Ms. Patty , she 's not a mother . Well , not biological . 
Hey , you know what , that 's it . You wanna know more ? You deal me outta here . Hey , hey . 
No , you don 't get it . All right ? No , you don 't get a deal . 
You just tried to assault an officer . - You know what that ... - hey I just spoke to his buddy from the garage . Apparently , you don 't pay him very well , ' cause he just ratted you out crazy . I don 't believe that . 
All right , I don 't care what you believe or not . 
I mean , I-I thought we only had him on the converters , but now your file just went from " really big " to " never see the light of day , ever again . " Yeah . 
It 's bad . Okay . 
All right . 
What do you want ? 
I want names . All right ? Numbers , addresses . Right now . 
Last march , I was casing a BMW out front of Ms. Patty 's house , and , next thing you know , I 'm surrounded by " mo betta " and his entourage of d-bags . 
Yeah , well , it turns out that was his car . 
Mo betta , the rapper ? Yeah . Wow . He 's an mc . He 's , kinda nice with it . He just put out a record ... a new record . Last record ... 
I mean , he 's gonna blow up . Do you mind ? Yeah . 
I 'm just a fan , that 's all . 
Word on the street ... She practically raised him . 
Who the hell raised you ? 
I eat punks like you for breakfast . Shut up ! 
Stop it , man ! She 's hurt . 
I know that voice . Kevin ? 
Kevin Darnell Dixon ! Is that you ? Y-You don 't think I 'd recognize that lisp , or that chipped front tooth ? 
Are you crazy ? 
I 've known you since you was a little boy ! 
What 's wrong with you ? 
I know your mama ! 
You just had to open your big mouth , didn 't you ? 
We 're not trying kill the lady . We 're just trying to use her to get to mo ! 
She I.D.Ed you , you moron . 
You want your respect and due from mo , fine , but it ain 't gonna mean a damn thing if they live to turn us in . 
I hired you , you get me ? 
Remember that . 
Put that down ! 
Final warning . 
Our beef is with mo and it ain 't with you . 
Tell us what contact he 's under ! 
I would protect that boy with my life . 
The answer was no then , and it 's no now ! 
Yeah ? Aight . 
We gonna do this a different way . 
What are you doing ? 
Plenty more bullets where that came from . 
Blues ! 
The name is under " blues . " 
" Mo betta blues . " Clever . 
Why don 't you take a seat , Maurice . Thank you . 
So you had no idea Ms. Patty was in trouble ? 
You calling me well , we 're trying to find her , so , anything ... anything that you could tell us may help . 
Why ... Why don 't you take me back to the beginning ? 
When my real mom died , I ... I had no one . 
Bounced around from couch to couch , only eight years old . 
Starving . Lonely . But the day I met Ms. Patty was ... The day I learned people could be kind in this world . 
" Kind " is not a word a lot of people have used to describe her . 
Don 't get me wrong . She still terrifies me . 
I bet ! 
But she saw I was in need , and took in a kid everyone else had already written off . 
Ms. Patty sees people 's potential . How so ? 
When she noticed my interest in music , she forced me to learn the piano . " If you 're gonna do it , do it right . " 
That 's her motto . 
Made me practice ! 
Even helped me come up with my stage name . 
" Mo betta " was her idea ? 
She 'd go around telling people I had " mo betta " style , looks and lyrics than any Philly rapper . Let me ask you something . 
Do you think that maybe someone might be using her to get to you ? 
Hard to say . 
Lotta haters , you know ? 
Occupational hazard . 
But Ms. Patty doesn 't deserve this . No , I agree with you . 
She doesn 't deserve it . 
So if there 's anything else you want to tell me , now would be the time . 
I got nothing . 
We 'll be in touch . 
He 's hiding something . 
I want to know what it is . 
I 'll look for his online presence , see if there are any red flags . I want him followed . 
Whatever mess he 's in , it 's blowing back on that poor old woman . 
I got you . 
Hate to admit it , but Nikki was right . This dude 's not telling us something . 
Yeah , there 's a lot of that going on lately . 
Okay , that 's enough . 
You 've officially just surpassed your daily quota for passive-aggressive comments . What 's the matter with you ? 
Why don 't you ask your ex-wife ? 
I did ask her . Now I 'm asking you . 
I don 't need relationship advice right now , all right ? You want to help me out ? 
You can do the paperwork explaining why I need a new side mirror . - How about that ? - Okay . 
You eat her leftovers ? She hates that . We 're not doing this . We 're not doing this ! 
You forgot to put the toilet seat back down , what ? 
I don 't do any of those things . That 's why she 's marrying me . 
You should buy flowers . - Enough . All right ? 
- Gotcha . 
There 's mo and his bodyguard . 
Something going down at this nightclub ? 
I made a promise to myself and my people ... Hey ! You know that cannabis I found on Ms. Patty 's binder ? 
Yeah ? It 's a strain called " evergreen bliss . " Okay . 
Find out who grows it and where they sell it . 
Already on it . Thank you . 
Whoa ... mo betta 's bodyguard was right . 
This stuff gets ugly . 
Ooh ! This is it ! " Evergreen bliss " is produced exclusively by one grower in the greater Philly area . 
Okay , find out which dispensaries they sell to . 
If we can get a customer list , maybe it gives us who took Ms. Patty . 
- On it ! - Thank you . 
When you on the grind , you bound to have some haters ! 
Excuse me one second . Philly pd . We need to get inside . 
Yeah . I just need to see a warrant . 
A warrant ? 
Or a $ 100 bill . 
This Miami ? 
Look , we got an old lady missing . 
Well , she isn 't in here ! 
Yeah , no . Probably not , but , you know , this is ... This is kind of a fire hazard . 
And if we wanted to , we could probably just shut the place down . 
Hey , yo ! Everybody , make noise for Philly 's very own mo betta ! 
Yo . Where the hell is Kevin ? Where is Kevin ? 
- I haven 't seen him today , bro . 
Hey , Philly ! How y 'all feelin ' ? 
How 're we gonna find him in this ? I don 't know . 
- Yeah , hello ? - Wayne . - Hello ? - Wayne ! Can you hear me ? - Hello ? 
- Jay ? 
Jay , I can barely hear you . Are you at a concert ? 
No , I 'm at a nightclub ! 
But a nightclub ! I wanna be at a nightclub . 
No , no , you don 't . 
It 's crowded in here . I 'm having trouble finding this guy . 
I need you to track mo betta 's phone . How fast can you do that ? 
Five minutes . 
That 's not gonna be fast enough . 
Never mind . I 'll call you back . 
Hey ! Is your boss back there ? 
Who wants to know ? 
I need to speak to him . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! 
Hey , my man . 
You feel that ? That 's a gun in your back . 
Let my partner go . Very good . Now , where 's mo ? 
Where 's he going ? I don 't know ! 
Why did he come to this club tonight ? 
He 's got beef with an old friend . Mo thought he 'd be here . 
All right . What 's the guy 's name ? 
I don 't get paid to ask questions . 
No , no , no , no . You get paid to protect him , and you are doing a terrible job . 
Get him on the phone right now . - I can 't . 
- Why not ? Mo gave me his phone . 
Didn 't want anybody tracing it . 
Anything happens to him , it 's on you . You know that , right ? 
Jay ! Jay , you gotta see this . 
You shot me . 
Maurice , don 't listen to them , baby . Don 't come ! 
Yeah . He got a text message , too . 
" Ditch your phone . Come alone , or she dies . " 
No location , right ? 
- No . - Mo must 've known where to go . 
We 're screwed . So is Ms. Patty . 
Traffic cam picked up mo 's SUV when he got on the northbound expressway . 
No idea where he 's going , but we 're working on it . 
Keep moving north . You got anything from that video ? 
Just confirmation that society has reached a new level of crazy if they 're shooting women in the legs . - Ridiculous . - Yeah . 
Tell me about it . 
Metadata is disabled , so I can 't pull a location . 
What about background sounds ? 
I couldn 't dig anything out , but I 'll keep trying . 
Mo thinks that he can save Ms. Patty on his own . 
If we don 't get there in enough time , we might have two victims . 
I may have something . 
And that is a medical dispensary . Okay ? The customer info is protected by hip a a 
I mean , I can get a warrant , but we don 't have time for a warrant . - Exactly . 
- And that 's why I called a friend . 
Not actually my friend , but you know , " your friends are my friends , " so ... heh . - Wayne ? 
- Yeah , Wayne . 
Mpu volunteer hotline . How can I help you ? All right , tell me you got something . 
Working on it . Almost there . Okay . No pressure . Just that customer list is the only thing that 's gonna help us find Ms. Patty at this point . 
There , I 'm in . 
Searching for customers who 've bought evergreen bliss . All right . 
Which ones live on her block ? 
Just give me their names . 
Noah Avery , Gabriel Cartwright , Kevin Dixon . 
Kevin Dixon ? Tch . That 's " no-phi deluxe . " - Who ? 
- Sorry , who ? He 's a ... he 's a producer . 
Him and mo betta been working together for years . 
He did a bunch of mixed tapes . He just blew up . He 's , like , on the source 's He 's also gotta be the dude that the bodyguard was talking about . 
That is a deep cut . How is it that you know so much about hip-hop ? 
' Cause I 'm a " g . " I 'll tell you about it later . 
Long story . " Long story , " he says . A " g " ? 
Yeah . Kemi , I need you to tell Nikki that we need everything that you got on Kevin Dixon . All right ? 
He 's a producer . He 's probably the one that took Ms. Patty . - Talk to me . 
- That 's him , Kevin Dixon . 
I did a records search and found a court filing . 
It 's still pending , but Kevin sued mo about a year ago . Sued him for what ? 
Mo dropped him as producer , right before he signed his new record deal . 
I mean , it has " betrayed friend " written all over it . 
Okay , so we have a motive . Do we have a location ? The lack of ambient sound was bothering me , so I stripped the voices . 
Take a listen to that . I don 't hear anything . 
Exactly . 
The room is soundproof . 
Find out if Kevin Dixon has a recording studio . 
- Yeah . - Good job ! 
The studio is called " boogie beats . " On north broad . 
Alright , that 's hunting park . We 're ten minutes out . 
It 's the vertical pedal on the right . Make it five . Come on . 
Where you at , Kevin ? 
You scared now ? 
Stop hiding ! 
I kept the cops out of it . Now show yourself ! 
Mama Patty ! Baby ! No , be careful ! Be careful ! 
Ooh , I guess one of us finally grew a pair . 
One of us still got a chip on his shoulder and in his big mouth . 
Maurice , there 's two of them ! Maurice ! Maurice ! 
The party 's over . 
Imma need that . 
That 's the Van Ms. Patty was taken in . You don 't think we need backup ? 
We don 't have time for that . 
Why do I spend half my life thinking you 're gonna get us killed ? Focus on the other half . 
Hold up . 
Baby ! 
It 's business ! The label wanted me to use their own producers . 
You think this is about the music ? 
I 've lived in your shadow , since we was kids , and you had her greasing the way every step . 
You got the scholarship I wanted . You got the girl I wanted . 
You became the hometown hero ! " Mo betta . " 
And I stood by you . Every step . 
I know you did . That 's why I let you produce my last album . 
So that you could go and re-record our tracks , mo ? And cut me out of the profits ? 
That 's the last straw , mo , you phony piece of 
I 'm sorry ! 
I 'm sorry . 
I get that you 're angry , but ... Why mess with Ms. Patty ? 
You could 've just talked to me . I couldn 't ! You changed your damn phone ! 
You think my first option was kidnapping an old lady ? 
You got one more time to call me " old lady , " checker-tooth ! 
Thing is , Maurice as long as you 're alive , kev 's gonna have to keep living in your shadow . 
But if you gone , well ... 
They 're gonna kill you . 
Kevin still has a cut of the last album . Sales 'll skyrocket ! 
It didn 't have to be this way , mo . 
Go see what 's up . You ! 
You stay right there . 
I 'm going left . 
Hey ! Hey . Philadelphia police department . Put your gun down . 
Drop the gun . I 'll shoot . ' Kay . I swear to god . On the ground ! Toss it ! On the ground ! 
Kick it away . 
Kick it ! 
Okay . All good . Now what ? 
Hands behind your back . 
Everything you done for me , mama Patty I 'm sorry my music put you in harm 's way . 
As long as you are safe , that 's all I care about . 
I was never blessed with children , but filling that hole in your life means the world to me . 
I love you . 
Yeah . Does that world have room for one more ? 
Harold ! What are you doing here ? 
Helping the mpu find you , of course . 
They said I was a big help . 
I got everyone on the block to sign it , even stuffy Mrs. Jacobs , who forgives you for getting her car towed . 
I also got you new page protectors and some sticky tabs . 
This is so sweet of you . 
Ms. Patty , I 've been in love with you from the moment you welcomed me to the neighborhood . 
I hate that I wasn 't brave enough to tell you , but the thought of not getting that chance scared me even more . 
I 'm the luckiest man on earth that , out of all the blocks in Philly , I ended up on yours . 
Why , Harold . 
You might be the first person to ever make me speechless . 
I 'll gladly accept that honor . 
One more thing your reign continues . 
Ooh ! Could this night get any sweeter ? 
How about we celebrate ? With a date ? 
First the hospital , then dinner ? Well 
I already told the paramedics , I don 't need the hospital . 
But a date , I would welcome . 
And Harold ? Just call me Patty . 
No , I 'm not gonna explain anything . 
I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna plead the fifth . 
Interesting . - Yeah . - Yeah . So , this is how you know so much about hip-hop ? 
You were a child rap star ? Prodigy , really , is the ... term that they used , but whatever you want to say . 
Well , you 're a man of hidden talents , Jason Grant . 
" Local rap artist , Jason Grant , takes the scene by storm with his song , ' put your handz up ' " 
it is very interesting that you chose to spell " hands " with a " z . " 
Yeah . I know ... I know you 're being a little shady , but that song was actually fire . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Fire ? - It 's a jam . Yeah . Can I download it online , or do I have to special order some cassette tapes ? 
You 're being funny ! You got jokes ! I like that . That 's cute . 
Yeah , you know what 's not a joke ? If I had known you back then , you would 've been exactly my type . 
" Back then " ? 
Yeah . - Yeah ? - Back then . 
- Yeah . 
- Not ... not your thing anymore ? Just disgusting . 
Just hold that thought for one second . 
I wasn 't expecting this , and I have news . 
You found a connection between braun and the car bomber , or ... ? No . 
- No ? - No , but , I looked into barlowe and ... 
None of his prior bombings have anything but property damage , and so , two people killed doesn 't really fit . Okay ... So then why-why ... why did he flip ? Do you think ? 
Honestly , I 'm not sure . But our hip a a problem earlier gave me an idea . 
I did check his medical records , and . I don 't know why he flipped or why he took the fall , but he he 's not gonna be doing a lot of time . 
Why 's that ? 
Well , he 's got stage-four carcinoma , so he has stage-four carcinoma ? 
Yep . I gotta go tell Nikki . You gotta go tell Nikki ... n-now ? I do . 
The man is in lock-up . 
You know , he 's gonna ... Stay there until tomorrow . 
I gotta go tell her . I-I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . 
I gotta ... I gotta . This proves I 'm right . 
At least he left you . Where were we ? 
Hey , I 'm sorry , I need the really ? 
You 're gonna take my dignity and my happiness ? Shoes ? Really ? 
What did I say ? What did I say ? See ? Ya see ? 
Listen . Jay and I have a shorthand . 
Okay ? And sometimes , I forget to fill you in . 
Yeah , which is weird , considering I 'm marrying you , but somehow I 'm still second on the notifications list . I get it , okay ? 
You want me to share things with you , and I will . 
All right . You want to share things with me ? When I asked you if Jason was up to something , did you lie to me ? Hey . Jay , this really isn 't a good time . 
No , I got to talk to you right now , in private . 
Guess I got my answer . Mike ! Mike ... is that about me ? 
Isn 't it always ? What are you doing back here ? 
Okay , listen . Barlowe . The car bomb . 
I just talked to Wayne . I had her look into it . Jay , I told you 
I know what you told me ! You told me " case closed . " - Case closed . - But it is not . It is not . 
That confession is convenient crap . You understand me ? Convenient crap . 
I 'm telling you , braun is behind this . 
He is using that guy to cover something up . 
Based on what ? 
You 're angry because he 's trying to control you , and I am starting to think he 's right ! He 's playing you . Playing me ? 
No , you have a vendetta against my boss and it is going to kill us , Jay ! Why would you even say that ? 
No . Wha ... of course not . 
You 're gonna cost me my job . 
Braun is in this . Okay ? Look at me . I feel it in my gut . 
When has that ever been wrong ? You think I want to hurt you . What , are you crazy ? Of course not ! I just want the truth . That 's it ! 
About a man who could break us ? He 's not gonna break us and I 'll tell you why . 
Because you 're not gonna to let that happen and I 'm not gonna let that happen . 
Okay ? We have been through worse . Do you trust me ? Yes or no ? 
I always do , Jay . 
Just don 't make me regret it .
