You frightened my horse ! 
What are you doing here ? 
Okay , if you don 't have the tools to get through whatever it is you 're going through , then your sister kemi will provide , yes ? 
You really making me do this ? I am not sending you into a state of holy matrimony without some communication techniques . 
We communicate all day . About work . 
That 's easy ! 
You have to learn how to do the hard stuff , okay ? 
Look , I do not perform weddings unless I am damn sure there 's not gonna be divorce . 
Okay , that 's a little bit dramatic , don 't you think ? 
Like you storming out last night and not coming home for two hours ? 
Jay kicked me out of my own office to have a private conversation . Here we go ... Okay , okay . 
Okay , okay , okay , okay , okay . Let 's , let 's try moving closer together , knees touching . 
Come on ! Knees touching ! Let 's go ! All right , no need to wait for the wedding night . 
That 's what people do on their wedding night ? Okay , you 're being funny . 
Now hold hands . 
Now ... look at each other , and I want you to say what you 're most afraid of in this relationship . 
We 're doing this ? All right , fine . 
Look , me and Jay have gotten close . All right ? 
I like him , he 's my partner , but this you-and-Jay thing there is no " me and Jay " thing . 
I 'm just trying to keep you out of the inspector braun mess . 
Don 't you think that should be my choice ? 
It 's Helen . It 's urgent . I gotta go . 
It 's your day off ! 
There you go . And he 's gone . 
You wanna talk about what just happened there ? 
About Mike walking out again ? 
I let Jason chase a theory , and kept it from Mike . What was the theory ? 
It 's about Logan barlowe . 
The man who confessed to the car bomb ? 
Jay thinks that he took the fall for someone . 
- Will you do me a favor ? - Yeah . 
Will you look into barlowe 's financials for me , discreetly ? 
Sure , but Nikki Mike was just telling you how he felt . 
You and Jason ... it is a thing , and I 'm not saying it 's a bad thing , I 'm just saying that maybe you need to own it , because it keeps getting in the way . 
Right . 
- Hey ! I am so sorry to interrupt your day . 
I 'm sure you were doing something fun . Not that much . What do you got ? The thing is , c and I were at rehearsal , and rehearsal ? 
For our forensic a capella group , clues traveler . Clues traveler ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it 's a play on , never mind . 
Anyway , he wanted you to see this , but he had to take Rachel to the airport , and there was this problem with her suitcase , and yeah , I gotcha , I gotcha . 
What , what 'd you need me to see ? Right ! 
Murder victim . 
Apparently the cranial morphology means he 's white . 
Partial closure of the skull sutures says he was in his early 20s at time of death , about seven years ago . 
Did c get that from the bones ? No . There was some garbage under the remains , a receipt from 2017 . 
Trace evidence strikes again ! Early 20s . 
That 's a little young to start losing your teeth ? 
Exactly . Between that and mineral deposits in his bones , c thinks well-water consumption , which means he 's amish . 
A lot of them wear dentures from a young age . 
A young amish kid from seven years ago ? Yeah . 
Is that Jedidiah lapp ? 
That 's why it 's so urgent . 
They need DNA to confirm , but your name was on the file , so c wanted you to know right away . 
Yeah ... It 's my first case with mp ... 
His wife , Lucy , thought that he came to Philadelphia . I mean , I did what I could , but her community stonewalled me . 
Couple days later , my boss , he gives the case to Lancaster pd . 
He didn 't want to mess up our closure rate . 
It 's been bothering me ever since . I 'm sorry . 
Where were the remains found ? 
Construction site at center city , near the Delaware . 
All right . I 'll contact Lucy . 
I owe her that . Okay . 
It 's like the beginning of every bad horror movie . 
Fianc√© takes ex-husband out into the woods ... Two go in , one come out . Will you calm down ? 
Okay , it just confuses me , ' cause last time I checked , when a missing person ends up dead , homicide takes over , and then we go about our business ... other business . 
- Really ? - Yeah . ' Cause last I checked , that 's the exact opposite of what you 're doing with that car bomb case . 
Right . That 's different . 
Because I know that braun delivered a patsy to get me to stop digging , okay ? 
And I ... well , I know that because last night , I called the prison and I set up an interview with Logan barlowe . An interview about what ? 
Who cares ? I made something up . 
What difference does it make ? The point is , that was last night . This morning , I get an official reprimand . 
Wait . Braun dinged your jacket ? 
Some crap about insubordination . 
It just lets me know that I 'm onto something . 
You wanna know what it lets me know ? Is that braun is setting up a case to fire you . 
Reprimand is strike one , then it 'll be a suspension , and when you hit strike three , and we both know you will do something to hit strike three ... You 're out . 
I think it 's very sweet that you 're concerned about losing your partner . That touches me . 
Thank you . I 'm concerned that you keep putting Nikki in the middle of it . 
Anyway , tell me about the case , please , before I kill myself . 
That 's penn poultry farms . It 's a factory chicken operation . 
So we 're talking fowl play here . 
Are you done ? 
He 's an amish guy . His name 's Jedidiah lapp . 
Came into a ton of land when his parents died , but then he disappeared . 
Buggy was abandoned . Horse was miles away , but no jed . 
Okay , so how does penn poultry farms fit in ? 
His wife told me they were interested in buying the land . 
Said they were aggressive about it . 
Big agriculture 's not really your usual murder suspect . 
Well , it 's a theory . There 's no time to prove it . Couldn 't even prove foul play . 
Don 't say it . Shut up . 
Daed . These are officers from the Philadelphia police department . 
Do you remember Michael ? He tried to help us when Jedidiah went missing . 
I don 't care who they are . They don 't belong . 
O-Okay , Mr. Miller ... " Deacon . " 
Deacon ... W-We 're just here to offer you and your family some closure . 
Closure ? Did you find Jedidiah ? 
Remains were found last week at a center city construction site . 
We think it may be Jedidiah . 
I 'm sorry , Lucy . 
I know it 's a tough ask , but we 're gonna need a DNA sample to confirm . 
D-Do you have anything that he owned ? 
I mean , hair brush , or a piece of clothing ? 
How have you been , Michael ? 
I 'm good , thanks . 
He 's really good . 
H-He 's about to get married . 
- To my ex-wife . - Unimportant . 
I braided this for jed . 
It 's a summer hat he loved . No one has worn it since . 
That 's perfect , Lucy . 
You have what you need . 
Leave . 
I think , just my opinion , you should give yourself a break . Okay ? 
You came out here to her family shut me out again . 
I probably never mentioned that , but it 's a little bit of a trigger for me . 
A-ha . This about last night ? 
Look at you picking up on nuance . 
Lucy ? 
Liebchen ? I understand you 're grieving all over again , but we won 't eat supper without you . 
Lucy ? 
Amos ! Lucy 's gone ! Amos ! 
Jason , you 're killing me . 
Hey . Everything okay ? 
Yeah , I 'm fine . But forget what I said about looking into Logan barlowe . 
I 'm afraid someone 's watching . 
I assure you that kemi adebayo isn 't looking into anything . Okay . So this information that kemi adebayo didn 't look into , where are we ? 
Barlowe got two large wire transfers , one just after the car bomb he confessed to , and the source of the money is unclear , but I 'd have to be a little less discreet to get the information on the wires . 
So Jason 's right ? It 's a setup ? 
Yeah . He 's right to be curious . Yeah . 
Put a pin in it for now . 
Thank you . 
The elders , including my husband , were against my coming here . 
I don 't care how they punish me . 
I just want to bring my Lucy home . 
She never leaves our community , captain . 
She 's a simple girl , but has a ... a stubborn spirit . 
I 'm afraid for her . 
Is there anywhere that she might have gone that you know of ? 
I know that god 's ways cannot be understood and must be accepted , but I can not bear the thought of losing her the way we lost jed . 
Do you have a photograph of Lucy ? 
It would help our search . 
Photographs are a vanity , a violation of the second commandment . 
Right . I understand . 
Does that mean you can not help ? 
Photograph or not , we will find her . 
Yeah . Yeah , thanks anyway . 
What was that ? 
Lancaster pd 's got nothing . 
Lucy only left the community once , when she reported jed missing . 
Now I show up again and give bad news , and she disappears ? I don 't like it . 
Well , her mother said the same thing . 
But you said the father was a piece of work . 
Maybe she had enough and ran ? 
No , Lucy 's not impulsive . 
So either I opened up an old can of worms and she didn 't feel safe , or I made someone else nervous , and they grabbed her . 
You worked up about the case , or ... or us ? 
I don 't know . Both ? 
This case messed me up bad last time . 
It cost me a relationship . Just everything fell apart . Hey . 
We 're gonna be fine , Mike . 
Even if Lucy left voluntarily , I 'm the reason why someone who barely knows the world around their home ran away . 
She needs our help , Nik . 
Hey , I pulled a screen grab from your interview , when Lucy reported jed missing in 2017 . 
That 's all we need . 
- Issue the alert , statewide . - Got you . 
Ta-da ! " Ta-da . " what ... what does that mean ? 
I went through jed 's pockets . 
Mostly what you 'd expect , crushed seeds , sawdust ... but are you ready for this ? A wad of paper . 
Okay . What 's on it ? 
No idea . That 's ... that 's your big update ? 
I mean , it 's a thing pulling an impression off decomposed paper , but ... pull , I will . All right . 
Well ... If jed had this on him the night that he was killed , then maybe we can get the one that got away . 
Yeah . 
- Hey ... - Yeah ? We got a hit on the alert ? 
Dozens . She 's everywhere . 
We basically have sightings of every amish woman in Philadelphia . 
Turns out , most people don 't see past the clothing to the woman who wears them . 
So we got nothing ? 
I ran facial recognition , and I got a match to ... Cctv from a bus station in center city from last night . 
So she 's here in Philly ? 
Doesn 't look like she was taken . 
No , but she does looks scared . 
I mean , clearly she came all this way for a reason . The question is , what ? 
Hey , hey , Helen ! Hel ... hey , can you turn that down ? 
Not a pirates of penzance fan ? 
I get it . Gilbert and Sullivan isn 't for everyone . 
But this one is so romantic . 
I love a saucy tenor . I 'm sorry . 
I 'm just , you know , I 'm stressed about the case , wedding stuff the wedding ! Of course . 
By the way , congrats . 
I mean , not that I 'm invited , but I 'm really excited for you . 
Yeah , that . Well , you know , we made the guest list before you came on the team , so ... 
But , you reconstitute that paper , consider yourself invited . 
Challenge accepted ! 
I love weddings . And a workplace romance . 
Honestly ... I can 't imagine working with my s.O. 
Seems like a minefield . 
Don 't get me started . So , what do you make of it ? Check , please ! 
Looks like this was a check . 
Boy , that is a lot of zeroes . 
What would an amish farmer be doing with that kind of money ? That 's a good question . 
Can you zoom in on the name ? 
" Agritex sign a " 
agritex . Penn poultry farms ' parent company . 
Why would they give an amish guy this much money ? 
I mean , that 's a lot of quilts . 
Yeah , well , Lucy was right . They really wanted that land . 
Question is ... Bad enough to kill for it ? 
8th and market . That 's just a few blocks from the bus station where Lucy was last seen . Yes , it is . 
I 'm sorry . Without a warrant , you need a prior authorization . 
I can 't believe this is happening again . 
Mike , we 're gonna have to reconsider our investment . 
I-Investment ? But I-I thought you were detectives . 
We are detectives . 
Well , it 's technically " detective sergeant , " but h ... here 's the point . 
We represent the police pension fund , and if our money is not good enough for your supervisor 's time I mean , you know , then , we 'll have to take our money elsewhere . 
You ... why don 't you go tell your boss that ? 
Wait . Give me one second . - I 'll double-check . - Great ! 
Why you gotta lie to everybody ? 
Let me ask you a question . When 's the last time telling the truth got you what you actually wanted ? 
My batting average was pretty good before you started messing around . Your batting average ? Means you miss the ball 70 % of the time ? So your analogy proves you 're gonna talk baseball with the guy who played baseball ? I 'm just telling you . Are we having a problem , gentlemen ? 
No , no , no problem . Just a philosophical discussion . 
I 'm tilda Harvey , ceo of agritex . 
Sergeant Mike sherman , detective Jason Grant . 
- How do you do ? - I understand your union is looking to invest . 
It 's a little odd usually we 're approached through equity funds . 
Right , well , we are looking for direct investments in , in growth markets . 
In fact , do you have , any time for us in private , maybe ? 
Anything for the boys in blue . 
I hate him . So much . 
Have you , or any of your colleagues , come into contact with a woman named Lucy lapp ? 
I thought we were gonna discuss the f.O.P. Pension fund . 
Yeah , but you said " anything for the boys in blue , " and right now , the boys in blue wanna know where Lucy lapp is . 
What makes you think I know who this is ? 
Well ... well , because your subsidiary , penn poultry farms , tried to buy her husband 's land back in 2017 . 
A sale he was against . We think that he was gonna return the check to you , and then , he conveniently disappeared . 
Turns out he was murdered . His widow , Lucy , she was just seen around here , presumably coming to see you , and now she 's disappeared , so maybe you can help us explain that . 
I have no idea about any of this . 
Here we are . 
According to the file , when Mr. Lapp disappeared , and with his parents already deceased , the land went back to the community , as is their custom . 
We cut a second check because their Deacon sold their land to penn poultry farms . Really ? 
Would that be a Deacon Amos Miller ? 
That 's the one . 
He signed the paperwork and cashed the check . 
I 'm sorry you came all this way , but if the woman you 're looking for had a problem with the sale , she 's about seven years too late . 
Now , in 2017 , when I investigated jed 's disappearance , you didn 't mention that control of his family 's land was passed on to you . 
That thought was far away from my mind . 
And it did not pass to me . It passed to the community . 
As Deacon , it is my duty to manage transactions like this , but that is all . Okay . Let me be direct . 
Jed was killed for a reason ... And about two million of those reasons were in a check that you deposited . 
See , I think there 's a connection between jed 's death and Lucy 's disappearance , and that connection ... is you . 
I want to speak to my wife . 
His honor the Deacon isn 't giving up anything . 
Speaking of giving up you were cc 'd on the reprimand ? 
What am I gonna do ? Braun 's coming after me . 
I know that it 's a warning , and I know that you don 't care , okay ? That scares me , Jay . 
You keep pushing , I 'm not gonna be able to save you . 
Well , I-I didn 't ask you to save me . That 's not what I 'm asking for , okay ? 
If there 's a target on my back , there 's a target on my back . What if it puts a target on all of our backs ? 
Then we can do the right thing , or we can do the easy thing . 
It 's your call . Is it ? 
No , I was being polite . Did it work out ? 
Yep , he knows something , but he only wants to talk to his wife . 
Probably scold her for coming here in the first place . 
What do we do ? Let him stew ? 
No , bring in wifey , let ' em get into a fight , and maybe we 'll hear something we want to hear . 
Yeah , he 's right . 
Give the Deacon what he wants . 
All right . Your wife 's here . You got what you wanted . 
Now we need answers . Okay ? 
We need to try to find Lucy . 
Before you came to our home , Lucy was fine . 
Is always this way for us . 
The English come , and we suffer ... Just like those poor children at the schoolhouse . 
Yeah , I remember that case . 
Five children dead , community attended the shooter 's funeral . 
Our worlds are different . 
We may forgive , but we do not forget . 
Okay , well , don 't forget that I 'm just trying to help your daughter . 
Amos . I will take care of my own family . 
Listen . It 's too late for that . 
Your wife already reported Lucy missing . 
Now , we know she 's in Philadelphia . 
If she wasn 't running from somebody , maybe she was running to someone . 
Is there somebody in Philly she knows ? Somebody she would come to see ? 
No . 
Please , Amos ! Michael is trying to help . 
Hey , Deacon Miller . Lucy might be in trouble , okay ? I 'm just trying to help . 
We 're going home . 
Well , I 'm glad you figured something out , because there is no way in hell that anybody in this office speaks Pennsylvania Dutch . 
I 've always wanted to learn it . It 's a palatine German dialect , and , you know , your girl took a little bit of German . 
Hey , you thinking of breakin ' amish ? 
No , but contrary to popular belief , there are some black amish , thank you . 
But I did build a translate function into our platform . Take a look at this . 
All right , so it looks like Miriam thinks that Lucy came out to see someone named Ezekiel . Apparently , he was excommunicated at some point . 
So how do we find Ezekiel ? 
Lucy . 
Guder daag . Wow . It 's you . 
I don 't understand the addresses . 
I 've been searching for your home for hours . 
May I come inside ? 
Of course . 
Please . Sit . 
Can I ... can I get you something ? Water ? 
No . Thank you . 
I 'm sorry I haven 't written in a while . 
Your letters got me through dark times . 
I should have sent more . 
I read each one a thousand times . 
And now ... you 're here . All the better . 
What 's wrong ? 
Zeke ... I came to tell you that they found him . 
Jed ? 
They found jed ? 
They found his body . 
Blessed be the father of mercies who comforts us in all our affliction ... That we may comfort those who are in any affliction ... Through which we , ourselves , are comforted by god . 
Excuse me , please . 
Anything ? 
Since the amish keep their own birth records , and they don 't have driver 's licenses , there 's only one government record available . 
Social security ? 
Sort of . It 's form 4029 . 
So , no one 's actually obligated to get a social security number , so old-order amish usually decline them , but to do that , so at least we have a haystack to look for our needle . 
There 's gotta be a dozen ezekiels in Lancaster county . Yeah . Any approximate age ? 
According to c , he was 22 at the age of death , which means he 'd be about 29 today , same age as Lucy . 
Maybe they grew up together . 
Let 's try forms submitted from 1992 ... To 2000 , for a little bit of a buffer . Let 's see . 
Mike ? 
What ? There 's an Ezekiel lapp that was submitted August 1995 by Leonard and Elizabeth lapp , jed 's parents . 
Son of a bitch . They lied to me . They didn 't tell me jed had a brother . 
It was that same officer I spoke to when jed disappeared . 
You spoke to the police ? 
To Michael sherman . He told me they found jed 's body . 
What do they know ? 
What do you mean ? Who are they after ? Did they say ? 
" After " ? 
Zeke , why are you ... do they know you 're here ? 
I 'm sorry I upset you . Maybe I should go . 
Do the police know that you are here ? 
Nobody knows I 'm here . 
Lucy , I ... I love you . 
I never stopped loving you . 
Hey , what do you got ? 
Great timing . 
Looks like I may have something for you . 
Vmd ? 
What is that ? 
Vacuum metal deposition , baby , Helen park style , supercharged ! 
Anyway , because there was blood on jed 's clothing , I was able to pull a partial print . All right , great . Can you run it through the database ? Already on it . And ... bingo . 
The print matches an Ezekiel lapp . 
Jed 's brother . 
He 's in the system for a 2019 assault charge . 
All right . We gotta find this guy , quick . 
He got a driver 's license in January 2017 . 
Are you sure ? I mean , these amish are old-school , so he probably wouldn 't drive . Says he got it right here in lawndale . 
That 's months before jed was murdered . 
He must 've left the community . 
That 's why they didn 't mention him . What if Lucy came here to see the man who killed her husband ? 
Okay , so patrol checked the address on Ezekiel 's license . 
He moved out two years ago . 
Which means he could be anywhere , and he probably has Lucy . 
Hey ! This is just a peace offering . 
I might have somebody who can help us find Zeke . 
Lady named Leah . 
She 's an amish gal , and , I-I might have dated her . 
An amish woman , Jay ? Seriously ? Well , I didn 't know she was amish at the time , at first , you know ? 
She was doing her ... what do you call it ? The thing with the rump ... rumpshaker , rump ... ? 
" Rumspringa . " 
Rumspringa . That 's right . Sow your oats , see the world , decide if you wanna go back . 
It 's like a get-out-of-jail-free card . 
Yeah , okay , but you 're usually a teenager when you do that . 
Right , but she wasn 't a teenager , Mike . 
She was 23 years old . - That 's better . 
- All right , all right , all right , all right ! For the love of god , just get to the point . 
Right , I ran into her recently , and she 's running this group for , the ex-amish , whatever that means , and , she ... she can help us . 
I , just , I don 't think she 's gonna be very happy to see me . Might be a little awkward . Yeah . Just do it . 
- I 'm doing it . - Okay . 
Sure you don 't want to wait in the car ? 
There is a zero-percent chance I 'm missing this . 
It 's really not that big a deal . We went on a couple dates . 
You broke an amish heart . Admit it . Shh . 
Hi . 
Hello , Jason . 
Very good to see you . Thanks for having us . 
This is my partner , Mike . Hey . 
Well , thanks for helping us out . 
We think that somebody from your former community might be in danger . 
And not from him ? 
I like you . I like her . 
Actually , you were the perfect introduction to the real world . 
You see ? Yeah , I learned what " ghosting " meant . I didn 't ghost you . All right , now that we got the awkwardness out of the way , we were wondering if you know who this was . 
His name 's Ezekiel lapp . 
That 's his driver 's license . 
Guys , there 's 87,000 amish people in Pennsylvania . 
That 's a lot of felt hats . 
It 's a joke ! Nobody 's got a sense of humor ? I 'm kidding . 
Look , I 'm sorry , I don 't know him , but I take it from the driver 's license he left the community , which , by the way , isn 't easy , even if you don 't happen to meet Jason Grant . 
So , I guess we 're out of luck ? Maybe ... 
I ... have a friend who helps a lot of us find jobs , apartments . 
Could you maybe , reach out to him , ' cause we really gotta find this guy . Please , please ? Did he do something , or did someone do something to him ? I don 't know . 
Which answer gets us the info we 're looking for ? 
I 'll do it . But only because you were my first . Really ? 
First phone number . 
You never forget your first . What , husband ? 
I 've noticed . 
Okay , just speak on it , please , already . 
Look , I know that you and Nikki are up to something , okay ? And I 've repeatedly asked you to not do what ? 
I don 't know . If you want to sabotage yourself with braun , be my guest . Okay ? But I 'm asking you for the last time leave Nikki out of it . 
Gotcha . 
You done ? - Yeah . - Hey ! Zeke . Your guy , Ezekiel , goes by " Zeke . " 
My friend does know him . He got him a job at penn poultry farms . 
He also put him in touch with the landlord at this place . 
Thank you very much . It 's very good to see you . 
I will call me ? 
Don 't . Gotcha . You look great . 
Ezekiel lapp ! 
Here we go . 
- Ready ? - Yeah . 
Clear . 
Clear . 
He 's gone . 
Lucy was here . 
How do you know that ? 
' Cause this blanket right here , it 's only done in one spot , like she was messing with it , and it 's the same weave from the hat that she made for jed . 
Check this out . 
He 's obsessed with her . Got a whole box of these . 
Imagine he wasn 't too thrilled when she married his brother . 
Sure as hell gives us a motive for the murder . 
Right . So , she walks through this door ... Tells a murderer that we found the victim , what does that tell you ? 
She 's in trouble . 
We gotta find her , quick . 
We 'll go some place ... Some place where we can be together . 
Maybe Canada ? Hey ? You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? 
I like you , Zeke , but I 'm not ready to it was a mistake , Lucy ! 
What was a mistake ? Jed ! 
He waited until my rumspringa to propose . 
That 's why I stayed away , because I couldn 't come back , and then when ... and then when you got married , I was ... I was angry , but I wanted to look him in the eye , and see why he did that , when he knew how I felt about you ! 
What happened , Zeke ? 
I went to see him after work , but all that anger , there was no talking . 
There was ... Pushing , and ... He fell , and he hit his head . 
Look , I didn 't mean to hurt him . I ... 
I 'd lost you already ! And my home ! I ... 
Panicked , and I hid the body . 
You sinned . And then you lied about it . 
If I had turned myself in , you never would have forgiven me ! 
I would have . 
Do you remember how we used to sit across from each other at singing ? 
Of course . 
It 's good to hear you sing again . 
Maybe we can start over . Be together . 
You mean it ? 
But we would need money , and we both know where to find it ... my father . 
Ezekiel was in love with Lucy , but she chose his brother ? 
It 's all very Francesca da rimini . 
She was betrothed to this noble , gianciotto di malatesta , fell in love with his brother , and then gianciotto killed them both . Luckily , not one of my past lives . 
That doesn 't really help , kemi . 
- We have an expired license . - Yeah . He never registered a vehicle with the dmv . 
But ... You can 't get too far in Pennsylvania without an ... - What ? - Ez-pass . Jackpot . 
We have an active account registered under Zeke 's old license . Come on . 
We need a break . Mike needs a break here . Come on . 
Wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . 
It was used ten minutes ago on the westbound i-76 toll road . 
They 're headed back to amish country . 
He 's driving a blue hatchback . Got it . 
Well , this is obviously a rhetorical question , but why would Zeke be going back to the people who shunned him ? Right ? He kills his own brother . 
What , do you think he 's just dropping Lucy off at home ? 
Best case , Lucy got in his head , she 's buying time . 
And worst case , she doesn 't make it out of this thing alive . Look . There 's the hatchback . 
Go easy . Don 't get too close . We need confirmation that Lucy 's in the car . 
All right , someone 's definitely in the passenger seat . 
Is it her ? 
It 's her ! 
How many cars you been through this year ? You 're not helping ! 
Let me out ! Stop ! 
Please , Zeke . You 're scaring me . 
Nikki ! Hey , we need Lancaster pd . He 's getting away . 
No , he 's not ! 
Seriously ? 
Yeah ? Well , they abandoned the car . 
The only thing around here is a barn . - Yeah , all right . - I see it . I 'm coming as fast as I can . Don 't wait for me ! 
It 's the police ! You knew they 'd find us here . 
You tricked me ! I didn 't ! I swear . Please , Zeke . Don 't do this . 
You said you wanted to be together ! I was scared ! 
Zeke , don 't do this ! 
I 've waited seven years . 
Zeke ! Hey ! Philly pd . I need you to come down , nice and calm . 
I won 't hurt her . 
Just let us go . Can 't do that . Look . 
Why don 't you drop the weapon , okay ? I know you love her . 
That 's not what you do to people you love . Put it down . 
No ! 
Hands behind your back . 
You 're under arrest for the murder of Jedidiah lapp . 
Don 't move . Hey . 
The , the horse ... that was for you . 
I know you needed a win . We good now ? Yeah . We 're good . 
Heard you 're vying for the mounted patrol . 
Yeah , yeah . I think that was a one-time thing . 
My ass is killing me . 
What 's the matter ? 
You okay ? Nikki had me dig into Logan barlowe . 
And ? He has a life insurance policy ... A massive payout for his family . 
What 's convenient is that the policy was taken out two days before his confession . Right . 
The guy 's terminally ill . 
Yep . No insurance company is writing that policy . 
Not without the pressure of someone powerful . Yeah . 
Like maybe a , well-connected police inspector ? 
What else is bugging you ? 
" Unauthorized use of department resources for personal matters . " Personal matters ? 
You know , I 've worked law enforcement for over a decade , and not one blemish . 
I 'm sorry . Yeah . 
I 'm a big girl . I made a choice , so ... 
Look , this hunt ? We better get it right , Jason , or braun is gonna burn us all down . 
Thank you both again . 
We won 't forget your kindness . 
I can 't believe the Deacon invited us . I thought he hated mp ... 
Well , these people are experts at forgiveness . 
Maybe we could learn something . 
Yeah , I want to apologize for how I 've been acting . 
You let me bring Lucy the news , you put out the alert when we weren 't sure ... You had my back the whole way . You were right . 
Well , I didn 't know that . 
It was just my gut . Like Jay and the braun thing . 
And what 's between me and Jay , that 's for life . I gotta own that . But it doesn 't mean I love you any less . I know . 
But from now on , we communicate . Deal ? Deal . 
You know , I don 't want to be too forward , but I think our knees just touched . 
You better save some for the wedding night , you animal . 
You wanna stop for a pretzel ?
