It 's locked again . 
Give me a minute . 
I 'll open it in no time . 
We walked quite a bit already , so maybe we can call it a day soon . 
You sure are clever , Marcille , answering with your stomach . 
It wasn 't me ! 
It 's completely normal . 
After all , we 've only had snacks today . 
But Laios , I 'm against taking a break . 
The only foodstuff we found today was a bowl full of Treasure Bugs . 
Even if we have to push ourselves , we should make for the fourth floor . 
Still , the monsters will get tougher and tougher the further we go . 
I think we should conserve our energy . 
But even if we save our energy , it won 't matter if we pass out from hunger . 
But without energy , we wouldn 't be able to defeat monsters ... 
It 's open . 
This room looks like it used to be a dining hall . 
This must 've been a luxurious dining table once upon a time . 
But now , it 's just the dead haunting this place . 
There 's not even a single rat in here . 
I 'm not eating a rat , okay ? 
I wonder why it 's always dead humans who attack us . 
Can 't a whole roasted pig come after us for a change ? 
Don 't be silly . 
" Come after us " ... 
But we do have ... food coming after us ! 
Living Painting ? 
Watch it , Laios ! 
You got too close ! 
You could 've gotten sucked in ! 
That 's what I wanted ! 
I was just getting to the good part ! 
What ? 
There were grapes in that painting . 
In other words , you were trying to eat the food in the painting . 
That 's right . Pretty neat idea , don 't you think ? 
- Absolutely not ! 
- You moron ! 
- Moron ! What were you thinking ? 
- Ever heard the saying , " pie in the sky " ? 
I-I know you can 't actually eat a pie in the sky . But a painting of someone eating a pie in the sky works ! 
You 'll end up getting killed inside the painting . 
Precisely ! 
Inside the painting , we should be able to interact with each other ! 
Fine . Have it your way , then . 
But you can only give it a try once . 
We 'll tie a rope around you . 
If you give us a signal , we 'll pull you out . 
Which painting should I go for ? 
This one looks pretty good . 
There 's a lot of delicious food in it . 
All right , I 'll go for this painting . 
Ow . 
Hey , you . 
I 've already been spotted ! 
That sword ... 
You 're wearing odd armor , but you 're one of the castle guards , aren 't you ? 
Here , carry this . 
Seriously , we 're always running short on hands . 
This way ! Don 't space out ! 
Look at his face . He looks so clever ! 
Yes , the shape of his nose is just like yours . 
He will lead the kingdom splendidly one day . 
- There , there . You 're a good boy . - Congratulations , Your Majesty . 
Stop daydreaming ! 
Bring the next plate already ! 
- Um , could I have a bite ... 
- I have it ! 
Delgal ! 
Your name is Delgal ! 
Delgal , you 'll become a great king ! 
This is no good ! 
There 's no chance of me eating anything ! 
Help me out ! 
It 's his signal ! 
Pull ! 
How was it ? 
I was so close to getting a bite . But the vibe just wasn 't right . 
- The vibe ? 
- That 's what stopped you ? 
Yeah , it was totally the vibe . 
One more time ! 
I can grab a bite if the situation is more suitable . 
What do you mean by " suitable " ? 
Let 's see . 
I guess it needs to be more casual . 
Casual ? 
How about this one ? 
They have fancy food , it looks like a party , and there 's even someone dancing naked . 
This is it ! Here I go ! 
You drunk fool ! 
What do you think you 're doing in front of the king ? 
Get down from the table now ! 
Oh , stop it . 
Today is my wedding day . 
Pardon this man for getting a little too carried away . 
But Prince Delgal ... 
Delgal ? 
Is he the baby in the painting earlier ? 
Come on , go ! 
That was a close call ! 
Delgal ! 
Father ! 
I am glad to see how splendidly you have grown . 
To the future of this kingdom . 
F-Father ! 
He was poisoned ! 
Guess I 'll take some back with me and enjoy them quietly later . 
Sorry . 
Your Majesty ! 
Treat him now ! 
Hurry ! 
That elf , I spotted him in the previous painting as well . 
I wonder if he 's a jester or something . 
Look what I 've got ! 
I brought back food this time ... 
Wait , what ? 
It 's all gone ! 
So I can 't take food out of the painting . 
The only way is to eat them inside the painting ! 
Again ! 
Now that it 's come to this , I must have a taste of the food ! 
FULL-COURSE OF COURT CUISINE 
Is this a crowning ceremony ? 
So that prince succeeded to the throne . 
May this kingdom and its people flourish for eternity . 
It 's good ! 
It 's good ! 
I thought it might taste like paint , but this is a real feast ! 
Seconds , please . 
I sure ate a ton . 
I 'm stuffed . 
Guess I 'll go back now . 
Huh ? 
This is ... 
- You don 't belong to this castle . 
- Damn ! 
What are you doing ? 
You were there when the prince was born and also at his wedding . 
What is your purpose ? 
Are you after the throne ? 
I 'll reduce you to ashes right now ! 
The painting ! 
Did something happen inside the painting ? 
There were tons of mouthwatering dishes . 
As I was about to leave after eating my fill , someone realized I was an outsider , grabbed me by the collar , and got really mad . 
I 'm not surprised . 
I was so scared . 
Now that I 'm relaxed , I 'm starting to feel hungry again . 
Wait , what ? 
Even though I ate a lot , my stomach still feels empty ! 
What did we tell you ? 
It was just a pie in the sky ! 
You wasted our time ! 
But it really tasted good ! 
Was this the kitchen ? 
We can collect water from the room next door , and it 's a nice spot to rest for a bit . 
If you hadn 't fooled around with the paintings , we probably could 've reached the fourth floor by now . 
Is that a Mimic ? 
I 've never noticed that box there before . 
It 's not super obvious , but it 's not exactly hidden , either . 
It 's positioned in a way that catches your eye . 
It 's in a spot those bastards are fond of . 
So , let 's get some shut-eye here today . 
Okay . 
You good with that , Chilchuck ? 
Sure . 
I suppose I don 't have to tell them . 
I just know Senshi and Laios will insist on eating it . 
Then , it 'll be up to me to open the box . 
Mimics ... 
I 've lost count of the times those bastards have caused me misery ! 
All right ! 
It doesn 't have a lock or a trap ! 
Since this was locked , it 's not a Mimic ! 
If I open it from behind , it shouldn 't be able to hurt me ! 
Dammit ! 
I forgot about the trap ! 
Damn Mimics ! 
You okay ? 
You seemed lost in thought . 
Is something bothering you ? 
No , not really . 
You must be tired . 
You 're still a child , after all . 
Let him have a good night 's sleep without having to stand guard . 
Like I said , I 'm not a kid ! 
So , how old are you ? 
I 'd rather not say . 
There you go again . You 're always like that . 
You won 't even tell us your hometown or your birthday . 
I prefer to keep my job and personal life in separate lanes . 
One of these days , you 'll miss out if you keep acting that way . 
Sure , whatever . 
I 've become more sensitive to hunger . 
I used to be fine without food for two days . 
I 'll go and fetch some water from the next room . 
Hey , slowpoke . 
I 'm going to draw some water . 
I 'll go with you . 
Don 't bother . I 'll be right back . 
It 's dangerous . 
It 's just the next room . 
A Coin Bug . 
I wonder if there 's a nest nearby . 
If I can find a few more , it might help ease our hunger . 
Not to sound like Laios , but I kinda like Coin Bugs . 
They 're monsters that camouflage like Mimics , but they 're cute . 
Hey ! 
Wait a minute , that 's where the Mimic ... 
You idiot . 
You forgot you 're heavier with the water bag . 
There should be a mechanism nearby to open this door . 
Of course , it 's out of reach . 
Should I call for help ? 
If my yelling attracts more monsters , it will put my friends in danger . 
Don 't worry . 
If I don 't return , Marcille will notice . 
Will she ? 
No , she probably won 't . 
I can 't count on her ! 
Don 't panic ! 
Opening closed doors is your job , isn 't it ? 
This type of door opens once you figure out its mechanism . 
I 'll be safe as long as I don 't touch the Mimic . 
I don 't hear any strange device making noise , so there 's no time limit , either . 
There are a couple of buttons on the wall and a mechanism that likely triggers spears to pop up . 
If I press the buttons in the wrong order , they probably spring up . 
And the text on this plate is likely the key , but ... It 's in some ancient language , and I can 't make heads or tails of it . 
Darn it , if only Marcille were around . 
But it seems strangely familiar ... 
Nah , I should get my thoughts in order first . 
There are three buttons in the corners of the room . 
Why three ? 
Do I need to press them in a specific sequence ? 
There 's a button behind the Mimic as well ! 
Darn it ! 
That bastard is set on hindering me at every turn ! 
Could there be a hint inside the room ? 
Of course not . 
Even if I press the buttons randomly , I 'll only end up getting skewered . 
But since I 'm small , maybe I could dodge them . 
Nah , it 's too risky . 
Ugh , I have no idea what to do ! 
Maybe I should just stay still until dawn ... 
You were in here ? ! 
Darn ... 
I-I was saved ... 
You sure are tough ! 
Mimics are cute when you turn them over , and they wiggle their legs . 
You can tell their sex by turning them over . 
Laios ' useless trivia is coming back to me one after another ! 
Turn them over ? 
As if that 's possible ! 
Here goes nothing ! 
Ow . 
I wonder if they 're on their way to help me after all that commotion . 
So this one was empty ? 
How dare you mock me like that ! Huh ? 
This text ... 
So this is what was written on the plate ! 
In that case , I know what it says ! 
Hurry ! 
- East ! 
- No matter how many times the sun rises ... 
- West ! 
- And the moon sinks ... 
- North ! - Like the unmoving stars ... 
South ! 
May the wind of fortune forever blow your way ! 
It opened ! 
Chilchuck isn 't coming back ! 
C-Chilchuck ! 
I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry ! 
I 'm alive , okay ? 
What 's this ? 
Did you do this , Chilchuck ? 
Well done ! 
Sure . 
What a fine Mimic . 
A Mimic , huh ? 
It 's going to be my first time cooking it . 
Don 't try to eat it as if it 's the normal thing to do ! 
Don 't worry , Marcille . 
Mimics on their own aren 't poisonous . 
They can be toxic depending on their diet , but if you remove their digestive organs , it should be safe . 
How is that supposed to be safe ? 
Forget it , Marcille . 
There 's no point in telling them not to . 
But today , I won 't eat it , no matter what ! 
Boil plenty of water , add some salt . 
Place the Mimic inside , cover it with a lid , and wait a while . 
When it 's boiled enough , it 's done ! 
BOILED MIMIC 
It 's hard to scoop out the meat . 
How about using the handle instead ? 
It 's no good . I 'm only pushing it deeper inside . 
Right . 
Chilchuck , let me use those things . 
Those things ? 
You know , the picking tools you 're always carrying around . 
Picking tools . 
A-Are you out of your mind ? 
It should be fine if we disinfect them in boiling water . 
That 's not the problem ! 
D-Don 't ! 
It 's easy to scoop now ! 
Here . 
It 's really good . 
This is really tasty . 
I bet it would be delicious to eat the back meat and leg meat together . 
It wasn 't as good as I thought . 
They say the digestive gland of hermit crabs tastes bad . 
But why didn 't you tell us about the Mimic ? 
I have unpleasant memories associated with Mimics . 
Ideally , I 'd like to steer clear of them entirely . 
Anyway , I 've made quite a few errors in judgment . 
I panicked thinking it might eat the Treasure Bug . 
Mimics don 't eat Treasure Bugs . What ? 
On the contrary , Treasure Bugs feed on Mimics . 
When they find a Mimic , they enter the box through the crack and lay their eggs . 
And the larvae that hatch inside the box grow as they consume the Mimic . 
Once they become adult insects , they 're often confused for treasure by humans , and they take flight to begin their next phase of life . 
Are you kidding me ? 
Cut it out , will you ? 
That 's what you get for not telling me your age . 
Didn 't you learn that you can miss out when you keep secrets from your friends ? 
Come on , tell me how old you are ! 
Th ... " Th ... " ? 
This year , I turn 29 . 
So you really are a kid . How boring ! 
I didn 't know you were so young . 
Well , why don 't you tell me your ages , then ! 
This is what I hate about long-lived races ! 
What ? 
Um , Mister ... Chilchuck ... 
Stop it ! 
Today , you feast on a monster , but tomorrow , you could end up as someone 's meal . 
Dungeon food . 
Oh , dungeon food .
