Thank you . 
The floor 's slippery . Careful . 
It 's fine . You don 't have to . 
I told you not to move ! 
What are you doing ? 
It 's fine . 
The doctors were just worried . I don 't need all that . 
The smart doctors know what they 're doing . Listen to them . 
Don 't do anything on your own from now on , okay ? 
You don 't listen . 
Are you hungry ? 
What are you doing ? 
Let 's just stay like this . 
When I thought it was the end , I regretted it so much . 
I was given another chance but wasn 't honest again . 
You won 't die . 
I 'm sorry I didn 't believe you . 
No , I 'm sorry . 
Yu-ra isn 't an easy opponent . 
Even after I saw her unimaginable true colors , it took over three years to end it with her . 
Someone being beyond your imagination ... 
I know what you mean . 
When you spend a long time with someone , it 's hard to see that person properly . 
You try not to believe it . 
You only realize it after you see the end . 
Your ex-fianc√©e is trying to kill me , and Min-hwan and Su-min get paid if I die . 
They joined forces . 
Ms. Yang 's husband 's having an affair . 
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang . 
It 's not over with their marriage . 
There 's something more . I have to find that out . To protect Ms. Yang . 
Just stay by my side . 
Wait for me . 
The police think a drunk driver caused the accident . 
They 'll never catch her . 
We put someone on Yu-ra , Min-hwan , and Su-min . But we haven 't caught anything yet . 
We put people on them after the accident , so there 's no lead . 
If you knew in advance , you should 've discussed it with me first . 
I wasn 't sure that you were on my side . 
I 'm sorry , Seok-jun . 
Don 't . I 'm not that angry . 
The only way is to find Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk . 
They must be heading for Incheon . 
And Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them . 
I 'm sure . 
It 's a matter of who 's faster . 
By the way , how long do you have to wear the sling ? 
Until Ji-won tells me to stop wearing it . 
Honestly , I can take it off now . But she promised to take care of me while I had it on . 
Ji-hyuk . Do you remember anything more from the accident ? 
Not really . 
I went to the memorial hall to see you . The car broke down there . 
Is that all ? 
Maybe not , but I can 't think of anything right now . 
- Ji-won ? - Yeah ? 
- Eggs . - Okay . 
What else ? 
I should go . I 'll see you tomorrow . 
Thanks for today . 
What 's wrong ? 
Ji-won . 
Does it hurt again ? 
I 'm sorry . 
It 's the only thing I could think of . 
I can 't believe you . 
Can you stay the night ? 
Good night . 
I 'll get the light . 
Mr. Yu , what are you doing ? 
I understand what you mean , so I 'll just hold you . 
It still hurts . I swear . 
Always be by my side . 
No matter what you do , do it by my side . 
That 's all I need . 
Are you up ? 
I was going to wake you . 
Do you want strawberries ? It 's so good . It 's the yummiest I 've had ... 
What ? 
Did you have a nightmare ? 
Wait . Does your arm not hurt ? Is it okay now ? 
It hurts . 
No , you were just ... 
Wow . You know how to lie now . 
It 's true . 
What did you dream about ? 
It 's a secret . 
I know we 're both assistant managers , but I 'm acting manager , so I have to say this . 
You take a day off too often , as if you 're part of the owner 's family . 
I had some issues at home . 
You did ? 
Is there anyone here who doesn 't have a home ? 
Is there anyone here who doesn 't have issues at home ? 
Darn it . Why did the personnel decision have to be made now ? 
That jerk is just so lucky . 
There 's so much work piling up around us ... 
Unbelievable . 
Shall I help ? 
- Ms. Yang ! - Ms. Yang ! 
Is it okay to work now ? 
- Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm okay . 
What ? 
What are you doing ? Why couldn 't I reach you ? 
Kang Ji-won came to work as if nothing happened . 
What the hell is going on ? 
Ji-hyuk 's been discharged . That must be why . 
I told you to act like nothing happened . 
What do you think she 'll do ? 
It 's easy to pull her hair and yell if you want to fight . 
Be patient if you don 't want to live like a bum . 
Will you come to the gym later ? 
You 'll feel better after we talk while working out . 
This brat is so rude . 
I shouldn 't get involved with such low-standard people , but nothing gets done if I don 't do it myself . 
We found Man-sik and Hui-suk . They were scared , so they tried to hide . 
Hello , it 's Jeong Man-sik . 
It was hard to find you . 
Why did you hide ? We 're in the same boat . 
No , it 's not because we couldn 't trust you . We can 't trust my daughter . 
Just trust me now . 
I never abandon my family . 
How about going to China for a while ? 
Shanghai is beautiful . 
You can also have some fun in the water in Hangzhou and Suzhou . 
Aren 't I pathetic ? 
At this age , when I feel anxious , I have nowhere to go but work . 
Because you have friends here . 
I was worried and going to go see you anyway . 
No , I 'm barging in tonight . 
I reported it to the police for adultery . 
Right . This was before the law was abolished . 
Whenever I was admitted to the hospital , he brought her home . 
So I told him I was being admitted today . 
His car dashcam caught them doing dirty things in the car . 
But there 's no video . I think it 's broken . 
And the police said audio wasn 't enough proof . 
The dashcam video 's not working ? 
Ridiculous , right ? 
I really didn 't want to go this far , but I made up my mind and broke the door lock on my way out . 
Ms. Yang . Can I come with you ? 
Is that her ? Yes . 
Okay , your husband went in 30 minutes ago . 
Let 's go in 10 minutes . 
Who are you people ? 
What ? What is it ? 
What 's going on ? 
What ? 
Hey . 
Why are you here at this hour ? 
What ? 
He said you were in the hospital . I came to give him some side dishes . 
Maybe I was out of line . 
I see him at the restaurant often , so I considered him family . 
Hey . 
Did you suspect me ? 
Do you look down on me since I work for your dad ? 
- You two ... - What ? What is it ? 
Whatever . 
Forget it . Just leave , all of you . 
Get out . Hey , you too . 
Don 't bring anything here saying you 're worried . 
Wow , you 're making a joke of me . 
I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . 
Get out . 
You should go too . I 'll talk to him . 
You 're not leaving ? 
I 'm leaving , but before I go ... 
What ? What are you doing ? 
What ? 
If you touch her , I 'll make you pay ! 
You 're crazy ! 
I 'm going to charge you for this ! 
You came with the cops ! 
Sir , this ... 
Isn 't this property damage ? 
This woman used the golf club ... 
Stop it ! 
You 're so shameless . 
Are you happy you weren 't caught ? 
No , I know what you did in the car . 
What ? You wonder how much insurance money you 'll get if I die ? 
You laughed about it . Are you two even human ? 
What ? 
That 's the car Yeon-ji rides . 
Aren 't you ashamed ? 
You 're a terrible person . 
What are you saying ? 
You don 't even have any proof . 
Hey , that 's ... 
Why you ... 
Are you okay ? 
No , don 't . 
You crazy bastard ! 
No , wait ! You can 't do this . 
- Hold her tight . - Please calm down . Hold her . 
Calm down . Please . You can 't do this . 
Are you okay , Ji-won ? 
I 'll come back after work tomorrow . Don 't do anything until then . 
Thanks , Ji-won . 
But it 's my business , so I 'll handle it by myself . 
I realized earlier . I don 't think he 'll break up that easily . 
So I 'll see a lawyer . 
No ... 
Don 't ever meet him alone . 
Just call me . I 'll come . 
Why are you saying such strange things ? 
You 're acting weird . 
I know that . 
But you would 've gotten hurt badly if it weren 't for me earlier . 
Just do as I say this once . 
I 'll be by your side . 
You said you 'd meet a lawyer . 
You can talk with me . 
Ms. Yang can trust Mr. Lee . 
He always does what he says . 
My fate going to someone else ... I don 't think it 's a coincidence . 
If the stress from her indifferent husband caused her cancer , where did the fate of being killed by him come from ? 
The broken door lock . 
The red high heels . 
And the candy tin . 
Husband having an affair with someone close ... 
Or are those scumbags after the insurance money ? 
I 'll take care of you when my wife dies . 
I know what I have to do . 
Ji-hyuk , I have to seduce Min-hwan . 
Because Min-hwan must have an affair and not care if his wife dies . 
No , I have to make him think that he needs to kill her . 
I know it 'll upset you , but I have to do it . 
If I don 't give the fate of being killed by a cheating husband to Su-min , Ms. Yang will die . 
Can I do this ? 
Okay . 
Do whatever you want . 
I 'll help you . 
- Mr. Kim . - Yes , sir ? 
You take over the meal kit project . 
Pardon ? 
But the person in charge is ... 
You joined the team . You need a project of your own . 
You can do it , right ? 
I want you all to help . 
This isn 't right , Mr. Yu ! 
You chose money over me . Did you not see this coming ? 
You can 't have it both ways , Ji-won . 
Fine . I 'll find a new job . 
In return , let me finish the meal kit project . 
This project belongs to Ms. Yang and me . 
It belongs to the company . 
Don 't let personal matters ... 
I gave you the meal kit project because of my personal feelings . 
I don 't want to see you . Take the day off . 
Resigning would be better . 
She took the money and broke up with him ? 
Forget it . 
Why are you doing this alone ? 
What ? 
My position turned to crap because of someone . 
As I said before , none of this would 've happened if you didn 't see Su-min . 
Don 't be ridiculous . 
You screwed me over to switch to Mr. Yu . 
You 're right . 
But the situation has changed . 
Do you want to have a drink with me later ? 
Eighty billion won ? 
The chairman said he 'd gladly pay me that much if I broke up with him . 
Of course , it 's not all cash . 
There 's real estate too . 
He took care of all the taxes too . 
So I don 't even know how much I have . 
An asset manager ? I have that too . 
Mr. Yu is pretty angry with me for taking money from the chairman . 
But what else was I supposed to do ? 
It makes sense . 
No matter how rich he is , it 'd be strange to just give her that much . 
But if it 's under the condition that she stops seeing him , that makes more sense . 
Still , that 's a lot ... 
JEONG SU-MIN , JI-WON 'S FRIEND Why does she have to call now ? 
What is it ? 
Shouldn 't you be at home at this hour ? 
I know you 're busy . Thanks for making time for me . 
I 've wanted to see you . 
When I saw you last time , I was reminded of working together . 
Bye , Su-min . 
I loved you . 
I die today . 
You seem different now that you 're married . 
Women act like they won 't change , but they change after marriage . 
Ji-won , who 's not married , gets prettier . 
Jeong Su-min . You should be alert . 
Min-hwan and Ji-won ... They dated for seven years since they 're a good fit . 
Besides , they see each other often at work . 
Old feelings could come back , and ... 
Do you remember the all-you-can-eat restaurant near my old place ? 
We went there often . 
On days we went there , you wouldn 't let me eat breakfast or drink water in case I 'd feel full . 
Why would you remember something so pathetic ? 
Why is that pathetic ? It 's cute . 
Back then , everything felt precious and priceless . 
Money wasn 't that important to me when I was with you . 
You know I really liked you . 
Well , there was no one like you . 
You could put up with me too . 
So You and Yu Ji-hyuk really broke up ? 
I thought so , but ... 
Actually , I almost had a big accident recently . 
Accident ? 
It was with a dump truck , so I would 've died . 
But Mr. Yu came out of nowhere and ... Everything got complicated then . 
Complicated ? 
Yes , horribly complicated . 
Do you know who the driver of that truck was ? 
No , how would I know that ? 
It was Su-min 's dad . 
She knew everything . 
Stop lying . 
You keep lying and lying ! 
I want to . 
I want to stop it too . 
Where are you ? 
Shouldn 't you tell me what 's going on ? 
I 'm going crazy stuck at home . 
Why won 't you come home ? 
Are you with Kang Ji-won ... 
They dated for seven years since they 're a good fit . 
No . 
He wanted to kill her ... 
What 's going on ? Move ! 
Are you really my girlfriend ? 
Avocado ! 
Kang Ji-won . 
I love you . 
You didn 't know she 'd stoop so low , did you ? 
I didn 't either . 
I get she hates me , but how could she try to kill me ? 
She 's crazy . 
I didn 't just see her true colors with this accident . Mr. Yu put someone on me . 
If not , how could he have shown up ? We hadn 't met since we broke up . 
It doesn 't make sense . 
I think I 'm going crazy . 
I feel like I 'm being watched . I 'm so scared . 
What do I do in this situation ? 
So you haven 't come to work because ... 
It was because of me . I couldn 't just leave him . 
Fortunately , he wasn 't hurt that badly . 
So he 's been discharged . 
But when I told him we were through , he told me to resign . 
She 's telling the truth . 
Something felt off , and this was it . 
Yes , Yu Ji-hyuk is rich , so she was right to switch over to him . 
And she was also right to break up with him for 80 billion won . 
She wouldn 't make a good wife for a rich guy . 
If she has 80 billion won , I shouldn 't kill her . 
If she dies , her mom and the others will split the money . Nothing will come to me . 
But if I seduce her again , that 80 billion won will come to me . 
Can you break up with Su-min ? 
What ? 
You know how scary she is now . 
Come back to me . 
I can 't do this alone ... 
Never mind , I should go . 
Ji-won . 
I 'll call you . 
I 'm sorry . I 'm sure you hated to see that . 
What are you doing ? 
Nothing . 
If I don 't do this , I don 't think I can keep sane . 
You like me a lot , don 't you ? 
No , well ... Earlier , Min-hwan seemed to be regretting what he did . 
Min-hwan ? 
He 's probably crunching numbers in his head right now . 
- Hey . - Are you coming today ? 
I was just about to call . 
I think things will get easier . 
I just met with Kang Ji-won . 
She has no idea I was involved . 
So you just have to take care of Ji-won 's mom and Su-min 's dad . 
Then she 'll come to me with 80 billion won . And you can get UK or Yu Ji-hyuk . Do whatever you want . 
We 'll become each other 's support forever . 
Yeah , I see . 
That 's nice and easy . 
He underestimates his ex-girlfriend . 
I told you , didn 't I ? 
Men aren 't wary of the women they 've slept with . 
Where 's Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk ? 
When you were younger , you looked just like that actor . 
I looked better . 
You were handsome . 
What shall we do in China ? 
Let 's kill them . 
Pardon ? 
Is it because of what Min-hwan said ? 
No , nothing bad can come from it . 
If Ji-won wants to return to Min-hwan , she shouldn 't find out that he tried to kill her . 
And even if she 's up to something , she can 't prove anything with those two gone . 
Also , it 's easier than stowing them away . 
Let 's get a divorce . 
We don 't have kids . 
Honestly , I have no reason to live with you . 
Nothing good came from being with you . 
You still can 't reach your dad ? 
Did you meet Kang Ji-won ? 
Yeah , I saw her at work . 
Why do you ask ? 
I thought about it . 
If you and Ji-won get back together then only I 'll get screwed over . 
What 's going on ? 
Did you get a call ? 
He wouldn 't do something like this . 
He could 've told us . 
Are we fired ? 
What 's going on ? 
He closed Werther ? 
Suddenly ? - This is insane . - What the hell ? 
Everyone , I had to close Werther . Your severance pay has been wired . - Closed ? - I 'm sorry . 
What did you get ? 
He 'll pay a month 's salary ... 
We 're unemployed . 
What 's going on ? 
How did this happen ? 
Someone 's coming . 
Why were they in there ? 
Chef ? Come on in . 
Double the pay . 
Your boss here suddenly decided to sell me the restaurant at double the market price . 
It was a good choice . It 's a choice you can make too . 
If you help me , this expensive restaurant will become yours . 
What do I have to do ? 
You have two choices . 
One , take the restaurant . Two , lose your job . 
Chef ! 
My heart fluttered when you contacted me ! 
When Ji-won turned me down , it was nice to get comforted by you . 
Is something wrong ? 
I 'm unemployed now . 
Why ? 
Just because . 
Come on ! 
Still , you 're famous and handsome ... Most importantly , your food tastes so good ! 
So You may be unemployed for a second , - but you ... 
- This industry 's small . 
The restaurant suddenly closed . So all the gossipers will talk about me . 
I know that . It 's the same with me . 
People don 't believe us without even trying to know the story . 
If only a decent chef appeared ... 
Ms. Kang . 
- Hey ! - Hey . 
Why didn 't I think of you ? 
But I don 't know if I can be of any help . 
What are you talking about ? 
Can we talk privately for a second ? 
- Sure . - Let 's go . 
So it was a woman ? 
Yeah . 
Thanks for telling me . 
And I 'm so sorry . No harm will go to you . 
That 's not why I told you . 
Anyway , I didn 't tell Hui-yeon . 
Oh Yu-ra bought Werther and asked Eun-ho to help her . 
He said no , and she fired him . 
And she didn 't tell him what she needed help with . 
I know what it is . Don 't worry . 
I 'll call you back later . I 'm with someone right now . 
You have two choices . 
One , help me . Two , go down with Oh Yu-ra . 
I 'm sure you know which to choose if you 're not a fool . 
What do I have to do ? 
This is Kang Ji-won , Marketing Team 1 . 
Hello , this is Park Min-hwan from UK Marketing Team 3 . 
I was wondering if you could meet me tonight . 
For the mistakes I 've made , I want to treat you . 
I 'd be grateful . 
I 'm always ready . 
I hope it marks a new beginning . You can look forward to it . 
Okay . 
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK - Just a moment . - Sure . 
Yes ? 
Park Min-hwan already has a woman . 
What ? 
You said you couldn 't get them ! 
You seemed down , so I asked around . 
So I sent limited-edition red high heels . Along with the candy tin you spoke of . 
What 's this ? 
Someone brought it today . Shall I get rid of it ? 
No , just leave it . It reminds me of the old days . 
Then I don 't need to play with Min-hwan anymore . 
Thanks for waiting . 
But I don 't think I can do dinner . 
If it 's because of work , it can be helped . 
I 'm free tomorrow too . 
I 'm even free on the weekends . 
I 'm meeting with you after all . 
I 'm free whenever . No . 
What I mean is ... I 'll never do business with you . 
What ? 
The only thing you know how to do is sugarcoat things . 
You ruin everything you touch , and aim for insurance fraud . 
You 're too incompetent to work with . 
What really surprised me is your HR method . 
You especially excel at recruiting female talent . 
I was surprised , since you just got married . 
You 're amazing in many ways . 
Good luck in the future . 
What client is such a scumbag ? 
What are you waiting for ? 
Shall I light the fire ? 
It 's my first time seeing someone die . 
But it 's boring . 
Still , I feel better . 
I don 't think I fit in Korea . 
Nothing goes right here . 
Right . About that restaurant , what do I do with that ? 
Shall I tear it down ? 
Okay , fine . Let 's divorce . 
Hello , this is Oh Yu-ra . 
Hello , my name 's Jeong Su-min . 
There . 
It fits perfectly . 
Why is everything working out so well ? 
I 'll be there in five minutes . Finish up and come down . 
Yes , this is Kang Ji-won of Marketing Team 1 . 
Hello ? 
Who are you ? 
Who are you ? 
Why would you suddenly call here ? 
I 'm sorry . You didn 't pick up your phone . 
It 's in my purse . I didn 't know . Sorry . 
I 'll get there in about 15 minutes . 
Okay . 
Kang Ji-won . 
Ji-won . 
Are you scared ? 
We need to talk . 
Come out . 
Let 's talk . 
We have a lot to talk about . 
You should 've known your place . 
This is the problem with women . 
Was it fun messing with me ? 
Hey , Ji-hyuk 's calling . 
Will you not pick up ? 
Then I 'll pick it up . 
Damn it ... 
You 've got a strong stomach . 
I like money . But aren 't those rich people disgusting ? 
They disgust me . 
What are you doing ? 
How dare you mess with me ? 
Let go of me ! Let go ! 
What ? 
Are you scared ? 
Why did you make a mockery of me ? 
Ji-won . I really wanted to go back to you . I wanted to try hard this time ! 
You tried to kill me . 
You tricked me . 
You treated me like crap ! 
You can kill others , but your life 's that precious ? 
I thought about how to pay you back . 
I could just give Su-min to you , but how do I send you to hell ? 
What ? 
Hell ? 
Do you want to die ? 
This was it . 
Kill me . 
But kill me for sure this time . 
Or I 'll kill you . 
Die . 
You want me to kill you , so I will . 
Are you laughing ? 
Just die . 
Kill me . 
Ji-won , are you okay ? 
Ji-won , wake up . 
Ji-won . 
Ji-won , wake up . 
Ji-won ! 
You disgusting bastard . 
Was I destined to die in Park Min-hwan 's hands ?
