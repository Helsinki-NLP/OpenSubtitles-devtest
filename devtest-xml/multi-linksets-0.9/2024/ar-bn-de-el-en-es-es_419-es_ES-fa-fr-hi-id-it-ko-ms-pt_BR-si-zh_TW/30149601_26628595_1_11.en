After my dad died , it feels like I 'm on a boat every day . 
I want to be happy . 
I want stability . 
I want to step on solid land . 
I 'm not the right person for you . 
Because I want you to be happy . 
You 'll regret this . 
I won 't regret it . 
My goodness . Yang Ju-ran . 
Are you just getting to work ? 
That 's just sucky . 
Ju-ran , you can 't be like this . 
You 're management now . 
You must get here early . 
Your computer should be on before anyone else . 
Also , I didn 't want to say this , but I saw your Jomart email . " If you need anything , let me know " ? 
I mean , will you do everything people ask ? Is that it ? 
God , this is the problem with women . 
If you act that way , it makes our entire team look bad . 
This is unbelievable . 
Mr. Kim isn 't even the manager anymore . 
When he was the manager , I never saw him come early and turn on his computer . 
I think you need to address his attitude once . 
It 's been officially announced . 
But in his position ... 
What position ? 
He 's not the manager anymore . 
I think you should make it clear that you 're his boss . 
You may be okay , but it 'll be hard for new recruits to adapt to our team . 
Excuse me . 
I hate Kim Gyeong-uk so much . 
- Yeah . - He 's the worst . 
How could he act like that ? 
Does he have no shame ? 
No sane person could act that way . 
Don 't be ridiculous . 
I 've been promoted to manager . 
How can I leave at 5 ? 
Work ends at 6 ... 
You may not know this , but I had a temper as a kid . And my grandfather always stressed the importance of patience . 
I 've lived by that ... 
When did I look down on you ? 
Do I look like a bum ? 
Is this good ? 
Yeah , it tastes like coffee . 
- Yeah . - Give me one too . 
I need to wake up . 
I think I have to leave early and come back later . 
Can 't your parents help ? 
It must be tough for you . 
My husband 's at home . How can I ask my parents for help ? 
But you practically do everything . 
- Worrying about your ... - My husband is ... 
I feel so exposed . 
You 're just like me . 
I also worried about my husband ... 
No , I mean , my boyfriend . 
In the end , I was the one who was ruined . 
Hey . 
I learned a lot . Consideration has limits too . 
Bad people won 't appreciate your consideration for them . 
Is Mr. Yu not coming to work today ? 
No . Do you have something to report ? 
He took a day off today . He 's sick . 
I think he 's caught a cold . 
It 's been cold lately . This is a first for him . 
Open up . 
Hey , I said I didn 't need it . 
You 're so stubborn . Did you have to make that ? 
You didn 't do that for me . 
It 's for your own satisfaction . I told you , I hate porridge . 
Still , take one more bite . 
I said , I won 't . God damn it . 
This is so like me . 
Is he not home ? 
It 's 20130419 . 
My passcode . 
Pang ? 
Mr. Yu ! 
Mr. Yu ! 
Mr. Yu ! 
Get up . Let 's go to the hospital . 
It 's Kang Ji-won . 
I can 't keep seeing you like this . 
Are you okay ? 
A doctor came by . 
I took my medicine . 
Are you still ... anxious ? 
Does it feel rocky ? 
I hope you don 't feel like you 're on a boat . 
... it feels like I 'm on a boat every day . 
My feet are firmly planted , but the boat keeps rocking . 
I feel anxious . 
I can 't be your land . 
I want stability . 
I want to step on solid land . 
I want to be solid land . 
I hope you 're stable and happy . 
Because you 're a good person . 
Were you that man ? 
I 'm so hurt . 
I knew it was you the moment I saw you again . 
You 've always been in my heart . 
Hello ! 
You 're so much like your brother . 
What ? I am ? 
That 's such an insult . 
You 're mean . 
I came here to talk strategy . 
I just happen to have two musical tickets . You two should go together ... 
Well , I ... 
Ji-won ... 
I thought I was okay . 
I 'm not the wrong sentence ... in her novel . 
What ? The wrong sentence ? What does that mean ? 
Hey . Are you okay ? 
Your fever 's down . That 's good . 
I have to go to work ! 
Did something happen last night ? 
Wait . You won 't say last night was a mistake , will you ? 
No , that never happened . I took medicine , so I was out of it . 
And I thought seeing you was a dream . 
You remember then . 
What did I say last night ? 
You have a surprising side . 
You spoke casually to me . 
I 'm sorry . 
You said you hoped I was stable and happy . 
And that you recognized me the moment we met again . 
Also ... that you continued to like me . 
And that you wanted to be land for me . 
Ji-won , I ... 
I 'm sorry I didn 't recognize you . 
We might regret it . 
But let 's regret it together if we do . 
Then we 'll be okay . 
To tell the truth , when you told me how you felt , I thought it was the reason I came back . 
To be able to trust someone again , like someone , and be happy . 
I can do that , right ? 
What are you doing next weekend ? 
Us ? 
Whatever you want to do . 
" Us " ? 
Let 's talk . 
Do it here . 
We have to work together . 
But treating me like I 'm invisible makes everyone uncomfortable . 
You mean you are . 
Then you shouldn 't have done something to cause that . 
Damn it ! 
Let go ! Let go of me ! 
I asked to break up because our relationship isn 't the same as it used to be . 
I want a relationship that everyone 's envious of . 
Damn it . 
Where did things go wrong ? 
Are the only women you know on your team ? 
You messed up with that terrible woman , and this one doesn 't seem that better . 
I 'll be honest . 
I didn 't think my son would get married this way . 
Still , since you graduated from Hankuk University . 
She was a business major . She 's smart and good at her job . 
And she 'll work after she gives birth . Great , right ? 
I liked studying , Mother . 
Sons take after their moms . 
Don 't be too upset . 
My mom didn 't think I 'd get married like this either . But I convinced her . 
Also , she adores Min-hwan . 
Yeah , that 's true . 
So your dad ran a business in Busan ? 
And your mom 's a teacher ? 
Yes . 
Before my dad passed away , our family was very happy . 
I just want to live like my parents did . 
They loved each other so much and were very devoted parents . 
From what I saw in the cooking class , I can tell you 're smart . 
I lack a lot . I hope you can teach me . 
Originally , a woman needs to meet the right man . 
Judging by your taste in men , you 're very smart . 
- Eat up . - Okay . You 're right . Sons take after their moms . 
That 's why Min-hwan takes after me and is very smart . 
You 're right , Mother . 
- Bye , Mom . - Okay , I 'm off . 
Get home safe , Mother . 
Okay , you too . 
Hankuk University ? 
Why did you lie about that ? 
I did it for you . 
Ji-won graduated from there . 
So how could I tell her that you went to a no name college ? 
You wanted a fresh start . Why lie - - 
Lie ? 
Does your mom adore me ? 
How can she when I 've never met her ? 
Let 's not get sensitive over this . 
Everything will work out . 
I think my mom approves . 
I 'll tell you the date of the family meeting . 
- See you then . Bye . - What ? 
They booked a wedding hall ? 
It looks like they won 't tell the company , 
- but it 's called Crown ... - Crown Wedding Hall . 
That 's it . 
That 's where I married him . 
It 's the worst place imaginable to women . 
It must be over now . 
This is huge news . 
My parents told my husband to work at their restaurant . 
We didn 't say anything when you quit your job because we thought it didn 't matter which one worked outside these days . 
But ! My daughter goes to work , takes care of Yeon-ji , and does the housework . 
Ju-ran does everything . 
I should go to work . 
The head of the family raising a child and doing housework is just ... 
That 's why I 'm telling you to work at our galbi restaurant . 
It 's big , so there 's so much to do . 
Wash the grills and dishes , get the meat , serve customers , clean . 
Sir , just hear me out . 
I 'm not the type to do that kind of work . 
What ... 
How could you say that ? 
You 're not the type ? 
- Then what type of work is for you ? 
- Housework and parenting ? 
It 's decided then . 
Wake up early , take Ju-ran to work , and bring Yeon-ji to the restaurant . 
You 're amazing . 
Ms. Yang usually just puts up with things . And you helped her take a step further . 
Isn 't this great ? 
So refreshing , right ? 
I 'd always come here when I had a hard time in college . To regain the strength to keep going . 
It 's my first time coming here happy . 
Wow ... I never though I 'd have this again . 
Is it a hot spot ? 
To me , it is . 
It disappears in a few years because of redevelopment . 
Do you remember ? We went to eat gukbap . 
Wasn 't I brave then ? 
I was so surprised . To see such a luxurious gukbap restaurant . 
You were quite classy . You gave off a young and rich vibe . 
No way . 
There . The way you put the rice into the soup . 
Anyone could tell . 
Add the jeongguji . 
That 's right . I should . 
No . 
I was kidding . 
This one . Chives . This isn 't a side dish . You put it in your soup . 
But people from Seoul eat it separately . That 's just wrong . 
All right . 
Eat it with the meat . 
Okay . 
How is it ? Better , right ? 
It 's nice and spicy . 
Eat up . 
Mr. Yu , when you date , do you say , " Today marks day one . " 
Or things like that ? 
When will you stop calling me Mr. Yu ? 
Well ... Until you get promoted to director ? 
I 'm just kidding . 
What did your ex-girlfriends call you ? 
I didn 't have to do any of that . 
I don 't remember what they called me . 
It didn 't matter . 
The only name I know is this . " Kang Ji-won . " 
" Ji-won . " 
Only Kang Ji-won . 
What 's wrong with him ? Look at him . What 's with him ? 
I don 't know . 
Isn 't he tired of it ? 
He hasn 't changed a bit . 
I 'm here . 
Hello , sir . 
I 'm Kim Tae-hyeong , and I have been assigned to Marketing Team 1 . Nice to meet you . 
Yeah . 
I 'm originally a manager . 
Hey , you 're here . 
Gosh , this chair recognizes its owner . It fits my butt perfectly . 
Ms. Yang . 
No ... Manager Yang , you 'll return it to me soon , so use it carefully , okay ? 
- Hey . Work hard . - Yes . 
Yes , sir . 
Assistant Manager Kim . 
Where 's your proposal ? 
I said I 'd do it ... 
What did you just say ? 
Your idea isn 't that good , so you should at least be diligent . 
Oh , don 't worry . 
It doesn 't suck . It 's just not that good . 
Are you insane ? 
What the hell are you doing ? 
You know hierarchy better than anyone does . 
You know how it works . You 're not the manager anymore . 
But isn 't sitting here uncomfortable ? 
I need to know your standards in order to meet them . 
Why are you speaking to me like that ? Where are your formalities ? 
That 's how you spoke to me . I figured it was okay . 
I 'm your boss now . But I 'm respectful while you 're not . 
It 's strange . 
So what shall we do ? Shall we both be more respectful ? Or ... shall I speak casually to you ? 
Mr. Kim . 
Surely , only men look after men . 
These little chicks ... 
How dare these chicks try to break up a male friendship ? 
- So cheeky . - Right ? 
Mr. Park . Let 's drink and go to a sauna tonight . 
Ms. Yang 's dad is buying galbi tonight ... 
But I can 't go there . 
I have plans at home . Sorry . 
Really ? Okay . 
By the way , you 're not really in a relationship with Su-min , are you ? 
No , sir . 
Good . 
What a great day . 
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION ! 
Ms. Yang , congratulations ! 
Eat as much as you want and drink ! 
Yang Ju-ran bombs ! 
Is that not it ? 
This is pretty famous . 
Amazing . 
Wow , you 're the best . 
- Great job . - Congrats . 
Thanks . 
Thanks , everyone . 
Shall we toast ? 
Cheers . 
- Cheers ! - Cheers ! My , my ! We have prepared the best beef for the best marketing team ! 
It 's the full course with all the special cuts ! 
I hope you take your time to enjoy it ! 
- Yang Ju-ran ! - Yang Ju-ran ! 
Okay , everyone . 
Please take care of my princess . 
Princess ! Hip , hip , hooray ! 
- Princess ! - Princess ! 
- Yang Ju-ran ! 
- Dad ! 
Don 't call me Princess . 
Daughter , don 't say that . 
Honey . 
- Princess . - Stop it . 
I swear ... I 'll do everything for my princess . 
I think this is what I really wanted , Dad . 
Not being alone . 
Standing on firm land and not letting any wave shake me . 
It was so easy . 
All I needed was one person on my side . 
I think I really have one now . 
Go inside first . 
- What ? - Your lips . 
All right . 
Go now . Bye . 
Honey . Where were you ? 
You could 've said hi ... 
Sir . 
Come on in . 
Hurry up . 
Hello . 
I 'm Lee Jae-won , Ju-ran 's husband . 
Well ... Please take good care of my wife . 
Yeah . 
Thank you . 
- Ms . Yang . - Yeah ? 
How is Mr. Lee here ? 
I invited him . 
I got promoted because he believed in me . 
Excuse me . 
Mr. Lee . 
- May I ? 
- He came because she asked ? 
Seriously ? 
Damn it ... 
This sucks . - I can 't do it . - I can 't do it . 
- What the hell ? - What ? 
You scared me . 
Unbelievable . 
What 's wrong with him ? 
I won 't tell my coworkers . Got it ? 
What are you saying ? 
- Hello . - Hello . 
This house is decent , right ? 
There aren 't many houses for rent when it 's urgent . 
I happen to have one . 
Wait . Rent ? 
You said you 'd buy me a house . 
After you live together for two years . - What ? 
- The couple is so blessed . 
- Let 's go inside . - Okay . 
Why is it suddenly rent ? 
Southeast Asia is nice too . I recommend Hawaii . 
She 's pregnant . It 's not safe to fly . There are lots to see in Korea . 
Bulguksa ? 
What are you doing ? 
Hello . 
Get me a drink . 
This color is nice . 
Let 's do the makeup like this . 
- Okay . - For the dress ... Let 's see . 
This is too exposed . 
No . This is nice . It 's decent . 
We 'll pick this for the dress . 
What is this ? 
Who picks these types of invitations ? 
What 's with your mom ? 
Then tell her that ! 
You can 't say it to her . Why take it out on me ? 
How can I say that to her ? 
You have to do it ! 
Seriously ? 
We 're getting married . 
Can you believe this ? 
They 're really doing it ? 
- Wow ... - I can 't believe it . 
I think you should check your email . 
My email ? 
Sir , what 's with the email ? 
Who said to ... send out a company announcement ? 
Name and department , please . 
A wedding announcement for Park Min-hwan , Marketing Team 3 . 
Aren 't you getting married ? 
Well ... I am , but ... 
When an employee gets married , announcements and monetary gifts are given . 
And the team will be given days off to attend the wedding . 
And you need days off to go on your honeymoon . 
That 's all right , but ... It 's my wedding , and I didn 't say anything ! 
Did I ask you to announce it ? 
This is insane . 
It seems he 's in a difficult position because he 's marrying Ms. Kang Ji-won 's friend . 
I mean , it 's frowned upon . 
I get that you like Kang Ji-won . But ... you don 't seem like the type to meddle with Min-hwan and Su-min . 
Scumbags like them have nothing to do with you . 
If it concerns Ji-won , it concerns me . 
He 's laughing . 
I 've never seen him like that before . It was touching . 
You ? 
That 's not like you . 
I saw him in a new light . 
I understand your intent , but Ji-hyuk was no fun at all . 
He didn 't want anything . 
He suppressed his emotions . 
He had everything , so he didn 't really need me . 
But this time ... he seems like he 's really living . For the first time . 
Ji-hyuk , you sent it ? 
I couldn 't stand it . 
I admit that it was childish . 
This is amazing . 
What is ? 
That someone 's on my side . 
Someone to get mad about things for me . 
What are you thinking ? 
I 'm thinking about kissing you . 
What ? 
Actually , more than that ... 
- Damn it ! - My goodness ! 
What are you doing ? 
She 's pregnant ! 
Mom , please ! You don 't know anything . 
What is this ? 
Did you send the invitation to work ? 
Work ? 
What ? 
This is ... 
It was announced at work ! 
What ? 
Everyone knows we 're getting married now . 
How can I go to work ? 
How can I work there now ? 
God damn it ! 
- You 're so loud ! - Why can 't you ? 
What 's the problem ? Is marrying me that bad ? 
Exactly ! 
Things like this happen ! I thought there was big trouble . 
Hey ! I need to collect at your wedding ! 
Yeah , you 're not alone now . Think about our baby general . 
Our baby , my foot ! Why 's he holding me back ? 
Damn it ! 
You brat ! That 's my grandson ! 
Stop hitting me ! 
Seriously ? 
What about me ? 
This is hardest on me ! 
Damn it ! 
Go inside . This won 't do . 
What 's wrong with him ? 
He 's so loud . 
Be careful , sweetie . 
It must be too loud for our baby general . 
Listen . All men are children . 
He 'll go back to being normal when he calms down . 
So don 't worry about a thing . 
Just think about having a healthy baby . 
I know he 's hot-tempered . 
Why don 't you stay the night here ? 
No , I should go home . 
This is supposed to be good for the baby . 
It 's great for brain development . Listen to it before you go . 
I 'm off . 
I want to live . 
Hey . 
Are you ready ? 
Yeah , almost . Just a second . 
Ji-won , wait . 
Can you sit for a second ? 
What 's this ? 
Kang Ji-won deserves the best . 
It 's okay . You 're pretty . 
I 'm getting a family . 
I won . 
Hey ! 
Mother . 
Is my stomach poking out ? 
It 'd better not . That 's why we 're having this shotgun wedding . 
By the way , where are your friends ? 
Are you sure you told them the right time ? 
Well ... Yes . 
Oh , your mother 's here . Shall we take a picture ? 
No , this is my mother-in-law . 
I look good in pink . 
Isn 't this color so beautiful ? 
Yes , you look beautiful . 
Thanks . 
- Let 's sit down . - Okay . 
The wedding dress is a little ... 
Just take the picture . 
Her bump isn 't showing yet , but it 's best we leave no records . 
Just take it . 
Now . 
Yes , I understand . 
Smile . 
- Hey ... - Yes ? 
Where 's your mother ? 
Hello ! 
I 'm sorry I 'm so late . 
Hello . 
There must 've been a lot of traffic . 
Yes , there was . 
I only lived in Busan . 
Seoul 's traffic surprised me . 
Su-min , you look so pretty . 
I 'm sorry I 'm late . 
Why are you so late , ma 'am ? 
I told you to come early . 
Sorry . 
There was so much traffic . 
There was an accident near here . 
Whatever . 
Do you remember everything ? My dad passed away . You 're a teacher . 
Of course . 
He ran a business , left a lot of wealth , and I 'm set for my later life . 
What about friends ? 
For 11 people , 300,000 won each , right ? 
Hello ! Thank you . 
Hello . 
- It 's been so long . - Congratulations . 
- Hey . - Hey . 
You 're going after all . You said she wasn 't the wife type . 
Thank you . 
Stop that ! 
Did you come alone ? 
Where are the others ? 
You know Yun-gyeong 's temper . 
She won 't come to a cheater 's wedding . The other girls wouldn 't come either . 
Jong-chan 's on a business trip . Yong-gu will be at the reception . 
Reception ? That useless bastard . 
Wow . Who are they ? 
Friends of the bride ? 
Congratulations . 
I think you should keep this to yourself . 
You came . 
You look pretty . 
But this ... You didn 't have to . 
You 'll eat before you go , right ? 
Wait , that 's ... 
Let 's go . 
I thought I 'd seen her before . 
Is that your ex-girlfriend ? Kang Ji-won ? 
What ? She 's a goddess . 
You got dumped , didn 't you ? I thought you dumped her . 
Damn you ! Stop talking ! 
You 're so annoying . 
What 's this ? 
Are you sued ? Did you borrow money ? 
You 'll be entering soon . 
Okay . 
That 's okay . 
Why are you so late ? 
I thought you weren 't coming . 
You caught my bouquet . 
Come on . You want the bouquet ? That 's not right . 
Min-hwan 's parents know your face . 
That 's true . 
The dress looks good on you . 
Right ? My mother-in-law picked it for me . 
It 's a little disappointing , but the elders like it , so what can I do ? 
She thinks of me as her daughter . 
I 'm glad you two get along . 
Let 's take a picture . Call the photographer . 
No . 
I don 't think that 's necessary . 
Congratulations ... on picking up my trash . 
Park Min-hwan bought me this . 
So use it or sell it , do whatever you want with it . 
Trash ? 
She threw Min-hwan away ? 
Damn it . Wow , items are free . 
How can I work there now ? 
No , that 's not possible . 
I 'm marrying Min-hwan . 
I 'll start a new family . 
I can 't be tied to you forever . 
You 're entering soon . 
Now , it 's time to meet the beautiful bride . - Let 's greet her with a round of applause . 
No , I stole them . The man and family that used to be Ji-won 's . They 're all mine now . 
I won . 
I 'm starting over now . 
The groom , Park Min-hwan , and the bride , Jeong Su-min , will be wed in the presence of their family and friends today ... 
Let 's smile a little , ma 'am . 
Okay , good . 
Jeong Su-min doesn 't look like her mom at all , right ? 
She must look like her dad . 
You 're right . 
I 'll take two more . 
Let 's all smile . Sir , smile . 
I guess you haven 't seen her . 
People hire guests these days . Do you think she hired her ? 
Come on . 
But if my memory 's correct , Jeong Su-min 's mom is still alive . 
Eun-ho , what are you doing here ? 
Su-min sent me the wedding invitation . 
But the problem is ... 
Could the friends of the bride and groom come out now ? 
I showed it to Ye-ji , and they came looking like that . 
Wait ! 
- The bride 's old friends are here ! - Here ! 
They 're sorry , so they 'll take revenge for you . 
Are they your friends ? 
No ... 
Su-min , I 'm here . 
Who 's getting the bouquet ? Shall I ? 
Ji-won may be your other half , but you 're marrying her man after all . 
How could she catch the bouquet for you ? 
Is that true ? 
She stole her friend 's man ? 
Who else did you send the invitation to ? 
Take care of this . 
What do you think you 're doing ? 
Who are you people ? 
- I should say hi to her . - No ... 
I 'm Su-min 's best friend . The left ball ! 
Let go of me . What ... Where are your manners ? 
I 'm her other best friend . The right ball . 
Where did these vulgar people come from ? 
Vulgar ? 
What are you thinking ? 
We 're like her eyeballs . And we 're the apple of each other 's eyes . 
Come on ! 
Were you thinking about something vulgar ? 
I 'm the nose ! 
They 're the right and left balls , and I 'm the nose . 
Do you know whose family wedding this is ? 
The family who raised a dog that cheated on his girlfriend with her bestie . 
But if there 's more to know , enlighten me . 
What did you just say ? 
Stop ! Mother ! 
How dare you ! 
- Mother ! - Kick them out ! 
Where 's Min-hwan ? 
Calm down , everyone . 
Nothing 's wrong . 
Let 's finish the wedding . Where 's the groom ? 
Min-hwan ! 
You 've got great friends . 
They were amazing too when they bullied me . 
If you 're tired , shall we go ? 
Shall we ? 
You two can talk later . 
Yeah , you two . I 'll call you later . 
Yeah , okay . 
Aren 't you going to eat ? 
I paid 1,000 won for a meal ticket . 
Let 's go . 
He must 've made up his mind . 
Are you okay ? 
I 'm going to eat . Do you want to join me ? 
If you 're okay with somewhere else , I 'll buy . 
Of course ! Sounds great . 
But my manager was supposed to come too . 
Where is she ? 
I told you not to come back here . 
It 's the weekend . Why are you here ? 
I can 't go home right now . 
Yeon-ji 's at home . And I haven 't gotten myself sorted yet . 
I 've been so busy . So I didn 't get a chance to hear the checkup results . 
And I heard it over the phone . 
Calm down and speak clearly . 
No ... Let 's just leave here . 
I have stomach cancer . 
Great job . Go and rest . 
You too . 
I came to talk for a moment . 
But this is awkward . 
Hello . 
I 'm Yu Ji-hyuk 's fiancée . 
Wait ... Ex-fiancée , I guess ? Since he called off the engagement . 
I didn 't know it was because he had a woman .
