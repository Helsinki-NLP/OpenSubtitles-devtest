Kill me . 
Was I destined to die in Park Min-hwan 's hands ? 
Ji-won . Ji-won . 
Wait . Hold on ... 
Tell me again . 
I won 't answer Lee Jae-won 's calls . 
If he comes to the house , I won 't open the door , and call you right away . 
Mr. Lee . Thank you for driving me to the hospital every time like this and giving me divorce advice , but - - 
You don 't have to thank me for that . 
It 's work for me . 
I get paid a lot of money from UK . 
I do what my employer wants . 
Okay . 
But you said you cared about me . 
You just have to say your piece . 
Just a moment . 
Hey , what is it at this hour ? 
I 'm at the police station . 
The police station ? 
I 'll be right there . 
No , go to the hospital instead . YUIL MEDICAL CENTER EPISODE 15 
Kang Ji-won , 32 , transferred from UK in Gangnam . Where is she ? 
Ji-won . 
Her breathing and pulse are stable now . But she has a fever , so we 'll check her once she wakes up . 
It was an assault , so she came with the police . I 'll get you her record . 
Hey . I 'm going to ruin your life , so brace yourself . 
I 'll tell the media a third-generation tycoon assaulted me . 
You can 't cover things up these days . 
I have nothing to lose now . Thanks to you . 
But isn 't Ji-won too inferior to ruin your life over ? 
She 's nothing but skin and bones . 
Mr. Yu . Do you want some advice ? 
Don 't trust her . 
Do you know why I went mad ? Ji-won makes people lose their minds . 
Ji-won and I aren 't the ones that ruined you . It 's your trashy personality . 
Look how you beat me . Is your personality any better ? 
You can 't do this because you fight better . 
That 's a bit rich , considering what you did to a woman half your size . 
What ? 
You seek equality when at a disadvantage , and strength when at an advantage . 
I hate using my strength . But not to you . 
Mr. Yu , you can come out . 
Let 's go . 
What about me ? 
Why can 't I come out ? 
What about me ? 
Do you really think you can 't go any lower ? 
You 're wrong . 
No , wait . Is it because he 's rich ? 
I work at UK too ! 
What about me ? 
One law for the rich and another for the poor ! 
Min-hwan is fired as of today for assaulting a colleague and violating the rules . 
Find anything else . 
I checked during his affair incident . 
AWOL and unclear corporate card statements . And he illegally treated clients . 
Good . Doesn 't he have a company loan ? 
I 'll ask the bank for a repayment request . 
I 'll add assault , injury , and anything else . 
And Ms. Kang is ... She 's at home . 
It 's what she wanted . 
I happened to be with Ms. Yang . 
So I left Ms. Kang with her , but she didn 't look good . 
You said there was a debt that Min-hwan hadn 't paid off , right ? 
Put some pressure on that . 
Or buy the bonds . 
I 'll look into it . 
Mr. Yu . 
How 's Ji-won ? 
She 's not good . 
I think she 'll be better if she sleeps , so I 'll get her some milk . 
There 's nothing in her house . 
Are you okay ? 
Well , yes . 
Thank you . I 'll take it from here . You should go home and rest . 
Ji-hyuk . 
I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for everything . 
Were you hurt ? 
What 's this ? 
Hello . 
Is that all ? 
It can 't be . 
Considering you called because your husband 's in my care , there should be more . 
How about going to China for a while ? 
Oh , my . We would be so thankful if you could do that for us . 
It 'll be a rough ride on the ship though . 
That 's nothing at all . We couldn 't even get the job done . 
If you give us another chance , I 'll hit the accelerator and crush her . 
So just let me know . 
Yeah , thank you . 
Poor people always try to keep a record . 
As insurance . 
What do you want ? 
Do you hate that I 'm taking care of your father ? 
Now that crushing Kang Ji-won isn 't so simple anymore , you suddenly say , " Don 't do anything . " 
Then Park Min-hwan suddenly asks me for a divorce , and my dad won 't pick up , so I realize , " I 'll get screwed over . " 
Judging by the look on your face , you 're nothing special . 
Darn it . Why have I been cooped up at home like that ? 
I ask the questions now . 
What can you do for me ? 
Are the shrimps in Korea poisonous ? 
Why don 't they know their place ? 
Have the bodies of Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk been found ? 
I 'll check the police report . 
Make sure there 's no news about it . 
Jeong Su-min shouldn 't feel threatened now . 
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min . Can we take care of them both at once ? 
Hello ? 
I 'm at the police station right now . 
I 'm sorry , but can I ask for a favor ? 
What ? The police station ? 
SUNGSAM POLICE STATION We got you out , but it 's pretty serious . We may not be able to cover it . What ? What are you saying ? 
It wasn 't what we agreed on . 
If we have to fight UK head-on , the burden on Ms. Oh will be big . 
Hey ! 
What 's with the attitude ? 
Who do you think you are ? 
You 're not the VP of Cloud Air ! 
Hey . You 're not either . 
So don 't be rude . 
Damn it . 
You only know how to fight in the ring . Watch your mouth . 
You 're just Yu-ra 's henchman . Don 't act like you 're my boss . 
Bastard . 
Mister , wait ! 
Why would you give him a nosebleed ? 
Is there a reason I can 't ? 
He gave me attitude ! 
Damn it ... 
He 's just worried about me . Since your wife came and threatened me today . 
It was scary . 
What ? 
About what ? 
She said you asked for a divorce . She won 't go down alone . 
She won 't let you get away alone . 
Is she out of her mind ? Damn it . 
Hold on . 
Work 's calling me . Hang up . I 'll call you back later . 
Hello ? 
Mr. Park , I called to say you 're fired as of today . 
You didn 't come to work today , so the legal team has sent someone to deliver your written dismissal . 
Where are you ? 
Someone from your workplace is here . You 're fired ? 
What on earth have you been doing ? 
I am calling to inform your obligation to repay the UK guaranteed loan is effective as of today . 
Damn it ! 
Why does he keep calling ? 
- Sir . - What ? 
Why won 't you pick up ? 
When the trust is gone , we get a physical rights waiver signed , you see . 
For those who don 't pay back money , which hole should we poke to get it back ? 
Hole ? What hole ? 
Those damn thugs . 
Please . 
Su-min . 
Crap . 
I did stocks . 
I earned quite a lot . 
Please , Su-min ! 
Have some money . Please ! 
I need her certificate ... 
Please , be there . 
It 's there ! 
Her certificate 's here ! 
What 's her password ? 
Su-min , please have some money . 
Please ! 
She has 80 million won ? 
Why does she have so much ? 
She stole the money for her dad ? 
She 's really something . 
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK Mr. Yu ? 
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER 
Sue me for adultery ? You ? 
- Call security . - How could you ? 
Sir , you can 't do this here . 
- Doctor . - Are you drunk ? 
I 'm her husband . 
But she was hiding here and ignoring my calls . 
And she sued me for adultery . 
Without evidence . 
I have it . 
Do you really want to do this here ? 
At the hospital ? 
What do you have ? 
The dashcam recording ? 
There 's no video . 
Ju-ran . 
Ju-ran ! 
You can 't divorce me with that ! 
You must have the video . Hard evidence . 
- Let 's get you outside . - Come on . 
Yeon-ji will be fatherless because of you . 
Who are you ? What 's going on ? Let go ! 
Did you even read the divorce papers ? 
Lee Seok-jun . I 'm Ms. Yang Ju-ran 's lawyer . 
I 'll apply for a restraining order . 
Never come back . 
Are you okay ? 
Yes . 
The doctor is good and confident about the surgery , 
- so don 't worry . - Right . 
Is Ji-won okay ? 
As far as I know , yes . 
But you should worry about yourself . 
It 's been a while . 
I was so surprised to get your call . 
It 's nice to see you after so long . 
Can I take your order ? 
Have you been well ? 
Yes , I have . 
To be honest , I 'm not doing that well . 
Min-hwan and I are getting a divorce . 
I left the house yesterday . I 'm staying upstairs . 
I 'm going to rest for now . 
It must be karma . 
Blinded by love , I betrayed my only best friend . 
In the end ... Anyway , I 'm all alone now . 
The divorce makes this easier to say . 
Did you try to kill Ji-won ? 
I would 've done the same . 
I 'm saying I know Ji-won and Min-hwan are seeing each other again . 
Are they really ... seeing each other again ? 
Let 's charge them with adultery . 
I 'll let you know when and where to go . 
If you want , I 'll get you the best lawyer too . 
You just fulfill your role as his legal spouse . 
Why ? 
Because it 's not fair . 
Isn 't your life ruined because of Min-hwan ? 
If you divorce , you won 't be rewarded for your work at the company . 
You 'll be left with nothing . 
That 's true ... for me . 
But what do you gain ? 
I want to get Kang Ji-won back . 
I like Ji-won . 
So I hate that she 's with him . 
I 'm going to make her come back to me . 
So help me . 
Can I ask you something ? 
Why do you hate me ? 
Because you 're selfish . 
There are those who gnaw at people around them . 
You are that type , so I hate you . 
You don 't know me that well . 
You don 't trust anyone , do you ? That 's because you 're not trustworthy . 
You think everyone 's like you , so you can 't trust anyone . 
How can you work with me thinking like that ? 
Didn 't you ask me why I hated you ? I never said I couldn 't work with you . 
Let me know when you decide . 
It went well . 
As you said , she asked me why I was helping her . 
I didn 't think she 'd believe me if I lied , so I mixed in some truth . 
Except that it 'll be Oh Yu-ra and Park Min-hwan instead , everything I said was true . 
Also ... There 's an insurance policy provided to company employees . 
A family insurance . It compensates yourself , spouse , and immediate family . 
You can decide to keep it when you quit . 
A notice will go to Park Min-hwan soon . 
I can take care of the more urgent debt if this gets sold . 
He doesn 't know such insurance existed , but he will soon . 
The stage is being set . 
Shall I just die ? 
Though it 's useless if Min-hwan doesn 't decide to die . 
If I die ... my mom and dad can get my life insurance benefit . 
Min-hwan could 've stopped several times on his way here , but he didn 't . 
He 'll go all the way . 
Then there 's no problem . 
Jeong Su-min will go all the way too . 
Why is everyone looking for Kang Ji-won ? 
I think Jeong Su-min is more obsessed with you right now . 
It 's that moment now . 
All that 's left is for her to experience it . 
How about returning to Japan ? 
Yu Ji-hyuk is moving more actively than before . 
He 's pressuring Park Min-hwan with his debt and private loans . He won 't last long . 
And he hasn 't given up on Man-sik and Hui-suk . 
He got all the CCTV footage from the abandoned factory . 
He won 't find anything , but nothing good can come from fighting UK head-on . 
You must not be confident . Seeing how you 're telling me to run away . 
It 's okay . 
His grandfather is different . 
Unlike Ji-hyuk , who 's like a flower in a green house , he 's realistic . 
He knows how much of a nuisance Cinderella can be . 
Checkmate . 
I can never beat you . 
You want everything , so I can read your hand . 
A good leader should know how to give up something that 's not theirs . 
Okay . 
Hey ! 
We were just playing janggi . 
And I lost again . 
But I think I can beat you . Do you want to play ? 
Grandfather . You asked me to bring the woman I like . 
I will introduce her to you . So don 't let Yu-ra into the house anymore . 
You said it was one-sided and weren 't going to make it work . 
Did you change your mind ? 
Yes , I 'm going to pursue it . 
So I can 't have my ex-fiancÃ © e frequenting my house . 
I was so indifferent during our engagement . 
I didn 't know he was so impatient . 
People like us can 't marry for love , can we ? 
Get permission from your grandfather before you - - 
I will . 
I 'll introduce her now . 
Hello , I 'm Kang Ji-won . 
Let 's get rid of Kang Ji-won . 
You 're not going back to Japan ? 
I can 't live with myself if I lose . 
Why do I have to feel this way over those cockroaches ? 
Yeah , I should 've done it myself . 
It 's a headache having others do it . 
I 've decided to face the obstacles that are bound to happen . 
When I met you last time , there 's something I didn 't tell you . 
Powering through isn 't a solution to everything . 
I 'm aware he gave you a lot for seeing him briefly . 
So what are you going to do from now on ? 
I 'll look back and reflect on my faults . 
I 'll correct what I can . 
And the rest ... I guess it is what it is . 
It 's time for you to step back and say , " It is what it is . " 
So you knew . 
I gave him hell for that . 
That won 't ever happen again . 
He lacks so much . 
You spoiled him . 
He only knows how to work . He has no concept of money . 
Honestly , I was flustered because he was like a rich boy . 
What are you trying to say ? 
But I liked that about him . 
To tell you the truth , I lack a lot too . 
When I thought he was a perfect third-generation chaebol , he seemed unreachable . 
But he can be foolish , get angry , and messy . 
He gets embarrassed , and sometimes ... he acts like a baby . Seeing those sides of him , 
I thought we could do well together . 
I want to be happy with him . 
Sir . Please , give Yu Ji-hyuk to me . 
Park Min-hwan 's termination will be finalized by tomorrow . 
By the way , why did you ask about the insurance for employees ? 
They don 't usually keep it . 
It 's just a company perk . Most don 't know about it . 
Park Min-hwan will do it . 
That looks good . 
Three . 
How 's the taste and texture ? 
As you predicted , the spinach pasta with sea snails was most popular . 
It 'll be the main product . 
That 's good . 
Sea snails and spinach aren 't common ingredients for pasta in Korea ... 
Look at the camera . 
Okay . 
Yes , that 's good . 
Just be comfortable . 
He 's going to get a natural look . 
Great job today . 
It was nothing . You saved me from being unemployed . I appreciate it . 
I 'll send you the recipe revisions soon . 
- It 's hard . - Yeah . 
I 'll send you the draft and factory schedule too . 
By the way , I didn 't see Yu Hui-yeon and Yu Ji-hyuk today . 
Mr. Yu was there all day . 
I haven 't seen Hui-yeon either . 
Where did she go ? 
I should get going . 
- Goodbye ! - Bye ! 
Why not pick up my calls ? 
Why won 't you pick up ? 
Why do I have to pick up your calls ? 
Yeah , I get it . 
You were with him for seven years , but he chose me over you . 
I 'm sure it was hard to accept . 
But still , how could you seduce a married man ? 
Is this security ? 
This is the 16th floor . 
An outsider is here . 
Take care of her . 
What are you doing ? 
Do you think I 'd let it slide ? 
Hey . 
Why would I sleep with someone else 's man ? I 'm not you . 
Right , you seduced Min-hwan this way , so I 'm sure you know best . 
But if he betrayed his girlfriend of seven years , why didn 't you know he could do the same to you ? 
I 'll put posters up here to make you two too ashamed to work here . 
I won 't stand for it . 
That 's too bad . 
Your husband was fired . 
So stop suspecting me , and go be a good wife . Oh , wait . 
You two are divorcing . 
That 's too bad . 
But ... thinking about it is pissing me off . 
Only you would covet trash like Min-hwan . 
Why would I ? 
Unless I was a fool . 
Let go . I 'm going . Let me go ! 
Min-hwan , Jeong Su-min just came and caused a fuss . It scared me . 
But rumors won 't spread here since everyone thinks Su-min 's crazy . 
Oh , no . I sent it to the wrong person . Sorry . 
Is she out of her mind ? 
I won 't stand for this . 
Jeong Su-min will call me soon . 
I 'm going to ruin Kang Ji-won . 
Have her . 
In return , she has to hit rock bottom first . 
I 'll make her beg . 
I won 't cooperate before that . 
We have Su-min in our hands . 
I 'll try to move Min-hwan . 
I think he 's gotten it by now . 
What would UK send me ? 
What the heck ? 
I was fired . I have no money to pay for this . 
You may not have a reason to cover for me , but we can make a deal . 
I 'll take care of Su-min so she won 't bother you . 
Tell them to bring one more meal . 
Let 's eat first . 
So how will you take care of your wife ? 
I 'm broke , so I was going to kill myself . But there 's a way to live . 
And I think that might help you too . 
You can only get this after death . 
If Su-min disappears , there won 't be anyone to threaten you . 
It won 't be easy . We have to get our story straight . 
But can 't you help me ? 
You want me to clean up your mess ? Again ? 
Not just that . Set it up for me too . 
Money and connections are everything , but I don 't have any of them . 
You 've got guts . 
If you don 't have anything , you should at least have guts . 
But isn 't that all you have ? 
You think it was easy to decide ? 
This is my last resort . 
I 'll risk my life . 
This is your last chance . 
Park Min-hwan is at Oh Yu-ra 's suite right now . 
So it 's today . 
Park Min-hwan and Kang Ji-won are in room 1355 at Winton Hotel . 
Room 1355 . 
Room 1355 . 
Move . 
But I think you 're really smart , babe . 
But that is pretty genius . 
Going after your wife 's life insurance benefit ? 
How did you think of cancer insurance ? 
Once I get paid , I 'll treat you to something nice . 
Don 't worry . 
I know how to return the favor properly . 
Oh , my God ! 
Damn ... 
Whoever it is , this is ridiculous . 
Hey , Min-hwan . 
You 're a piece of trash that can 't be handled . 
What are you going to do about it ? 
Right ? 
I 'm going to send the voice recording to the police . 
Where 's my dad ? Did you kill him ? 
Kill him ? 
I thought you were trying to get Ji-won back . 
What are you doing here with her ? 
I heard you were fired . 
Since you have a lot of free time , spend it in jail . 
Are you insane ? 
Get lost ! 
Let go of me ! 
Let go ! 
Damn it ... 
What do I do now ? 
What do you mean ? 
We 'll go forward with your plan . 
But not here . 
I 'll set it up for you . 
Ms. Oh . 
If Park Min-hwan kills Jeong Su-min , set it up as murder for the insurance claim and distribute it to the media . 
I 'll get it ready , but ... 
Make sure whatever he says about me is nonsense . 
Get rid of all the evidence , got it ? 
What do you think you 're doing ? 
So why did you do something like that ? 
You 're great , but you don 't know your place . 
I have money . I 'll give it all to you . 
If you kill me , do you think she 'll leave you alone ? 
Su-min . I 'll give it to you . You really have hard evidence on Oh Yu-ra . 
But too bad for you . She erased it when you passed out . 
What ? 
You dummy . 
People like us shouldn 't go against people with power . 
What can we do ? 
And ... you have no money . 
What 's that ? 
It wasn 't your money anyway ! 
You stole it when you had the chance . 
You had the bag I bought for Ji-won . I sold that . To take care of urgent matters for me . 
Don 't be too upset . 
You said you wouldn 't go down alone . 
One of us has to die . 
So ... I have to take care of you to start over . 
Just wait . 
Hey ! Let me go ! 
Let me go ! 
Let me go ! 
Let me go ! 
Let me ... 
Let me go ! 
The gas ... 
Where did she go ? 
Are you crazy ? 
Leave the car key and move aside . 
Okay . Just calm down . 
Put the knife down ! Calm down ! 
I won 't die . 
I 'll never die ! 
Here . 
Here 's the key . 
Here it is . Put the knife down . 
Just take it ! 
Take it . Here . 
You little ... 
Come here . 
Come here ! 
My lovely wife 's going to die from carbon monoxide poisoning from a boiler malfunction while I 'm away to get groceries . 
So stop ruining my life . 
Just die already . 
Hey ! If you 're going to die , just die already . 
This is what the insurance was about ? 
You think it 'll go your way ? 
I think it will . 
Damn it ! 
My husband shouldn 't lose his manhood . 
Damn it ... 
You little ... 
No . 
Kang Ji-won told me that you were sterile . 
What are you talking about ? 
You 're shooting blanks ! 
Want me to spell it out ? 
I didn 't miscarry . 
I was never pregnant . 
Do you get it now ? 
I don 't think so . - You little ... 
- Let go , you bastard ! 
- Come here ! - Let go ! 
Let go of me ! 
- Get lost ! - Get lost ! 
I think Ms. Yang 's divorce suit will get easier . 
The evidence of the affair on the SD card , I don 't know why , but it 's been restored . 
- Suddenly ? 
The video didn 't work for no reason . It suddenly worked for no reason too . 
I guess they 're just meant to get a divorce . 
I checked the police report . 
He fell over a glass table and died after hitting his head . 
With the evidence , the police are looking for Jeong Su-min as the prime suspect . 
But the security cameras didn 't work , so they must find out what happened . 
Are you going ... to the funeral ? 
I thought about how nice it would be if you died . 
I thought I 'd burst of anger then . Back when those disappointing times were confirmed with despair and betrayal . 
You look so beautiful today . 
This little ... 
Get lost ! 
Just die . 
I spent all night wondering why you were like that to me . But it ended like this . 
How dare you come here ? 
If you didn 't betray Min-hwan , he never would 've married Su-min . 
She killed my son . 
That wench . 
She ruined my precious son 's life ! 
My poor boy ! 
At a pension in Gyeonggi Province on the 24th , Park , a man in his thirties , was found dead . 
The police confirmed his wife , Jeong , is the prime suspect . 
Isn 't this Jeong Su-min from marketing ? 
Don 't you remember ? 
No , they just look alike . 
Are you saying Min-hwan 's dead ? 
What ? Keep it down . 
I hear it 's him . 
Hey ... 
What 's this ? 
Park Min-hwan 's parents reported a theft . A thief came in while they were away . 
It was Jeong Su-min . 
That means she 's in Seoul . 
It 's been a day since the police put out an APB on Jeong Su-min , the prime suspect , but her exact whereabouts are still unknown . 
- The police - It 's fine . 
assume she 's off the grid and on the run and ask for the citizens ' active cooperation for the case . 
The suspect is 160 cm tall with a lean physique and under suspicion of killing her husband at a pension . 
But I feel uneasy . 
You 're too nice , so you wouldn 't know . 
Some people don 't know when to stop . 
Unless you stomp on them completely , they don 't stop . 
You can 't be the only one who 's happy , Ji-won . 
Never .
