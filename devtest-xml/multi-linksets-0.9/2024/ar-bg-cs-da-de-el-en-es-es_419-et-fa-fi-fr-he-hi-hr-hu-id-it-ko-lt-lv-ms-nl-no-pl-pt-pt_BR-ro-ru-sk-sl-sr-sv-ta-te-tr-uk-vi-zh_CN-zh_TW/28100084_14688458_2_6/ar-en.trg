What 's happening ? 
Raiders are holding back our deliveries . 
- Let them through ! - What deliveries ? 
All of ' em . Let them through ! Let them through ! 
Easy . 
I barely touched you . 
Does it hurt ? 
' Course it fucking hurts . 
We should get the whole crew in here . Let them see you crying about a scrape . 
- Can you keep it down ? 
- Thanks . - You owe me . 
Walk , we 'll get McLain back . 
She 's the head of Supply . She 's too important . 
She 's their enemy , just like us . So head of anything don 't mean nothing . 
That sheriff 's looking for you , so you better get moving . 
Yeah , looking for you too , Walk . 
Well , he 's gonna have an easy time then , isn 't he ? ' Cause I 'm not going anywhere . 
Who 's this ? 
Mark , this is Shirley . She 's twice the mechanic I 'll ever be . 
Well , that ain 't hard . 
I was wondering when you 'd be back . 
It 's , uh , quite the operation you got here . 
Yeah , we 're small , but we get it done . 
Lee . 
Shit . 
I asked Mark to turn away anyone asking him to make weapons . 
And make them only for you ? 
Raiders stopping deliveries , including food and ... that 's not all . 
I came in to do inventory for breakfast and noticed it on everything . 
Fruits . Vegetables . Meat . 
What is it ? Only one thing has that particular shade of blue . 
Rat poison . 
You sure ? 
Something else got here before I did . 
Point is , someone did this . 
Maybe this is connected to the food deliveries being stopped . 
I wouldn 't put it past Bernard , but that means someone down here is working for him . 
Either way , we 're gonna need a new plan . 
Let them through ! There is a truth , Mr. Amundsen , that has applied to human civilization from the before times until now . Only nine missed meals separate a functioning society from chaos . 
Who the fuck is that ? 
This is Felix . He 's been shadowing our doc . 
So you think just because I 'm a lowlife criminal that I ... I don 't need a doctor ? I just get a shadow ? No . Doc Phelan went to stay with family in the Mids . 
Of course he did . 
How old are you anyway , huh , kid ? 
You started shaving yet ? 
Have your fucking balls dropped ? 
The doctor wouldn 't have left if he didn 't think his shadow was ready . 
And you 're sure about that ? 
You can do this , right ? 
Just get the bullet out . 
Wait , wait , wait , hold on a second . Hold on one rat-fucking second . Aren 't you forgetting something ? 
Drugs , Felix . 
Before you go digging around , you need to give me drugs . And lots of them . 
Um , only doctors have the strong stuff . 
I 've got aspirin . 
He 's got aspirin . 
You 're really gonna arrest them ? Knox , Shirley , Walker ? 
I took an oath to protect the Pact . Knox and Shirley need to be brought in for their own good and the good of the Silo . 
I can help you find them , if that 's what you think we should do . 
Clearly , you don 't . 
It doesn 't matter what I think . 
When Sheriff Holston had me put my hand on the Pact , I swore an oath . 
Hank ... if they 're the solid citizens you say they are , they 'll turn themselves in . 
Let 's quiet down now ! 
Turn yourselves in ! Turn yourselves in ! 
Everyone , shut up ! 
You 've all heard what 's being said . That we killed Judge Meadows . 
I swear on my life , that 's a lie . 
We went up to talk and found her already dead . 
We were framed by Bernard Holland and Robert Sims , and we were lucky to make it back alive . 
How long are we gonna be alive ? 
I got two kids , and I 'll go hungry so they can eat , but what happens when there 's none left for them either ? 
Are you really gonna make our children starve for you ? 
It seems to me like they 've already won . 
Just look at us , ready to tear two of our own to pieces if they don 't give themselves up to die . 
You know , maybe you want me to go out there too . 
You could do that . But then , in a couple of days , you 'll see us all out there on that hill , fallen , where we tried to follow Jules . 
You 'll have your food deliveries though . 
You 'll have Bernard patting your heads saying , " Good job . Now get back to work . " 
Is that gonna feel like winning ? 
' Cause that 's the way it 's always been , but that doesn 't make it right . 
We 're Mechanical . We don 't fight over food , we share it . 
We don 't blame each other for shortages , we pool our resources , we tighten our belts , we ... 
We don 't wanna starve ! We don 't wanna starve ! 
Listen up ! Listen up ! Nobody 's starving . Not today . Teddy . 
As anyone who 's ever worked the scavenge room knows , not everything that comes down the chute is trash . 
" To our friends in Mechanical . Thanks for always keeping the power on . 
From your friends on 122 . Juliette lives . " 
Dr. Nichols ? 
Oh , Kathleen . 
What brings you here ? 
Uh , is Claire all right ? 
Claire is asleep , so I 'm fine . 
My husband needs a favor . 
Is he still down in Mechanical ? He is . 
There 's someone down there who needs a doctor . 
I think there 's a process for requesting a doctor through the sheriff 's department . 
He 'd rather not do it that way . 
Sir , we 're hearing Mechanical 's allies are dropping food down the trash chutes . 
Hmm , ahead of schedule , which is good news . 
It accelerates our time line . 
Post raiders at every chute access point . 
- Yes , sir . - Whatever food they received will run out soon enough . 
So , when we run out again , that 'll be it ? 
We surrender ? 
What level 's the barricade ? 130 . 
What if it was on 120 ? 
They are gonna need you down there . Now more than ever . 
All right . All right . All right ! 
You trying to break the damn door down ? 
I 'm not that deaf . 
Walker , this is Sheriff Billings . 
You were Juliette 's deputy . You here to arrest me ? 
First , I 'd like to ask you some questions about what happened to Judge Meadows . 
How should I know ? I didn 't go in . 
- Ask Knox and Shirley . - They must have told you what happened . 
Look , I 'm not talking about anybody , let alone Judge Meadows , until you find out where they 're holding McLain . 
Carla McLain . It 's , uh , head of Supply . 
I last saw her in the café on 70 . 
No doubt they 've taken her in by now . And I wanna know if she 's alive and unharmed . 
If so , I 'll talk to you . 
If not , guess you better find Knox and Shirley . - Wait . - I have questions about a murder ... 
I 'm a doctor . 
There 's a medical emergency . I was asked to help . 
Turn around . 
Sheriff Billings requested me . 
I don 't know anything about that , so you 're not getting through . 
Go back up . 
- A woman 's in labor . It 's an emergency . - Who are you ? Kathleen Billings . My husband is the sheriff . 
- Do you know what a C-section is ? 
It 's when they cut the baby out of the mother . 
There are two doctors in the Silo who can perform that operation . Dr. Nichols is one of them . 
Look , I got my orders ... If anything happens to this woman , you will be in violation of section 12 , subsection six of the Pact , " Denial of a citizen 's access to lifesaving health care . " 
Two coming through ! 
Well , and a baby ! 
Three coming through ! Back away ! You cross , you might not get back ! 
- Move ! Let 's go ! Move ! - Back up ! I said back up ! Move ! 
It 's okay . It 's okay . 
Stay back ! Back down now . 
At first , I tried shifting , uh , one letter forward , like every A is B , but that didn 't add up to anything . Then I thought , well , what if it 's ... i-if it 's one letter backwards ? 
That didn 't give you anything either . No . So , okay , I thought , well , what if it 's , you know , two or three letters off , you know ? Or even four or five ? 
And ... and so I started doing it all by hand , but ... but I thought , you know , - it 'd be faster to just write a program . 
- Smart . 
What you 're doing is called a Caesar shift , by the way . 
It 's ... It 's a long story . 
Keep at it . 
Mrs. Sims . 
Mayor Holland . 
Camille , I heard that you helped Judge Meadows 's murderers the other day . 
I answered a request for all former raiders to report for duty and help with the hunt . 
When I got to 90 , I noticed two citizens being harassed by some locals . 
I took them to a safe place . Then I radioed Judicial Security , told them where they were and to send an extraction team , and I 'd meet them on the stairs . Why didn 't you wait until the team got there ? 
Because no team was sent . 
I was told unofficially that justice needed to come from the citizens of the Silo . 
I was approached by a group of these citizens , several of them raiders I knew , now in civilian clothes , and they asked where I 'd stashed the two suspects . 
But you didn 't tell them . 
Of course not . 
I knew from my time in Judicial that vigilante justice is against the law . And we all have to obey the law . Yes . 
You know , it was your husband who instructed the crowd to go get them . 
I 'm curious what his response was when you told him about this . 
He 's the judge now . He understood . 
Of course he did . 
We 've got this for now . Come on ! 
Go get a hot meal in the cafeteria . We got this . 
What the actual fuck ? 
Radio Amundsen . We need tactical defense equipment . 
- Tactical defense ? - Guns . We need guns . 
Mr. Amundsen . This is Unit 19 . 
This is Amundsen . Go . Sir , there may be a situation brewing here . 
We need advanced tactical defense equipment . 
Fuck . - Sir , my aunt on 135 just ... 
- Not now . 
- Where 's the patient ? - Okay , he 's over there . 
Thank you . 
Honey . 
Honey , what are you doing ? 
Dr. Nichols could use my help . I told you , it 's not safe down here . 
Paul , it 's not safe anywhere . 
Uh , very touching family reunion . But you think maybe we could get this fucking bullet out ? That 'd be great . 
Hey , come here . Hey . Hey . 
I missed you . 
See Mama ? 
Are you looking around ? 
Why am I here , Diego ? 
Mechanical is massing for an assault on the barricade . 
They have weapons and armor ... I 'm sure Mr. Amundsen is aware . 
He is , but he doesn 't know what I know . 
We have been relying on listeners since the cameras below 120 went out . 
I don 't trust ' em . Someone I do trust is my aunt . 
She 's on 135 , and she sent a message saying a bunch of Down-Deepers were marching up with weapons ... Didn 't you already tell me that ? 
She said there was a second group heading the other direction . They had weapons and a saw . 
My aunt 's in construction . She said it was the kind of saw they use to cut through concrete . 
Clear . 
Sorry to bo ... What the fuck are you doing here ? 
You 're supposed to be in the mines . 
Mayor Holland needed my help . 
With what ? 
Some-Some programming . 
Where is he ? 
I don 't know . 
Can you feel this , Mr. Kennedy ? 
Yeah , I can . I just don 't care . 
There it is . 
You think they have a team cutting up through the floor ? 
And neither Amundsen nor Bernard know ? 
There 's nothing wrong with letting people suffer their own mistakes . 
As long as the mistake doesn 't endanger everyone else , including our son . 
You can 't do anything . You 're the judge now . 
I know . Besides , I was never a raider . 
- What are they doing ? - We can 't see . Sounds like they were drilling . 
Yeah , I know what drilling sounds like , Derek . 
Where are the guns ? 
Just leaving the armory . 
It didn 't get your lung . 
You 're a lucky man . 
Mmm , yes , sir . That 's me . Mr. Lucky . 
I held up my end of the deal , Mr. Kennedy . 
Let 's talk . 
You were being serious ? 
I just wanted to get the bullet out . 
Come on now , Mr. Kennedy . 
Deputy Hank took time out of his busy day to hear what you have to say . 
I 'm feeling a little woozy , what with the drugs and having a bullet dug out of me . You know , maybe tomorrow . 
Bandage all good ? 
I 'll take her . 
Here you go . 
Dr. Nichols , I 'd like a word with the patient . 
You should probably go too , Hank . 
Maybe he should stay . You know , taking all that time and everything . 
I 'll fill him in . 
Oopsie . Looks like I made Daddy mad . 
Not really . 
You 're a criminal . 
I don 't expect much . But I need what I need , which is you telling me what you said you were going to tell me . 
' Cause if you don 't ... I 'll radio Judge Sims . 
What ? 
That 's right . He 's Judge now . 
I 'll tell him where you are , and who knows ? Maybe he 'll put you back in that box . 
Or worse . 
You 're not gonna wanna hear what I have to say . 
- Why ? 
- Because it 'll ruin your fucking life . 
When Nichols was on the run , you happen to be near a computer when they went dark ? 
- Do you know why they went dark ? 
- It was a systems reboot . 
That 's what they said , but they say all kinds of shit . 
They went dark because Nichols had my friend Danny put something on every computer in the Silo for ten seconds before they shut it down . 
What 'd he put up ? 
I bet they rounded up everybody who saw it . Me and Danny ... Who knows what the hell they did to him ? 
They gagged and bagged us so we couldn 't tell anything to anybody . 
Tell anyone what , man ? 
It 's like the page ... only a million times more beautiful . 
I couldn 't describe it if I fucking tried . 
Where does Sims come into this ? 
Not long after Nichols gets sent out , Sims comes to me , wants to make a deal . 
I put on dirty clothes , head down to Greasetown , toss a firebomb at Hank 's station . In return , he 'd ... he 'd give me drugs . Make me forget everything that 's happened to me in the last 22 years . 
Obviously , he never intended to hold up his end . 
And the magic forgetting drugs are probably bullshit , but I didn 't have a lot of options with a hood over my head . 
Now , let me ask you a question . 
Isn 't there just a little piece of you that wishes I never told you that ? 
If our roles were switched , would you have done the same ? 
What if I failed , Mary ? 
140 years of stability , and it could all end on my watch . 
I ... I made the calculations , I ... I planned for everything . 
Then ... ... events forced me to factor you in ... to the calculation . 
For that , I 'm ... ... I 'm truly sorry . 
Set up a tactical formation here . 
Two lines . Now ! 
- What are you doing ? 
- There 's gonna be an ambush . 
- From where ? 
- They 're coming up through the floor . 
What ? 
This is our level ! 
Guys ! 
Over there ! 
Now ! 
They 're gonna pinch us . Fall back ! Go ! 
Go , go , go ! Come on ! Come on ! 
Stop ! 
You will kill ten of us ... but we will kill all of you ... and take the stairs . 
How about we make this level the new boundary ? That work ? 
Mr. Mayor , it wasn 't optimum , but they only got ten floors . 
" Not optimum . " What level is the new barricade on ? 
One t ... 120 . 
And what is down on level 122 ? 
Without looking at a map . Anyone ? 
What 's on 122 ? 
Uh , lower Mids farm ... farm . It 's a farm level . 
We 're trying to starve them into submission and now they have a farm . So , yeah , not optimum . 
I heard there was some kind of a battle on the stairs . 
Shouldn 't you be there ? I 've been busy finding out what happened to Carla McLain . 
She was arrested at that café on 70 . 
Yeah , where I left her . 
So , where is she now ? 
People usually get transferred to us for processing , but Hank 's checked in with every deputy station . None of them have her . 
So , where is she ? 
In a hospital ? 
Sometimes , when raiders have a high-profile , high-risk suspect , they 're taken into seclusion . 
No , they can 't do that . No , Carla has health issues . She won 't survive . 
Look , you 're the sheriff . You can do something . 
I might be able to get her out , but only if I can clear her name . So , please , what happened to Judge Meadows ? 
Hell of a plan today . Well , haven 't you heard ? I 'm twice the mechanic you 'll ever be . 
What idiot told you that ? 
Which means twice the thinker , twice the engineer . 
See , this is why I don 't give people compliments . 
To teamwork . 
To great partners . 
Uh , we under arrest , Sheriff ? 
Martha Walker has given me her account of what happened with Meadows . 
Or at least what she says you told her . 
That you walked in and found the judge dead . 
You said Bernard Holland and Robert Sims were framing you . 
Would you swear on the Pact that 's true ? 
Every word . 
Sheriff Billings for Mayor Holland . 
Sheriff Billings for Mayor Holland . 
Speaking . 
I 've located the fugitives . 
Excellent news , Sheriff . Thank you . Where are they ? 
I 'm not revealing their location at this time . First , I need to open a full investigation into the events leading to the death of Judge Meadows , - as well as a new investigation ... - Disable all radio communication - in the Silo . Now . - ... attack on the deputy station in the Down Deep , which cost two lives , and ... Fuck me . I just lost the sheriff . 
Mayor ? 
Thank you . 
For what ? 
I don 't stand with the mayor , or the judge , or you . 
I stand with the law . 
Paul , you okay ? 
- You did a very brave thing today . 
Brave ? Maybe . 
Stupid ? Definitely . 
I doubt I 'll be sheriff much longer . 
It wasn 't stupid and it was the right thing . 
People will see that . 
I 'm not sure it was right either . 
When was the last time you took your herbs ? 
I 'm sorry , honey , I forgot . I 'm not criticizing . 
- Can you pass me that glass of water ? - Right , yeah . 
What are you ... Look . 
Why do you think that is ? 
I ... You haven 't taken your herbs in days . 
But I don 't know what 's changed . 
Maybe you have . 
So , this is Quinn 's code , but with the alphabet reversed and shifted three letters over . 
Doesn 't look like anything . 
It 's gobbledygook . 
Right , uh , except here ... " Sillo . " 
I doubt that Salvador Quinn would spell " silo " wrong . 
I thought ... I thought the same . Um , so , okay . Here 's another iteration , still reversed , but shifted over ten . 
" Allie . " 
Quinn 's daughter 's name was Allie . You might be onto something . 
Right . Except that none of the other words , you know , are coherent . 
Well , this is far beyond a Caesar shift . 
This is sophisticated . It 's a code within a code . 
In order to decipher it , you would have to ... What ? 
You 'd have to see the Legacy . 
Legacy ? I ... I don 't know what that is . 
Stand up . Stand up ! 
Lukas Kyle , I am electing you to be my shadow . 
Please place your right hand on the Pact . 
Do you accept ? 
Yes . 
Repeat after me . 
I , Lukas Kyle ... If you 're a friend , come in . If not , go away . 
I hope you still consider me a friend . 
It 's been a long time . 
I wanted to thank you for taking care of her all these years . 
Oh , you know , it was her who took care of us . 
One of the engineers told me you managed to have a different tape used for Juliette 's cleaning . 
Is that true ? Yes . 
That 's why she was able to walk out of sight ? 
Do you think she 's still alive ? 
Then why give us false hope ? 
I did it for her , Doctor . And for you and me , and for everyone down here who knew and loved her , and , yeah , some days wanted to strangle her . 
I did it because I knew she wouldn 't want any of us to watch her dying on that hill . 
But you don 't think she 's still alive . 
I don 't see how . 
You 're awake . Good . 
Um , you had an infection . It was a bad one . 
Nice to know that those antibiotics worked . 
I-I made ' em all by myself not too long ago . 
I got a helmet . 
Where is it ? I need to go . I need to get my suit on . 
Um , yeah , about the suit ... It ... It 's safe . You 're gonna get it back . First , I need you to fix that pump . 
What ? 
You said that if you could get power - to the pump under the surface ... - No . ... you could stop the water from rising . Get me my suit . 
All right . Well think of it as doing me a favor , like ... like , I saved your life , you save mine , and then we 'll be even . 
- Even ? - Yeah . You 're one person . There 's 10,000 fucking people ... Yeah , 10,000 people that could die any day now . Just like the people of this silo died . Look , you can waste time arguing with me or you can start thinking about how you 're gonna fix that pump . 
It 's up to you .
