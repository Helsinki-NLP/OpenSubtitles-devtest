People would fly high above the crowd , just flipping , like , end over end , like ... And into the arms of a person waiting on the other side . 
Isn 't that wild ? 
Another thing about the circus , they had animals and they had these huge things called elephants and they had , like , skin as hard as concrete and these long , flexible noses that they called trunks , 
and teeth that grew on either side of their faces could grow up to 12 feet long . 
That sounds like a nightmare . Yeah , I like elephants . 
They 're really smart . They 're very altruistic . 
You know , they 've been known to help other species in trouble . 
Well , right now I 'm a species in trouble . 
What ? 
I want to try and breathe through 50 feet of tubing without having to make something to push the air down . But I don 't think I can . Can you take that ? 
And . I think I can fix it . 
Hey , you 're pretty good at making things ? So , what was your job at your silo ? 
- Hey , could you ... just lo ... thank you . - Sorry . 
I was an engineer . 
Hey , you know , they used machines to breathe underwater in the before times . 
There 's this great book called twenty thousand leagues under the sea , and in it they use breathing equipment and this massive underwater ship called the nautilus to explore the ocean floor . The ocean was this vast expanse of salt wa no , I know . I 've seen it . 
- I 've seen it in a book . 
- They let you read books in 18 ? 
No . Man . 
Wait . Where was I ? Yeah . 
In the book , the captain of the nautilus - is Nemo ... - No . - And you 're a little bit like him . - Can you just sorry . 
Hey . - Hey . - Yeah ? You could use a harmonium . 
- It 's a musical instrument . 
- No , I need something to write on . 
I need like , a piece of slate or it 's ... this is not there 's a chalkboard in the same room . - Come on . 
- Let 's do that . - Should I grab ... here . 
When we were kids , I used to think these were the names of the founders . Now , I think they 're the people from mechanical who died in rebellions . 
I think the rebellion we grew up hearing about was just the last one . And before that , they happened every generation . 
And you don 't want mechanical to start another one ? 
If we started any of them . 
Look , all right ? 
Look what they wrote next to the names . 
" Started with food shortage in the farms . " 
And then ... it looks like , " blamed on mechanical . " 
You see ? 
" Factory workers shut down . " 
" Trash chute fire . " And look at this . Look , it 's hard to see , but 
" no matter where rebellion started , the finger always pointed at mechanical . " 
Why ? Why is that ? 
Because we can shut this fucker down . 
That 's right . 
You 're not ready for that . Us shutting it down ? 
If it gets us what we really need and we 've exhausted all of our 
- they killed Cooper . 
- I know ! 
And they sent Jules out to clean . 
But , shirl , other than revenge , what do we want ? 
The truth . 
So let 's fucking demand it . 
I 'm the head of mechanical . I can get a meeting with the mayor . We take a small group . You , me , Walker , maybe mclain , the head of supply . And we go up . 
No crowds , no weapons . 
Every step we take will be considered an act of aggression . 
Which is why we send a message to the mayor first . Laying out exactly what we want to talk about . Not the mayor . The judge . 
Jules told Walker that meadows is an empty robe . 
But the silo doesn 't know that . 
As far as everyone 's concerned , judge meadows is the boss . 
I 'll send her the message . 
Is it true a gang from mechanical is going to meet with judge meadows ? 
- Hardly a gang . 
- Let me stop them . - I have 50 raiders on 110 . - No , Rob . 
We 're gonna let them air their grievances . Maybe it 'll bring down the temperature . 
The ultimate goal is to stop a rebellion . - I don 't care how . - Every level they climb is one level closer to the air lock . 
What happens if they rush the stairs ? 
Two of this gang are old ladies . 
They 're not gonna make a run for the air lock . But put some raiders above judicial if you want . 
This isn 't the only reason the judge concerns me . 
She also agreed to meet with Lukas Kyle . He requested a hearing about his sentence . If she let 's him go , that 's not good . I agree . What do you want me to do about it ? 
I was hoping you could have a word with her . 
I know you 've been talking to her . 
You 've been tracking that ? 
Just an observation . 
Well , the next time I speak with her , I 'll be sure to raise your concerns . 
You agreed to meet with some mechanicals ? They 're citizens of the silo who want to speak to their judge . 
- It sends a bad message . 
- No , Bernard , it sends a new message . 
You also agreed to hear Lukas Kyle 's petition ? 
He has a right to request a review . 
And you have a right to refuse it . 
What are you so afraid of ? 
- He 's dangerous . 
- Well , now I really want to meet him . 
- I 'm being serious . - No , you 're not . Because if you were being serious , you would have brought my cleaning suit . 
- Do you have it ? - It 's being assembled ! 
Well , then when you have my suit , we can talk . 
Hey , what are all these numbers ? 
- No idea . 
- Okay , I 'm gonna need some room . 
Erase them . I don 't think anyone will mind . 
Founders ' day . 
It was a week before founders ' day that it all happened . 
Hey , did you have founders ' day in your silo ? No . 
Did you have any holidays ? 
We had freedom day . 
What did that celebrate ? 
Freedom , solo . Yeah . Sorry . 
Lapis ... She used to sit next to me . 
She was a funny girl . 
She was always making noises and cracking me up . 
Her mom ... She would jar peach preserves . 
She said that her name meant blue or something . But I think she just said that because that was her favorite color and she really liked my blue eyes . 
Solo ? 
This is a level b classroom ? 
So she would have been 11 or 12 when the rebellion started . 
So , how were you sitting next to her ? 
Well , I didn 't mean that this belonged to lap is . 
What happened to your eye ? 
Was that during the rebellion or ... 
Yeah , that 's something I don 't like to talk about . 
Do ... I forgot . Do you see this ? 
Have you seen this or something like this ? 
Can I show you ? 
I can pack more ginger in case you 're gone longer . 
- You 're worried . - Of course I am . There 's a mob from mechanical on their way up . 
It 's only a few people the judge agreed to see and I trust her . 
If you want , I can ask a deputy to stay . 
I don 't want a deputy . I want you . 
If I can help keep the peace down there , then none of us will have anything to worry about . 
I 'll ask somebody to stop by and I will come back as soon as I can . 
You get them ? 
My dogs were pissed . But yeah . I got ' em . 
You want to see ? 
I know red from green . Okay , then . 
You could get literally anyone to do this . 
Let me come with you . For Coop . 
We said four people . Not five . 
I could stay here . 
Sleep in my own bed . Catch you guys on the way back down . 
Suit yourself . 
Meadows wasn 't always a drunk . 
When I was in judicial , I heard stories about her mind . The best there ever was . 
Then I don 't know . Something happened . I never heard what . 
I had a thought . 
This might be a step too far , but the pact outlines three grounds for impeaching a judge . 
Proven misbehavior , incapacity to act , - or endangering the silo . - Endangering the silo . Impeachment ? 
- That could be very destabilizing . 
- Or it could unite the upper half . 
I 'll need support from a majority of levels and departments . 
I don 't know if there 's time to gather enough signatures to stop the meeting . You don 't need signatures . 
You only need the threat of impeachment to send a message to Bernard . 
He 's the one to sideline her . If he does , maybe he goes back to seeking your counsel . 
Solo , could you just stop ? - Stop . - No . 
You gotta listen . 
I 'm trying to figure this out and you 're playing music . And it 's just in my head . 
Yeah but how do you think I 'm playing the music ? 
I don 't care ! 
Yes , you do . 
Just ... I 'm trying to show you something . Will you just come over here , please ? Just one time and I won 't mention it again . I promise . 
- Just play . - Okay . 
No , not my hands . Look at my feet . 
- Yeah . - See ? There 's a bellows inside that pushes air through a valve . 
You could use this to push air down a tube . 
I 'm gonna have to take it apart . 
Yeah , but you could put it back together again , right ? I don 't know . Maybe . Why don 't you just play one last time , okay ? - Just ... - man . 
Well , we 'll see . 
When a team of agents showed up at Nichols 's apartment , you fled . 
- Is that correct ? 
- Yes , but there it is again , " yes , but ... " 
" Yes , I held the red-level relic , but it wasn 't in my possession . " 
If you don 't deny the facts of your case , Mr. Kyle , why are you requesting a review of your sentence ? 
Let me guess . The reason , put simply , is ... It 's not fair . 
Would that be accurate ? 
What 's this made of ? 
Metal . 
And where do we get the ore to make the metal ? 
- The mines . 
- The mines are critical to our survival . But the work is hard and it 's dangerous and nobody wants to do it . 
So you have to do it . You and others like you who have fallen afoul of the pact . 
Just because you 'll be wearing yellow coveralls doesn 't mean that you won 't be of vital service to the silo . 
May I ask you a question ? 
If you must . 
Why did you even Grant this request for a review ? 
Agents , get out . 
Why do you think ? 
To see if I knew what was on the hard drive . No . 
I wanted to know about the lights in the night sky . 
What are they ? 
- I don 't know . 
- Tell me what you think you know . 
They move . 
Actually , we move . 
We move ? 
What do you think that means ? 
I think we live on a ball . 
A massive one and it rotates , giving the impression that the lights move . But they don 't . It 's the same with the sun . 
It doesn 't move , we do . 
We spin , and that gives us day and then night . 
The lights in the sky are called stars . 
And they are massive spheres of gas . And they shine from an energy called radiation . Which makes them perpetual balls of fire . 
And you 're right . The world rotates and revolves around the sun . 
And the sun is just one of billions of these stars . 
How do you know this ? 
And wait , are there actually other worlds that rev agents . 
Lukas Kyle , due to your forthrightness and your willingness to accept responsibility , I will amend your sentence to five years in the mines . 
May the founders have mercy on you . - Remove him . 
- No , but ... 
Impeach judge meadows ! Impeach her ! - Impeach her ! - Impeach judge meadows ! 
It shouldn 't rub quite so much anymore . Thank you . 
You all right ? 
Why ? 
You didn 't come out of your hole for 25 years . 
Now you 're out all the time . 
When I went up those stairs to get that tape for Juliette , I was scared spit less . 
Then I saw you ... And I started thinking about all those years I wasted . 
We wasted . 
And I couldn 't remember why . 
At least any why that was worth a damn . 
If meadows goes for it , sending people out to look around , come back ... Yeah ? 
Would you volunteer ? 
In a heartbeat . - You ? - Yeah . 
What would you want to see ? 
The distance . 
And Juliette . 
This not knowing ... It 's fucking killing me . 
I didn 't think you liked her . 
She annoyed the living shit out of me ... But I knew that I could trust her with my life . 
Looks like we got company . 
You gotta be kidding me . 
I 'll handle this . 
Deputy , is everything all right ? 
You heading up to judicial ? 
Yeah , we got a right to walk like everyone else . 
We 're not here to stop you . We 're here to make sure - you get there safely . - Why ? Sheriff billings asked us to . 
No , but why does he think that we need because you may have a lot of friends below here , but above people might be throwing shit . 
Literally . 
We 'll peel off a couple of levels below judicial . 
They see a sheriff 's escort , they might think we 've chosen sides . 
So you 'll leave us just when things are likely to get bad ? 
I mean , I 'm a civilian . So yeah . 
Let 's get on with it then . 
The firebomb hit here . 
We all scattered . 
The fire didn 't get inside . 
Where was the shooter ? Right there . 
Retired raider . 
Reggie smalls . 
Says he was just reacting as trained . 
The asshole with the firebomb ? 
Over there . 
A local kid Cooper was running in to try and stop the guy . 
- Anybody recognize him ? - No . 
I 'd like to see him . 
I wish you could . Judicial hauled him up this morning . 
- They give a reason ? - No . When I asked , they just gave me that look , you know that judicial look . 
I used to be in judicial . I 'm sorry . - I didn 't ... - no . I know that look only too well . Right . 
You still have Cooper 's body ? 
You can start . I think that works . 
Solo ? Pump . Pump hard . 
Okay , that 's not good enough . Stop . 
Okay . I think if I 
- maybe ... - I gotta go back to the vault . 
What ? 
Why ? I think I left it unlocked . 
Well , there 's no one here . 
I think we 're okay . 
No , I think I gotta go check it . 
No , it 's okay . I saw you . You locked it . - I don 't think so . - No , but you did . You closed the door and it locked . 
- You 're just saying that . - No ! Wait , what are you doing ? You locked the vault . 
Yeah , I locked it . 
Was it you ? 
Absolutely not . 
I 'm to believe that an effort to impeach me just arose spontaneously ? 
People are afraid , and they get more afraid with every step that a group of mechanicals takes toward the air lock . 
You should have read the letter that they sent . All they want is to build better suits and to send a few people out to explore and come back . 
Just a little exploration . That 's everything about that is prohibited by the pact . 
I wasn 't going to agree to it . I was gonna say we 'd form a committee to study these ideas . 
And kill it with bureaucracy . Yes . 
I 'm . I 'm sorry about the impeachment talk . 
Look , I don 't care . 
I 'll be long gone before it could happen . 
Would you come to my apartment ? 
For dinner . Tonight . 
- Why ? 
- We need to talk about next steps . 
My next steps are out the air lock . I 'll have your suit . You can try it on . 
Come at 7 : 00 ? 
The mechanicals won 't be up here until 9 : 00 . Okay . 
I spoke to Lukas Kyle . 
You 're right . He is dangerous . 
Then why did you cut his sentence in half ? 
To make it seem like we 're fair . 
Besides , someone like him , do you really think he could last more than a year in the mines ? 
I 'll see you tonight . 
If the mob don 't grab me and throw me over the rail . 
- Can you try again ? - Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay , I think that 'll work . 
Are you okay ? 
Yeah . I 'll be fine . I 'll just have to get across the alleyway into the room and I 'll be fine . I 've done worse . Okay , so when I 'm underwater , just make sure you don 't stop pumping , I know . Yeah . Okay . 
There 's no body , Hank . Judicial took it . 
No , we don 't want to see the asshole with the firebomb . We wanna see Coop . 
No , that 's what I 'm telling you . They took Coop . What ? 
Why ? 
They said they were here for a body and the only one here was Coop . 
- So they took him . 
- No . I tried to explain , but they were judicial . 
There were two bodies here yesterday . 
Not this morning . 
So , what happened ? 
I don 't know . You don 't know ? 
- Well , did you lock the door last night ? - Yes , I locked the door . 
- You think I 'm an idiot ? - I don 't know , juno . - You had two bodies here yesterday ... - the one that 's missing , describe it . 
It was a guy , about 40 . 
Medium build . Big beard . Long hair . 
Yeah . You 'll be okay , captain Nemo . 
Satie ? I remember you liked him . 
The vault . 
Come on . 
Hey . I gotta go back to the vault . 
- It 's okay . Okay , wait . - No . - Wait . Hey ! - Now ! - I gotta go back to the vault . 
- Wait . 
No ! Look , I 'm in charge . I 'm responsible . Okay . Fuck me . 
- It 's locked . 
- Yeah ? - Yeah . - You feel better ? 
- Yeah . - Okay . I 'm gonna go back inside . 
What ? 
You okay ? Yeah . 
What happened ? 
Well , maybe you got the number wrong . 
What did you do ? 
- I didn 't do anything . - No , you messed with it . - You want to keep me out . - I 've been with you the whole time ! I have one more try and then I 'm locked out . 
Calm ... hey ! Just ... no , I shouldn 't have left . It 's safe in there . 
- Maybe you should write it down . - Shut up ! Okay . 
See ? I didn 't do anything . 
- Stay back . - Solo . 
I actually trained for that race . Thirty minutes a day . If you 'd trained two hours a day , you still would have lost . 
You 're an asshole . 
Well , as not unpleasant as this has been . I would like to try on my suit . 
You said it would be here by now . 
I know it wasn 't in the wine . 
I wasn 't sure you would drink it . 
It was the mushrooms . 
- How long do I have ? 
- Minutes rather than hours . 
Why ? 
I must follow the order . 
You have a way that my death will serve that ? 
It will unite the silo . 
Mary , I 'm sorry . 
That hard drive that Juliette Nichols had , where is it ? 
I destroyed it . 
Why ? 
What was on it ? If I need to know something , then you have to even if you did know , there 's nothing that you can do about it . 
All I can say is that ... It had something to do with Salvador Quinn . 140 years ago , when he was head of it - during the rebellion ? - Yes . He wrote a letter . Part of it was in code . 
- What did it say ? 
- I can 't tell you , Bernard . - But you deciphered it , didn 't you ? - Stop . 
- I said I can 't . 
Twenty-five years ago , when I told you why I had to step down as your shadow , I said you said you didn 't want to be tethered to me for the rest of your life . 
Which was a lie . 
I would happily have been by your side , but I knew that you could never give yourself fully to me . 
Why did you lie ? 
I didn 't dare tell you the truth . 
You vanished for four days . When you came back , you quit . Where did you go ? 
Please , can I just go to the cafeteria just one more time ? Just to see the outside again . One more time . 
No . 
But I have something . 
Did you ever use this when you sat with the legacy ? No . It lets you see things . Somewhat like what people that are sent out to clean see in their helmets . Only this is real . 
Did you ever read about Costa Rica ? 
This was from Costa Rica . 
The monteverde cloud forest biological reserve , 2018 . 
Tilt your head up a little bit to the left . 
See that little fella lounging on the vine ? 
That is a white-faced capuchin monkey . 
Now watch . 
It 's gonna leap from the vine to the tree on your right . 
Now , look down and to your right . Yeah . 
That is a red-eyed tree frog . 
- Do you see it ? - Yeah . 
Bright colors are a defense mechanism . 
The green is camouflage . It allows it to blend into its surroundings to avoid predators . 
Quick , look up . 
Now , at the top of the trees . Look . That 's a flock of quetzal birds . 
You can tell they 're males by their twin tail feathers . 
So beautiful . It 's wonderful . So beautiful . 
What did they do , Bernard ? 
How did they lose this world ? 
I thought we were past this , solo . 
You know when I was sent out to clean , I. I was so tired . Like there was a part of me that was it sounds really weird but , like . I was relieved that it was finally fucking over . 
You know ? 
And then when I got outside , I was really . I was really f ... lonely . And . I was so scared . 
I was really fucking scared . 
Every step , I. I thought , like , " this is it . " Like , this is this is where I collapse . 
" Like , this is where I die . " And I , 
but I didn 't . You know , I kept walking . 
I didn 't know what else to do . 
So I know what it 's like to be scared , solo . You 're not you 're not the only one . 
Solo ? 
Captain Nemo would like to know more about that place . 
What do you call it ? 
The circus . Do you wanna tell me about that ? You could also ... you could tell me about the the things with the long noses . 
I don 't remember what they were called . 
They 're called elephants . 
And then , they also had cats , but they weren 't like our cats . 
These were huge , and they could grow up to , like , 400 pounds . 
They were called lions . 
They would train them to jump through hoops of fire . 
- Really ? - Yeah . 
Do exactly as I instructed . 
I 'll meet you there . 
Molly , when everyone was trying to get Nichols , you took two men into custody . 
Yeah , Danny something . 
Bly . And Kennedy . Patrick Kennedy . 
What happened to them ? Judicial took ' em . Hard . Gagged ' em and bagged ' em . 
Kennedy had a big beard and long hair ? 
Yeah . Why ? We 're working on something . Take care . 
The bearded guy , did a doctor say he was dead ? 
No . Not officially . But he wasn 't moving when they took him away . 
- Where was he shot ? - Right here . 
No . Wait . 
Here . 
Judge meadows is expecting us ! 
We 're here on official judicial business ! - Let us through . - Just trying to do my job . Get back ! These animals wanna kill the silo . 
You with us or with them ? 
Sorry , judicial is closed today . 
We 're not leaving until we see the judge . You are leaving . 
Either back down the stairs or over the side . 
Red ball ! 
Five , four , three , two , one . 
The power stays out until we see the judge . 
Move . 
Mr. Mayor . Mr. Knox . I see you 've turned off the power . 
Bring out judge meadows , we 'll turn it back on . 
She 's not feeling well , but I believe I can get you in to see her if you turn the lights back on . 
Just you two . 
What the fuck ? 
They set us up . 
No . Listen to me . Knox , we need to go . Now . 
I 'm not stopping you . 
You sure about this ? 
I have raiders right outside . 
The people of the silo have to take care of this themselves . 
- We can 't run . 
- We have to run . There are 50 raiders and a hundred angry assholes out there . 
We walk until we get to Walker and mclain . 
- Then we run ! - Then we fucking run ! 
We have to leave . 
Quick , but don 't look scared . 
I wasn 't , until you said that . 
The push to impeach judge meadows was unexpected . 
It forced my hand . 
Made this necessary . 
I believe good will come of it . 
Still . I know you were behind it , Rob . 
Don 't let ' em get too much of a head start . You wouldn 't want to lose them . 
Silence ! 
I know some of you many of you ... Didn 't like judge meadows meeting with some down-deepers . 
She only met with them because , in her words , every citizen of the silo deserves a hearing . 
Well , it seems she miscalculated horribly . 
Those animals from mechanical just killed her . 
They wanted to open the air lock . And judge meadows refused . 
She gave her life for the silo ! 
For you ! 
For me ! 
It is now the duty of every citizen to find those murderers and bring them to justice ! 
Justice ! Justice !
