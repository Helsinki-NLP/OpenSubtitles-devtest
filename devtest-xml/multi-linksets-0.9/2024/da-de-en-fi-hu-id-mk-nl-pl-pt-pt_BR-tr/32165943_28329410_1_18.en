The Fable 
Cheerio 
[ Akira ] Did you get the info on that murder ? 
As always , you show up around dinner time . 
[ Akira ] That 's because I just got off work . 
I 'm having curry today . Want some ? 
I 'll see when it 's done . 
Dang , you tick me off . 
I memorized all the murders in June from four years ago . 
Tell me which it is . 
[ Yoko ] June 4 , a burglar broke into a pub ... 
[ Akira ] Nope . 
- [ Yoko ] June 10 , a man taking a walk ... 
- [ Akira ] Nope . 
- [ Yoko ] June 11 , two university students ... - Nope . 
June 20 , at a parking structure ... 
That 's it . 
Kenji Kawahira , age 28 , had his throat slit with a knife . 
[ Yoko ] Then he took a dive three floors from a parking structure . 
Kawahira died . 
There was a girl riding with him , about age 15 or 16 . 
Hinako Saba , age 16 . 
She was a runaway . 
[ Yoko ] Hinako Saba was seriously injured in the accident . 
After running away , she must have gotten involved with some scum . 
She can only blame herself though . But considering her age , I feel sorry for her . 
It wasn 't like that . 
[ Akira ] It took me two seconds to break the glass , slit the guy 's throat , and look inside . 
- [ breathing shakily ] - The girl was already crying . 
- You can 't cry in two seconds . 
I also killed the guy taking a walk on June 10 . 
What ? 
That too ? 
If I remember correctly , I had three targets in the prostitution business . 
Prostituting girls ? 
Didn 't you look into that stuff ? 
I basically stick to doing my job . 
Well ... [ slurps ] I guess I 'm the same way too . 
I see . 
That must be from that accident . 
[ Yoko ] So , are you going to have my curry ? 
- [ Akira ] Yeah . 
- [ Yoko ] You are ? 
[ Kainuma ] There 's no going back now . 
I 've made up my mind . 
I 'm through living a boring life . 
Like always , I 'll use my spare key to get inside . 
When Misaki gets home , - I 'll knock her out . 
I 'll cover her mouth in duct tape and tie her up with rope . 
Then maybe I 'll even film her . 
I 'll take this chance to let everything out on her . 
I 've ended up like this because of society . 
In fact , it 's all that moron Sato 's fault . 
I was satisfied with just peeping . 
- [ lock rattling ] - [ Kainuma ] Huh ? 
Wait ! What the heck ? 
What 's going on ? The key doesn 't fit ! 
No way ! 
Did she change the lock ? 
You 've got to be kidding . 
After all the prep I 've done ... - After making up my mind ... [ gasps ] - [ footsteps approaching ] [ breathing nervously ] 
Good evening . 
So , I wonder what 's upstairs . 
" Misaki Shimizu . " 
[ inhales sharply ] I 've heard that name before . 
She 's that bikini model Kuro was involved with about three years ago . 
That chicken , huh ? 
Nice . I like it . 
- ♪ Right on your shoulders ♪ - [ Akira whistling along ] 
♪ You now feel it ♪ 
♪ Getting stiff just like ♪ 
- ♪ Dandruff falling on your shoulders ♪ - [ whistling continues ] 
♪ I can 't ... ♪ 
A stun gun and duct tape . 
That guy 's really messed up in the head . 
Kainuma was ludicrously overprotected as a child . 
His mom bought him everything he wanted . 
If you keep that up until a kid becomes an adult , they become an utter fool . 
[ Utsubo ] They think that the whole world revolves around them . 
When they get like that , it 's perfect . 
I appreciate the parents for raising such total idiots . 
There was once a TV commercial for a cooling spray set at a sports meet . 
Kainuma 's mom complained right away to the TV station . 
She said her son 's bad at sports , so the commercial hurt his feelings . 
What ? Are you serious ? 
There really are monster mothers like her . 
Now that things in the real world haven 't gone his way , he 's gotten tripped up . And now Kainuma 's become a bona fide stalker . 
He saw my face . 
[ Utsubo ] Good point . 
Let Suzuki take over with handling Kainuma . 
Okay . 
By the way , where is Mr. Suzuki ? 
I contacted you because I heard you 'd moved here recently . 
I never thought you 'd actually come . 
Yeah , well , I 've got some questions for you too . 
It was good timing . 
You get plastic surgery again ? 
I heard you 're Utsubo 's lapdog . 
He doesn 't own me . 
It 's an exclusive partnership contract . 
But you two are Sunagawa 's lapdogs , right ? 
- [ grunts ] - We 're not friends . 
So enough small talk . 
What do you want ? 
I want anything you 've got on Fable . 
I want the same , info on Fable . 
Then why don 't we share what we both know ? 
You tell me first . 
He 's had a contract with Maguro for many years . 
[ hitman ] He had to manually eject the shell after every shot with his gun . 
I didn 't get a good look at the gun itself , but the bullets were toys . 
Anyway , I want any info , no matter how trivial . 
What you got ? 
Well , a certain duo of odd-job men who also do killing ... got their butts kicked by a lone urban legend . 
[ Suzuki ] Pretty funny , huh ? 
[ gasps ] This is the gun you want a look at , right ? 
This is no toy . 
- This is a real Hush Puppy . - [ breathes shakily ] 
I know you 've got some kind of arrangement . 
Like , in this situation , forget about your partner and just shoot . 
Shoot ! 
[ Suzuki ] But that PPK .22 won 't go through this musclehead 's jacked body . 
So , what 'll you do ? 
- You don 't have much time to think . - [ breathing heavily ] 
There 's tons of adrenaline pumping through this musclehead 's body right now . 
He won 't feel pain for about five minutes . But once he slowly starts to feel the pain , then it 's too late . 
His lungs will collapse and his pulse will be gone slowly . 
[ Sunagawa 's hire groans ] [ hitman ] He just grazed me . 
- [ hitman grunts ] - [ body thuds ] [ Suzuki ] You should have done your homework . 
This can be fired on auto too . 
It 's not like that toy gun with a manual slide Fable had . 
It 's no wonder you got beat by a ghost like Fable . 
You need to be more attentive every day and study harder . 
[ breathes heavily ] Guess so . 
What are you looking at ? 
Uh , I was just passing by . 
[ Hina ] Then keep on going . 
[ Akira ] I was on my way to work , but ... 
Oh , I see . 
If you were there , then why didn 't you catch me before I fell ? 
Well , I thought it wouldn 't be right to interfere in your practice . 
This is physical therapy . It 's like practice though . 
[ Akira ] So , you want me to help ? 
No , thank you . 
Don 't touch me . 
What do you want ? 
Your legs don 't work , right ? 
Yeah , as you can clearly see . 
Is it funny ? 
[ Akira ] No , it 's not funny . 
By my estimation , at that rate , though it may take time , you 'll be able to walk again . 
- [ Akira ] I 'll come watch again . - [ gasps ] 
I don 't want you to come . 
I pass by here on my way to work . 
Like I said , then just keep on going . 
The bodies ? 
I got rid of them fast . 
You 'll run a hostess club here , right ? 
I 've cleaned everything up perfectly . 
I 've promised Suzuki I 'll destroy this video . 
I 'm surprised that Suzuki guy strolled in here all on his own . 
As someone in that line of work , he has an interest in Fable . 
After all I went through to get those underworld types together , but we didn 't get any new info . 
But one good thing came out of it . 
What 's that ? 
Those two hopeless morons died , and for free . 
You do understand that in our world , the failure of others is more important than our own success , right ? 
Yeah , I get it . 
I won 't go hunting Fable and turn them against me . 
Once I become the boss or captain , they 'll come to me , right ? 
I 'd be honored to work with a legendary assassin organization . 
Morning , Suzuki . 
Did Sunagawa still have any hair ? 
[ Suzuki ] Don 't know . 
I didn 't see Sunagawa . 
Guess that makes sense . 
Sunagawa 's no fool . 
Did you learn anything about Fable ? 
No . Those two I met didn 't know much . 
Does this Fable really even exist ? 
- It 's no more than an urban legend to me . 
- [ keyboard keys clacking ] We all love a good mystery , huh ? 
Anyway , don 't rush it . 
That 's when mistakes happen . 
[ Suzuki gulps ] Got it . 
As for that duo , they ticked me off , so I eliminated them . 
[ Utsubo ] Good exercise , huh ? 
Not in the least . 
Didn 't even take three minutes . 
Shorter than a boxing round . 
Me and Isaki are going out later . 
You 've done your work , so take it easy . 
Where you going ? 
- [ Utsubo ] To work on that next chicken . - [ keyboard key clacks ] 
MIKI KAWAMURA Adventure Adrift 
[ Suzuki ] That gloomy stalker , huh ? 
I 'll be leaving now . 
[ Misaki 's boss ] See you . 
Oh , wait , Sato . 
Yes ? 
You know those pictures you drew for that animal event for kids ? 
I ran into the person who ran that event . 
He loved the pictures and said they were heartwarming . 
My pictures ? 
You had me draw those , Misaki , so thank you . 
No problem . You 're welcome . 
I have some new pictures . 
[ Akira ] I was up all night drawing them . 
New pictures ? 
[ ♪ comical music playing ] [ Akira ] Shozo Hamanoya and Jackal Tomioka . 
[ Misaki in shaky voice ] I know him . 
[ Misaki 's boss in shaky voice ] You were up ... all night ? 
I drew picture after picture , for about five hours . 
[ Misaki ] Five hours ... ? 
[ Misaki 's boss splutters ] That 's enough . 
Don 't say any more . Before I knew it , it was morning . 
- [ Akira ] It was morning ... It was morning ... 
- [ stifled chuckles ] [ Misaki 's boss chuckles quietly ] Morning ... ? 
I also drew one of you , Misaki . 
What ? 
You don 't need to draw any more of me . 
[ Akira ] Here . 
You cut your hair , so I wanted to draw you . 
[ Misaki ] Don 't I look awful thick ? 
- [ Misaki 's boss chuckling quietly ] - Prez , have a look . 
[ Misaki 's boss ] Impossible . 
I can 't stop laughing . 
Can I have this ? 
This is the kind of picture I wanted . 
Sure . 
I drew that in 10 minutes . 
[ Misaki ] You didn 't need to tell me that . 
[ Kainuma ] Damn that weirdo , Sato . And what 's with Misaki too ? 
How can she be so happy over that lame drawing ? 
[ angry grunt ] He 's just a wuss who cries when he gets a nosebleed from some hoodlums . 
I did Kenpo for three months when I was 10 . 
I 'll beat the snot out of him . 
I even did Judo for two months . And I did Kendo for a whole month too . But even if I did beat him up , he knows I planted those hidden cameras . 
Darn that coward . 
I 'll hide my face with a mask , hat , and sunglasses . 
I 'll do it like a random beating and make it so he can 't come to work . 
[ anchor ] The city of Taihei is considering banning baseball and soccer from parks and open spaces - for the safety of children . 
[ TV turns off ] Aren 't you doing physical therapy today ? 
Don 't ignore me . 
We 're a team , right ? 
[ Hina ] There was a weird guy in the park . 
He creeped me out , so I 'll do it at a different time . 
A weird guy ? 
What 's he like ? Was he suspicious ? 
[ Hina ] No . He was an ordinary guy . 
As your big brother , you want me to scare him off ? 
[ Hina sighs ] No . He 's no big deal anyway . 
Don 't think of him like that . 
He can still be a threat to a girl in a wheelchair . 
[ sighs ] I 'm not that weak . 
[ Suzuki ] I know , but I can 't let this slide . 
It 's also my job to protect you . 
Just tell me what he looked like . 
The sun 's gone down and it 's getting cold . 
You waiting for someone , mister ? 
[ Akira ] Mm ... Maybe for that girl in the wheelchair ? 
Uh , yeah . 
You admitted that easily . 
Are you dumb or just honest ? 
That girl is my little sister . 
I came because she said there was a weird guy here . 
I 'm the weird guy ? 
She 's always trying so hard , I wanted to cheer her on . 
Does that make a guy weird ? 
You bet it does . You 're not even family . 
Or are you a doctor or something ? 
No . But I know quite a bit about the human body . 
Anyway , you 've frightened my sister . 
Stay away from her . 
[ Suzuki ] We just moved here , so don 't frighten her . 
Did I frighten her ? 
Don 't get near my sister , you perv . 
A perv , huh ? 
Why ? 
Good evening . 
Do you live in this building ? 
Huh ? 
Uh , yes . 
There 've been reports of bugs and hidden cameras in this building . 
[ Misaki ] A detective agency ? 
[ Utsubo ] We 're performing free inspections using a simple detector . 
It won 't take long . 
How about it ? 
[ Misaki ] No , it 's okay . 
There 's nothing in my place . 
Women who live alone are the most likely targets . 
If something bad happens , it 'll be too late . 
[ Utsubo ] It 's important to be cautious if you want to live in peace . 
Sorry , it 's such a mess . 
Not at all . 
It 's quite tidy . 
Can I call my workplace to let them know I 'll be late ? 
[ Utsubo ] Go ahead . 
We 'll get this done as quick as we can . 
If we don 't , besides a free inspection , I get the feeling you 'll make me pay your lost wages too . 
[ Misaki ] What ? 
You 'd pay for that ? 
[ Utsubo ] I 'd rather not . 
[ Misaki ] Uh , I 'll go outside and call . 
[ door opens , closes ] She is pretty . But she 's not very cautious . 
With her at his workplace , it 's no wonder Kainuma fell for her . 
She 's way out of Kainuma 's league . 
Kainuma had a key to this place , which means there are hidden cameras here . 
[ Utsubo ] Start searching from the back corners . 
This thing 's so cheap . 
You sure it 'll work ? 
No problem . 
I 'm sure Kainuma 's hidden cameras are cheap too . 
[ Yoko ] Hey . 
Lately , you 're always coming over right around dinner time . 
That 's because I get off work around this time . 
Oden today ? 
That 's right . 
Want some ? 
Does that Hinako Saba have an older brother ? 
[ Yoko ] What do you want to know that for ? 
From what I found out , she 's an only child . 
Figures . 
How 'd you get hurt ? 
[ Akira ] This ? 
The guy who called himself Saba 's brother kicked me . 
[ Yoko ] Huh ? You couldn 't block it ? 
I didn 't block it . 
Don 't underestimate a pro . 
[ Yoko ] Why would he kick you ? What did you do ? 
It 's probably because I talked to Hinako Saba . 
Even though he 's not her brother ? Who is this guy ? 
[ Akira ] I 'm not sure . But the way he kicked , he 's no ordinary martial artist . 
It was more like my style . 
The smell , I can tell ... 
You mean , he 's ... 
Never mind that . 
Is the oden ready ? 
It smells good . 
You mean the smell of this ? 
[ Yoko ] Quit changing the subject so quickly . 
You 're so confusing . 
[ detector beeping ] Uh , would you like some tea ? 
Sure , could we have some tea ? 
[ Misaki ] Oh , okay . 
- Hey . 
Sorry I don 't have a serving tray . 
No problem . 
Thank you . 
Your living room is clean . 
Lastly , we 'll check the toilet and bathroom . 
- Do you want to watch ? 
[ Misaki ] No , it 's okay . 
I 'll take the toilet . 
We 'll be finished soon . 
Now you can rest easy . 
[ chuckles ] Look at this . 
The peeping video you got earlier ? 
This is what happens with a human presence detection system . 
He 's such a dunce , it 's almost embarrassing . 
[ Isaki ] It 's like he left evidence so people would know that it was him who did it . 
For being so timid , he sure isn 't very careful . 
- [ keyboard keys clacking ] - [ Utsubo ] We 've got this evidence plus the hidden cameras we installed today . 
- Wow ! - [ Utsubo ] This kind of shameless stuff gets a better reaction and brings more money . 
Hina . Get in here . 
[ Utsubo ] Find a two-bedroom apartment near here . 
- We 'll rent it within a week . 
- Okay . And get some business cards designed . 
[ Hina ] Okay . 
I think there 's a printer near here that does that kind of thing . 
I 'm pretty sure it 's called ... Octopus . 
[ Hina ] Okay .
