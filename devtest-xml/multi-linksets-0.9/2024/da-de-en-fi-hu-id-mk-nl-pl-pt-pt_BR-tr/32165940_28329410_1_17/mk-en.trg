[ voice-over ] Even good medicine , when taken too much , becomes poisonous . 
[ official ] I even saw it on the news that all the swings in parks in Taihei will be replaced with safe swings . 
Yes . The plan is to finish by the end of the year . 
[ official ] You are so dependable , Mr. Utsubo . 
And I 'm working with the city to get a safety rail around the pond . 
Goodness ! Just like I heard , you 're a fast worker . 
You 're quite popular at the women 's club . 
Hina , bring me the documents . 
Here you are . 
Those are records of the drownings and injuries from the last 20 years . 
Dear me ! 
There 's been this many in the last 20 years ? 
Children are this country 's treasure . 
It is the duty of us adults to remove the stones that might trip them up so they can walk safely . 
[ Utsubo ] I want to protect children from everything that might harm their development , like porn and discriminatory language . 
That is my way of thinking . 
The Fable 
Rei Utsubo 
Taihei Detective Agency 
Mr. Utsubo , this stuff is totally legit . 
What 's shady about it ? 
[ Utsubo ] All of it . 
We 're a completely shady company . 
So everything you said before was a lie ? 
No , I meant it . 
It 's what I believe deep in my heart . 
Huh ? I don 't get you . 
Anyway , I could never do this kind of work . [ associate ] I 'm good at intimidating and kidnapping people though . 
Yeah , you and me both are misfits who could never even become proper yakuza . 
[ Utsubo ] Hang around tonight too . 
You can decide whether to work with us or not later . 
[ Utsubo ] " Monster parents . " That 's a great phrase . 
When I first heard it , it had me trembling . 
It 's so fitting . 
Why 's that ? 
It 's an amazing way to describe the opposite of " momma 's boy . " 
[ Utsubo ] Raise it up . 
Nice ! 
I love this kind of thing . 
So , who 's this guy ? 
A new type of person created from monster parents . 
[ Utsubo ] I love you , my boy . 
Now just calm down . 
You see , thanks to being raised by an incredibly overprotective mother , he has become a magnificent example of someone who is ignorant of the world . 
Hey , someone 's been spending all of mommy and daddy 's fabulous wealth . 
Cars , vacations , beauty treatments , and even hair removal . 
My , my . Quite the lavish life , eh ? 
How much are you going to get from intimidating him ? 
I 've already gotten it . About 10 million . 
[ Utsubo ] Now , this guy 's going to escape to Southeast Asia . 
- The story is that he 's taking a journey of " self-exploration " along with the 10 million in cash . 
His monster mother thinks her son is figuring out his identity . 
She must be quite happy . But she 'll be waiting forever for her son who 's never coming back . 
[ Utsubo ] Don 't you worry ! 
I hate gruesome sights too . 
[ associate ] Eh ? Go ahead . 
I think he 's trying to say something . 
Probably begging for his life . 
[ Utsubo ] It 's nothing that interests me . 
Overprotectiveness is great . 
It creates the best suckers . 
Children who fall on level paths . They don 't know dangerous games or what competition is . 
They have no immunity to getting hurt or having things not go their way . 
Why don 't we make more of children like that ? 
[ Utsubo ] For villains like us . 
- [ Jackal ] Please , Ai . I 'm begging you ! 
- [ ♪ dramatic mellow music playing ] 
[ Ai ] Yu-chan ! 
Just one time ! 
Just one shag ! 
Or even just the tip ! Please ! 
I 'm begging you ! 
[ Akira ] He 's so desperate . 
How passionate . 
So , this is love , huh ? Love ... [ children laughing ] [ child ] What 'll we play next ? 
Children are so sweet and innocent . 
Yeah , they 're cute while they 're baby chicks . 
I understand now why you told me to wear a suit . 
You know what they say about a skilled hawk . It hides its talons perfectly . 
[ Utsubo ] We promote whatever the current trends are to protect kids . 
I love people who complain like crazy about TV and magazines breaking broadcast codes and stuff . 
- [ child giggles ] - [ gasps ] Wait ! 
We work with those magnificent whiners and monster parents to put the children on the merry-go-round . 
Their beds are always germ-free , neat , and safe . 
Their parents will always protect them . 
So , the future is always bright , right ? 
We 'll keep them on the merry-go-round . 
We can 't let them become aware of reality . 
And we gobble them up once they 've become full-grown chickens , huh ? 
Isaki , I came up with this method 15 years ago . 
[ Utsubo ] In the past , people always said , 
" Send your sweet child on a journey , " or " Drop them into an abyss . " 
They raised kids differently then . 
The historian Trevelyan once said , " Education has produced a vast population able to read , but unable to distinguish what is worth reading . " 
The more children there are who can 't choose what to read , and who can 't use smarts and innovation , then the better business is for me . 
We 've got a new team member starting today . 
My name 's Isaki . 
Nice to meet you . 
[ Utsubo ] That 's Hiroshi Suzuki . 
That 's Hinako Saba . 
You were driving that excavator , weren 't you ? 
Listen , Isaki . 
Don 't go prying . 
Everyone 's got their secrets . However , the four of us here will be working together . 
Teamwork is important . 
For a big job , a team of four is best . 
With too many , quarrels are more likely . And with too few , there 's not enough to do the work . 
[ Utsubo ] The Beatles . U2 . 
KISS . Queen . 
The Sex ... 
What is it again ? 
The Sex Pistols . 
Bands that gave us famous songs all had four members . 
Anyway , it 's what I like . 
Let 's drink to the chickens who can 't use smarts and innovation . 
Cheers . 
Isaki . [ Utsubo ] You 'll be sharing a room with Suzuki . 
You sleep on the top bunk . 
The room in the back is mine . 
[ Utsubo ] The room to the right of the living room is Hina 's . 
If you make noise , I 'll kick you from below . 
I just want you guys to get along . 
We 're all partners , after all . 
You 've got work , right ? 
Go get it done . 
Can we trust that guy ? 
Isaki used to be a member of the Maguro Group . 
Trust is important , but being useful is more important . 
If he gets in the way , we 'll get rid of him . 
Never mind that . 
I heard Maguro 's Sunagawa had his business messed with . 
I heard an odd rumor . 
You mean , about what hair tonic he 's using ? 
[ Utsubo ] It 's a little late for him , don 't you think ? 
Do you know a hitman named Fable ? 
- [ ♪ uneasy music playing ] - That 's just an underworld urban legend . 
[ Utsubo ] What would you do if you found out he was real ? 
He apparently had a gun like yours . 
A gun with a silencer used for assassinations ... and a manual ejector . 
A Hush Puppy , huh ? 
An imitation that 's similar to it . 
Either way , if it looks like he 'll be trouble , we 'll look into both Fable and Maguro . 
[ Utsubo ] Those who aren 't prepared are always in a panic . 
If I were fighting Dracula , I 'd have a crucifix and garlic , and set up a plan to bathe him in sunlight . 
Octopus 
I finished the delivery . 
[ Misaki 's boss ] Great . 
You can leave for the day , Sato . 
[ Akira ] Okay . 
[ Misaki ] Good night . 
[ Akira ] See you later . 
[ Misaki ] This is so annoying . This is so darn annoying . 
He could have said something . 
About what ? 
What for ? 
[ Misaki ] He 's just so darn callous . 
[ singing ] ♪ You feel your shoulders ... ♪ [ birds squawking ] 
The girl from that time ... 
[ Isaki ] Anyway , cheers . 
It 's been two years , huh ? 
Yeah . 
I couldn 't stick around in Taihei . 
How come you couldn 't ? 
It 's not like you got expelled or cut off . 
I 'm glad to hear you say that , but the other members don 't look at it that way . 
No sooner did our beef with Sameken start three years ago , than I got arrested for some totally unrelated fight . 
And then I got released on bail the moment the beef with them ended . 
So , of course everyone thought I ran away . 
Enough already . 
- You 're ruining our get-together . - [ sighs ] 
Mama . [ Mama ] Sure . 
How are things with you , Kuro ? 
I heard you 're moving up in Maguro . 
- Maybe so , but it 's a small group . 
Nothing 's really changed . 
[ Isaki ] How 's Takahashi doing ? 
[ Kuro ] Still a plebe . 
[ Isaki ] A plebe , huh ? [ laughs ] 
What about Mr. Sunagawa ? 
Is he getting along with Mr. Ebihara ? 
You digging for info ? 
[ Isaki ] Don 't be silly . 
It 's been a while , so I 'm just wondering how they 're doing . 
Asking about Mr. Sunagawa and Mr. Ebihara ... That 's not the kind of question an ex-member should ask over drinks . 
[ Isaki ] I told you , I 'm not ... 
You were a yakuza once , so you should know better . 
[ Isaki ] Fine . I get it . Where are you going ? [ Kuro ] The can . 
You always show up when I 'm about to have dinner . 
[ Akira ] There 's something I want you to look into . 
I want to see the files on a murder that happened in Tokyo four years ago in June . 
Do it yourself . 
I have work . 
That 's so uncool ! 
Are you saying I 've got nothing better to do ? 
Well , it 's true , right ? 
You better watch out . 
[ Yoko ] It ticks people off when you talk that way . 
Why do you want to know about that murder ? 
Don 't you go causing trouble . 
There 's something bothering me . 
I 've told you this a hundred times . 
We 're here so we can live ordinary lives . 
No causing fights or trouble . [ Yoko ] And don 't even think about killing anyone . 
What 's wrong ? 
You going to eat ? 
You want me to blow on it ? 
[ Akira ] No , never mind . 
- You added too much salt . - Eh ? - Good night . - Hey ! 
- [ Yoko ] What 's his problem ? - [ door closes ] 
That 's salty ! 
[ Hina ] It 's that time of the month for me . 
Think I care ? 
I like blood . 
I 'm back ... 
Hurry up and shut the door , you twit . 
- Oh , right . - [ door closes ] 
Isaki , you married ? Huh ? What 's that all about ? 
No way . 
What about you , Mr. Suzuki ? 
[ chuckles ] You must be kidding . 
You know anyone that marriage brought happiness to ? 
[ Isaki ] Hold on here . 
There 's no way you 're older than me . 
Is that so ? 
How old do I look ? [ Isaki chuckles ] What is this ? A hostess club ? 
- [ door opens ] - Suzuki 's almost 40 . 
Mr. Utsubo ... What ? 
40 ? 
[ Suzuki ] Why did you go and tell him ? 
Make me a drink . 
You got plastic surgery ? 
Quit flapping your lips , you brat . 
Isaki , what did you learn about the Maguro Group ? 
Well , sorry ... 
- Don 't sweat it . - [ liquid sloshing ] 
I 'm not in a huge hurry to get info on Maguro . 
This here is first . 
A new chicken ? [ Utsubo ] Yeah . 
I 've had my eye on him since he was around 10 . 
He 's a little over 20 about now . 
I want you two to check him out . 
His family 's assets . His work . His friends . His sexual taste . 
The more info , the better . 
[ Utsubo ] Get close to him and find dirt on him . 
Gain his trust then exploit his weakness . 
Put the weak at ease , then steal everything from them . 
That 's the way the FBI used to do it . 
Let 's see here ... 
Etsuji Kainuma , age 23 . 
Memorize everything written there . 
And imprint his face in your memory . 
[ Utsubo ] Shred it when you 're done . 
Not just that info , but his life too . 
Good morning . [ Misaki 's boss ] Oh , Sato . 
Come here . [ Akira ] Yes ? 
You know , Misaki 's been in a bad mood . 
You two had a fight or something ? 
[ Akira ] A fight ? No , not at all . 
Can you think of anything you did that might have upset her ? 
Not at all . 
[ sighs ] Is that so ? [ Akira ] Yeah . Anyway , when Misaki comes , give her some kind of compliment . She said she was going to the beauty salon yesterday . Okay . 
[ Misaki 's boss ] When Misaki 's in a bad mood , it 's hard for me to get my job done . 
[ Misaki ] Good morning . - [ door closes ] - [ Misaki 's boss ] She 's here . 
- Good morning , Prez . - [ Misaki 's boss ] Morning . Good morning . 
Go on , compliment her . 
That sure is red . Huh ? 
- Oh , you mean my top ? - [ ♪ comical music playing ] 
Not that ! 
Your skirt sure is white . [ Misaki ] Huh ? So , what about it ? No ! Her hair . Her hair . 
And your hair is really black . 
- Huh ? - [ Misaki 's boss gasps ] Yes , that 's the color of my hair . What 's your problem , Sato ? 
What the heck is wrong with you ? 
Oh , right . That 's the same coloring as the Brazilian coral snake . 
- [ Misaki ] Snake ? - [ awkward chuckle ] 
- It 's a venomous ... - Enough . Go make a delivery . 
[ Misaki ] A venomous snake ? 
It 's a very beautiful snake ... Enough . Enough . 
- [ door opens ] - [ Kainuma ] Good morning . 
Huh ? Did you get a new hairdo , Misaki ? 
Huh ? Uh , yes , actually . 
I 've got work at a bar starting again tonight . 
Really ? 
[ Kainuma ] Guess you 'll be busy again . 
Will you be working late ? - Have a conversation like that . - [ Akira ] Mm ... Yeah , like until 3 a.m. or something . Really ? 3 a.m. , huh ? 
[ Kainuma ] Then tonight , I can get back the memory card . 
At last , I can get into her place . 
In fact , if I wanted to , I could lie in wait for her . 
I could knock her out and bang her . 
I should be able to get away with it . 
Okay , let 's call it quits for today . I 'm exhausted . 
A venomous snake , huh ? 
Maybe I 'll change clothes . 
Misaki , he didn 't intend to be mean by what he said . 
He was complimenting you in his own way . 
I understand , but ... It 's just kind of ... 
Later , Sato told me your hair looks cute short . [ Misaki 's boss ] That 's a lie . 
[ Misaki gasps ] He did ? 
Then he noticed . 
Of course he did . 
[ Misaki 's boss ] That 'll be my story . 
Then I 'll go to my next job dressed like this . [ Misaki 's boss ] Cheer up ! 
Yeah , go on . [ Misaki 's boss ] Misaki , you look good no matter what you wear or what your hairdo is . 
[ Misaki chuckles ] You 're being too flattering , Prez . 
- [ Misaki 's boss ] I 'm serious . - [ Misaki 's boss and Misaki chuckle ] Okay , see you later . Good night . [ Misaki 's boss ] Okay . 
- [ Kainuma ] Bye , Misaki . - [ door opens ] - Dang , I 'm exhausted . - [ door closes ] 
Darn that Sato . [ Kainuma ] That 's right . Everything is Sato 's fault . 
I was content with just spying , but then he interfered . 
[ sighs ] Sato 's on a delivery and will go straight home . 
You want to go for a drink , Kai ? No . I 've got something to do tonight . 
Sorry , Prez . Uh ... There 's no need to apologize . 
I 'll be going now . 
- [ Kainuma ] Yeah , I 'm pretty ticked off . - [ ♪ tense ominous music playing ] 
It 's Sato ... It 's society ... It 's the whole world 's fault . 
I 'm going to do just what I want to do .
