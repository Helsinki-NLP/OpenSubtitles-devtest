The Fable 
Mountaineer Man 
- [ Akira ] This one 's a little small . 
- [ hisses ] Be careful ! 
That 's a venomous snake . 
The knife handle ... 
[ Kuro ] Whoa ! All that was inside ? 
[ Akira ] That 's why it 's not a very strong knife construction . But it does have a useful design . 
[ Kuro ] You 're harvesting its poison ? 
What 'll you do with it ? 
I 'll use this poison on the bear . 
[ exclaims ] How will you do that , Nii-san ? 
Won 't the poison kill the bear ? 
This much won 't kill a bear . It 's too little . 
Just some pain and swelling for a few days . 
[ Akira ] They 're not weak like humans . Wow . 
Is that right ? 
For the bear 's sake , it has to be taught that messing with humans will only cause it pain . 
- [ knife clinks ] - [ grunts ] [ Kuro ] Another snake dissection ... The third one . 
- At last , I think I 'm used to it . - [ squelching ] But part of me still isn 't . 
However , I do know that snake meat is delicious . And viper ... [ gulps ] ... is especially tasty ! 
[ sighs ] [ Yoko ] I was wearing a short skirt last time too . 
Kawai 's type likes whatever the fad is . 
They like designer goods and are concerned about looks . 
[ sighs ] I want Kawai to like me even more . 
I want to send his heart fluttering and make him all mine . And I want to drink with him and watch him crawl because he can 't walk . 
I want to talk with you when you 're so drunk that you can 't form words . 
I want to hear you speak when I can 't understand what you 're saying . 
Stare at me with glazed and sleepy eyes . 
You see ... I can 't help it . 
I 've got nothing to do . 
- [ Kuro ] It 's getting dark . 
- [ bird cawing ] [ Akira ] Yeah . 
- [ crunches ] - [ grunts ] I wonder if the bear will show up . 
[ Akira ] Well , it 's best if it doesn 't show up . But it 's better ... if we prepare for how to deal with it if it does show up . 
- [ ♪ comical music playing ] - [ Kuro ] I 'm getting a total boner . Is this because ... I ate viper meat ? 
[ Akira ] People believe that bears are nocturnal , but they are also ... 
[ Kuro ] Nii-san 's telling me about bears , but I 'm here with a woodie . 
I 'm sorry , Nii-san . You 're preparing to fight a bear , but I 'm ... I 've got a massive woodie ! 
- [ door bell jingling ] - [ door closes ] - It 's been a while , bartender . 
- [ bartender ] Kawai . 
You 're early today . 
The first , in fact . 
Yeah , well ... Today is game day . 
Game day ? 
I 'm meeting that girl . 
You know , the one I talked to the other day here , Yoko . 
Oh ... her . 
[ Yuki ] She 's top-class , being from Tokyo and all . 
Yeah , she is cute ... [ awkward chuckle ] 
I 'll get her to a hotel tonight and get it on with her . 
So , come on , bartender , back me up . 
Oh , I see ... 
That girl , huh ? 
I won 't make you look bad . 
In fact , I could date a girl like that for quite a while . 
[ awkward grunt ] Mm ... How come I 'm so darn alpha ? 
Such a burden . 
[ bartender ] Kawai . 
Lots of luck . 
[ Akira ] The way a bear attacks is pretty simple . 
It tackles you and overwhelms you with its strength . 
It swings its arms using its claws as weapons and ... 
- What 's wrong ? 
- Well , uh ... 
[ Kuro ] We 'll be facing off against a bear , but that viper gave me a raging hard-on . 
I could never say that ! 
[ Kuro ] Nii-san , aren 't you afraid of bears ? 
Bears ? Why ? Are you afraid of them ? 
Yeah ! Bears are bad news . 
They could kill you . 
[ Kuro ] But I 've got a woodie . 
Don 't worry . 
There 's one thing that all bears don 't understand . 
Humans are smarter than them . 
I understand that logic . But in a fight , they 've got the advantage in power , weight , and skill . Just relax . If you 're nervous , you 'll get stiff . 
[ Kuro ] I know . A part of me is very stiff . 
[ Akira ] The scent of an animal . 
- I think it 's here . 
Can 't we use the campfire ? 
Don 't animals hate fire ? 
[ Akira ] Unfortunately , a flame the size of a campfire won 't scare a bear . 
Why are you crouched over ? 
[ Kuro ] Well , I , uh ... 
Anyone who eats that much viper gets like that . 
[ Akira ] Don 't worry about it . 
[ Kuro ] I 'm sorry ! 
[ Kuro ] He could totally tell ! 
Do just what I tell you . 
We 'll teach it to fear humans in six seconds . 
Okay ! 
Yoko , over here . 
Okay . 
[ bartender ] I can sense it ... 
Tonight is going to be a wild one . 
Did you wait long ? 
[ Yuki ] I just got here . 
[ bartender ] Liar ! 
You 've been scheming here for a whole hour . 
Anyway ... A man and a woman , deceiving one another , in a night of flirtatious drinking . 
Stepping into the ring tonight at Bar Buffalo are these two . 
Neither of them are ordinary customers . 
This is Yuki Kawai , the Muhammad Ali of Buffalo . 
He is by far the number-one heartbreaker at this bar . 
His footwork when hitting on women is lighter than a butterfly 's . 
I 've seen countless women cry over him at this bar . 
He floats like a butterfly from woman to woman , penetrating each with his " stinger . " 
In the other corner is the mysterious beauty Yoko , who recently moved here . 
She is one of the hottest-looking women to have ever visited Buffalo . But she has an allure that goes beyond just looks . And she uses it to grip men 's hearts like a vise . 
I love drinking , but I can 't hold my liquor . 
So I 'm sorry if I get drunk and do or say weird things tonight . 
I 'm afraid if I don 't tell you that ahead of time ... [ soft moan ] Don 't worry . 
[ bartender ] There it is ! 
She 's drawn first blood . Okay , bartender . The usual . 
The usual ? 
Bartender , can you make a vodka-based sweet but strong drink ? 
Oh , a lady-killer cocktail , eh ? 
When I ask for " the usual , " give us that . And make mine light on the vodka . 
The usual . 
Got it . [ bartender ] Very well . Since I promised , I 'll serve it . 
That 's right . 
You both get the same amount of vodka . 
[ Yoko ] This is delicious . 
[ giggles ] [ bartender ] The starting bell has rung in Kawai vs. Yoko . 
It 's about to begin . 
Keep on your guard . 
[ Yoko ] Yuki Kawai . 
He looks about 24 or 25 . 
A high-end watch , a designer shirt , faintly sweet cologne , snowboarding , and jet skiing . 
A shallow warrior whose whole life is dedicated to getting laid . 
[ inhales sharply ] What a splendid toy . 
What 's the matter ? 
When you stare like that , it makes me blush . 
[ soft gasp ] I 'm not staring . 
[ Yuki ] Oh , Yoko . I totally get why you 're entranced by me . 
The way you get flustered is just so cute . 
Are you just as shy when in bed ? 
Do you like having the lights off ? 
Sorry , but I always keep the lights on , even if the power is out . 
I want you under the lights so I can imprint you on my mind . 
After you get drunk tonight , Yoko , we 're going to a love hotel . 
Oh , don 't stare like that . 
You 're making me blush . 
This is payback for earlier . 
- [ Yoko ] Eh ! Oh , you . 
- [ Yuki chuckles ] [ bartender ] These two are truly flirt masters . 
They start with some jabs to measure each other up . 
The truth is , I wanted to call you even sooner . But my brother hasn 't been well . 
You mean your weak and sickly brother you told me about before ? 
Yes . 
[ inhales sharply ] ... is your brother all right ? 
Yes . 
Yesterday , he went to the mountains where the air is better . 
Oh , I 've heard about those convalescent homes . 
That 's right . 
It 's given me a little break too . 
I couldn 't help wanting to get a little drunk tonight . 
Ah , don 't you worry ! Get drunk . 
I 'll see you home . 
[ Yoko chuckles ] [ Yoko ] Just the part about him going to the mountains is true . 
[ Kuro ] No sight of that bear . 
Maybe it went somewhere else . 
[ Akira ] No . It 's even closer than before . 
Can 't you smell the animal scent ? 
[ sniffs ] No . 
[ sniffing ] I don 't smell it at all . 
[ sniffing continues ] Yuki , do you like going to the mountains and doing outdoor stuff ? 
I love going camping . 
I 've even got a barbecue set . And I 've always got a tent and sleeping bag at the ready . 
The outdoors is just the place for a man to get in touch with his true nature . 
[ Yoko ] Really ? 
I didn 't expect you to like the outdoors . 
How come ? 
I 'm a guy who absolutely loves barbecuing . 
Meat grilled outdoors is really delicious , isn 't it ? 
- And it 's nice with a little lemon . - [ bartender exclaims ] 
A little lemon is nice . 
Especially with salted beef tongue . 
I 've always had a thing for lemons . 
I put it on everything . 
I 've loved lemons since I was a girl . 
I was always wanting lemons . 
Lemons ? 
[ bartender ] This talk about lemons is a ruse . 
The Drunk Queen 's ruthless attack is about to begin . 
Say , bartender . Do you have a drink that goes with lemon ? 
[ Yoko ] Wait ! Is there really a drink that goes with lemon ? 
- [ bartender grunts ] - [ Yoko ] Lemons , got it ? Lemons . You 're a pro , right ? A bartending pro , right ? 
[ bartender ] Leave this to me . 
I 'm a pro . If you like lemons that much , you should try tequila . 
Lemon and tequila is an unbeatable combo . 
Oh , right . You bite a lemon with it . 
[ Yoko ] You bite a lemon ? 
How do you do it ? 
Can we have it together ? 
Two tequilas coming up . 
First , take a shot of tequila . 
[ gulps ] - Then bite the lemon wedge . 
- [ squirts ] You can have the lemon first too . Whichever is easier . 
Enjoy the tequila 's flavor and the sourness of the lemon . 
I 'm getting all excited now . 
Watch me , okay ? 
[ Yoko exclaims pleasantly ] [ gasps ] This is so delicious . 
Another tequila , bartender . 
Oh , drink with me , Yuki . 
Make that two . 
[ bartender ] Coming right up . 
[ bartender ] You 've got it all wrong , Kawai . You 're the one getting set up . 
Whoever drowns in tequila first loses . 
The smell is getting stronger . 
It 's close . 
S-Seriously ? 
- [ bear growls ] - [ Kuro screams ] You bad boy . 
[ whimpers ] Nii-san ! 
- [ squelches ] - [ Akira ] Nice . 
- [ bear groans ] - Now that bear will be afraid of humans . 
It 'll be in agony from that viper poison for a while . 
This will teach it - that humans are big trouble . 
- [ panting ] [ Akira ] It 'll get cold tonight . 
How about we make some pine tea ? 
[ Kuro ] What ? This is how he acts after fighting off a bear ? 
Nii-san is totally amazing ! 
Yay ! 
Our 20th shot of tequila ! 
Y-Yay ... [ ♪ upbeat music playing ] 
[ squirts ] [ soft groaning ] Yuki , are you okay ? 
Hold still now . 
This trick will sober you up . 
Don 't worry . 
These are just pistachios . 
[ laughs ] [ bartender ] The Drunk Queen Yoko is overwhelmingly victorious . 
Not only can she hold her liquor , her heart 's as tough as nails . 
You okay , Mr. Kawai ? 
[ coughs , babbles weakly ] [ Yoko ] I get it . 
That was , " Ptui . I 'm fine , Yoko . " 
- [ Yuki retches ] - Sounded like , " Peh Daiyocha . " Like a Korean actor 's name . 
With his face in the toilet , he says , " Peh Daiyocha . " 
After Takahashi 's " Wait for myee , " it 's another classic . " Peh Daiyocha . " 
Is Kawai all right ? 
- [ Yoko ] Things are just getting started . - [ clanks ] 
- [ gasps ] - [ thumps ] [ Yoko ] Here he comes . 
- Here comes Peh Daiyocha . - [ thumps ] 
How will he appear ? What kind of look will be on his face ? 
It feels like I 'm waiting for a concert to start ! 
- Come on , let 's see it , Peh Daiyocha . - [ clanks ] 
- [ grunting ] - There he is ! 
[ squeals excitedly ] He 's looking for something to grab onto ! 
- [ grunts , yelps ] - [ Yoko squeals ] It 's like he dove into a pool ! 
- [ bartender gasps ] - [ amused chuckle ] [ Yoko ] Come on , stand up . 
Stand up for me , Peh Daiyocha ! 
- [ Yuki grunts ] - [ ♪ dramatic menacing music playing ] Oh , I love it ! 
It 's like a scene from a horror flick . 
- [ Yuki chuckles awkwardly ] 
- Yes ! A zombie ! 
- Get a taxi ! - [ ♪ whimsical music sting ] 
No ! 
Get an ambulance ! 
- [ Yoko ] Get a taxi ! 
- No ! Get an ambulance ! 
[ Yuki ] What ? 
A taxi ? I 'm not letting you leave , Yoko . 
That 's because I swore to myself that I 'd bed you tonight . 
[ Yuki ] Tonight , me and you are getting it on ! 
- We 're going to bang all night long ! - [ Yuko gasps ] 
[ Yoko ] Amazing ! Absolutely amazing ! 
He 's saying out loud what he 's telling himself ! 
Such intensity ! 
The bloodstained man who declared we 'd bang all night is getting closer . 
- I love this horror movie feel ! - [ ♪ dramatic music playing ] 
This is so thrilling ! So incredibly thrilling ! 
My goodness ! Just look how desperate he is to bang me ! 
[ shouts ] Yoko ! 
Water ... 
Water ... [ awkward grunt , chuckle ] [ Yoko ] Drink this . 
- [ ♪ whimsical music sting ] - It 's water . 
- [ gulps ] - [ bartender ] That 's tequila ! 
- Frothing like a crab ? - No ! Alcohol poisoning ! 
[ Yuki farting ] - [ line ringing ] - It seems the crab 's insides are ... 
Stop ! Don 't you dare say it ! 
Hello ? 
I need an ambulance . 
Okay , I think I 'll be going . 
[ bartender ] Yes , that 's right . 
I think he 's got acute alcohol poisoning . And he 's ... uh ... he pooped in his pants . 
[ ♪ light music playing ] [ Yoko ] His pulse and breathing are fine . 
You 're getting way too worried . 
I think Kawai just drank too much . 
That 's 100 % for sure . 
[ Yoko ] Tomorrow , I 've got to pick up my sickly brother in the mountains . 
I 'm pretty busy , so I 'll call it a night . 
[ bartender ] What a battle . 
The Drunk Queen Yoko wins by a mile . 
A sensational KO victory . 
A crushing defeat for the generational playboy , Kawai . 
A man and a woman , deceiving one another , in a night of flirtatious drinking . 
[ Kuro ] Just like Nii-san kept saying , this definitely wasn 't camping . 
A lot happened , but last night was incredible . 
That bear scared me to death . 
Smarts and innovation , huh ? 
- [ ♪ calm music playing ] - What you learn in nature can usually be used in some way in the opposite world of the city . 
[ Kuro ] In the city , you can buy what you need . But it 's not that way here . 
It takes all your smarts to catch snakes , frogs , or even a single grasshopper . 
[ Akira ] Morning . 
That dagger spear I threw at the bear ... 
I looked for it but couldn 't find it . 
That 's okay ! Don 't worry about it . 
I feel kind of bad for the bear . 
I hope I didn 't injure the bear too badly . 
Nii-san , can I ask you a question ? 
[ Kuro ] Just one question . 
The tools you use in your work ... Are they all things you can buy just about anywhere ? 
[ Akira ] Yeah . 
Everything but my gun can be bought anywhere . 
If they don 't have what I need , I make it . 
I don 't use anything special . 
My targets will do anything to survive . 
So lots of unexpected things happen . 
Usually , things never go as planned . 
That 's exactly why I come here to get in the habit of using smarts and innovation . 
I 've still got a lot to learn though . 
I hope that someday , the only special thing I need is myself . 
[ Akira ] Okay , let 's make our way back down . 
Put out that fire . 
[ Kuro ] Yes , sir . 
- [ water rushing ] - There 's no way ! 
Come on . Jump . 
Okay ! 
Honeybees are most aggressive right now , before winter . 
Good thing they 're not hornets . 
- [ honeybees buzzing ] - [ Kuro ] My nose got stung ! 
Will I be okay ? 
Come on ! Run ! It 's just a little swollen . It 'll be fine . 
As expected of me . I 'm five minutes early . 
So , where are those boys ? 
[ Yoko exclaims ] There they are . 
My brother and ... 
Who 's that ? 
[ Yoko ] How was your trip in the mountains ? 
Was it useful ? 
No , it was normal . 
Nii-san , you fought a bear ! 
Seriously ? 
A bear ? 
Since I lost your dagger , you can have this . 
- What 's that ? 
- A Blackhawk knife . 
I bought it for going to the mountains , but I didn 't use it this time . 
[ surprised exclaim ] Seriously ? Can I really have it ? 
That 's the kind of knife I used to use . 
It 's the same kind I lost when I stabbed a bear in the eye with it . 
Isn 't that great , Kuro ? 
That 's like a souvenir . 
I 've heard humanity 's oldest tool is the knife . 
It 's more useful than a tie . 
[ Akira ] You can thrust , peel , break , cut , scrape , and tear with it . 
Thank you so much ! 
I 'll treasure it ! 
[ Yoko ] You know , you two guys stink . 
Open the window ! 
[ Akira ] We do ? 
[ Kuro ] Thank you so much !
