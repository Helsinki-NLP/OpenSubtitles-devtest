It 's just me , Kenny . 
Major ? Colonel Harding 's looking for you . [ sighs ] Yeah . 
- [ Lemmons ] You okay , Major ? 
[ Lemmons ] We 're all gonna miss Major Cleven , sir . 
Weather report . 
Supposed to clear up . Oh , good . 
Want a ride , Major ? Nah . I 'll be all right . 
You sure , sir ? 
Don 't worry , Kenny . I don 't even feel it . 
See ya in the morning . 
[ Crosby ] Bremen was the toughest mission of the war for me . 
It was the heaviest flak I 'd ever experienced . 
A shell fragment the size of a football crashed through the nose of our fort , nearly decapitating me and Douglass . 
Our left wing caught fire and we lost all electrical power , but somehow Ev Blakely got us back to England . 
I also saw Major Cleven 's plane take a direct hit and go down . 
From the day I joined the 100th , Buck Cleven was our leader . 
We thought he was invincible . 
If Gale Cleven couldn 't make it , who could ? 
Can we help you ? 
Yeah . You can start by getting the hell out of our racks . 
And where 's my locker , huh ? 
- Sorry , sir . I was told your airplane ... - Well , it didn 't . 
Get your gear and step outside , gentlemen . 
I 'll find you a new hut . 
Hey , uh , you didn 't , uh , ship my locker already , did ya ? 
No , sir . It 's still in the orderly hut . 
- [ exhales sharply ] - [ Blakely ] I need a drink . 
That 's a good idea . 
[ Blakely ] Come on . 
Now , Dougie ... [ grunts ] ... what the hell you got in your locker you 're so worried about ? 
[ chuckles ] I got more fucking rubbers than I can count . And I sure as hell don 't need my mom to count them , huh ? 
[ Crosby chuckles ] - Don 't worry , I 'll talk to her . - [ Douglass chuckles ] 
- [ jazz music playing ] - [ patrons chattering ] [ navigator ] Holy shit , it 's Blakely 's crew . 
Jesus , we thought you bought it . 
They reported four chutes out of your ship . 
I guess someone can 't count . No one bailed . 
Via and Yevich are in the hospital . 
We lost Saunders . 
Where 'd you land ? 
[ Douglass ] Some RAF field outside Ludham . 
- It was a hell of a hairy belly landing . 
- [ Blakely ] You can say that again . Two engines shot , whole fuselage full of holes . 
Some mechanic counted them . - How much was it , 1,200 ? - 1,200 . Stabilizer was totally shredded . Couldn 't get the wheels down . 
Don 't worry , the brakes still worked . Till we hit the runway . 
It was a goddamn miracle that this man , Everett Blakely , landed her at all . 
No , the miracle was Croz 's bearing . One degree off and we 're in the drink . 
- Pure luck . - Yeah , you do it too often for it to be luck . 
Then he managed to navigate us right smack into the only tree for miles , so ... Bull 's-eye . The guy 's a natural . The only tree in East Anglia , - he hits it . - [ Douglass ] Biggest field you 've ever ... - Harry Crosby ... - Straight in . ... greatest navigator in the 8th Air Force , right over there , ladies . All right , who 's drinking ? I 'm buying . Crank is too . 
- [ Cruikshank ] I am ? - [ Brady ] Yes , he is . Come on . - [ Cruikshank ] If you say so . - [ Blakely ] Beautiful . 
[ Douglass ] All right , man . - Bubbles ... how are you , buddy ? 
- Is it really you , Croz ? 
Jesus , why the hell didn 't you call ? 
[ stammers ] RAF base didn 't have a telephone . 
- [ stammers ] Lucky they had a truck . 
- Can 't believe this . 
You know , I-I wrote Jean . [ stammers ] You did ... You ... Sorry , you ... you what ? I wrote your wife a letter . We all thought you ... - But you didn 't send it , did you ? - No , no . Oh , thank God . 
Couldn 't think of anything nice to say , so ... [ chuckles ] You know , a few times I thought I was dead too , to tell you the truth . 
Yeah , well , you made it back . 
Just in time too . They 're , uh , starting to shake things up at operations . 
What , group navigator ? 
I 'm on the chopping block . Carter too . 
They 're gonna replace us just as soon as they can find the guys to replace us with . 
They won 't . 
- Here you go , Croz . 
- Thanks , Knifehead . 
- Hey , hey . To the 100th ! 
- I 've never heard that before . 
Never . - Really ? Croz , Harding wants to see you . 
[ soldier ] Hey , it 's Egan . What 's he doing back early ? 
[ breathes shakily ] Guess they made their decision . 
- Fill her up , Mike ? - [ Mike ] Sure thing . 
No use wondering , gentlemen . 
You can all do the math as to why I came back early . 
Jesus . Another mission . 
We 're flying every day now ? 
230830 , Brady . 30725 , give it to Cruikshank . 
- [ soldier 1 ] Uh , Major ? - Clift ! Do we have 230758 ? 
[ soldier 2 ] One important thing . I didn 't actually , I couldn 't understand what was ... 
Sorry , sir , but , uh , engineering aren 't gonna be able to get those two ships you asked about ready by wheels up . Can we get a picture of the MPI ? Well , uh , did you get the bomb load details to ordnance yet ? 
It 's all squared away . They have everything they need . 
- Hey , Croz . - Got one . So , we start with a duty officer . Homer . Crosby 's just been promoted to group navigator . 
- Welcome to the monkey house , Captain . 
- Thank you . Spence will have navigation field orders for you . 
Captain , you take it down to S-2 . Tell the clerk what you need . 
[ Bowman ] Goddamn it . 
[ officer ] Sorry . 
[ Bowman ] Get a cloth , will ya ? 
Jesus . That 's fine . 
[ knocking ] Keep up , Croz . - No harm done . - Thank you . 
So this is your office . 
You get your own jeep . It 's a perk of the job . Anything else you need , you ask Tripp . Right ? 
Good luck , Croz . 
- Uh , Major ? 
You sure I 'm the right man for this ? - No . 
Your primary target is Münster . 
Your aiming point and mean point of impact is the railroad marshaling yards . 
The target is just east of the city center . 
Be quiet . Listen up . 
[ Bowman ] So , accuracy on this mission is paramount . 
Intelligence reports that most of the housing in the adjacent neighborhoods are railroad workers . So , if they 're hit , then we 'll be hitting the men who keep the German railroads running . 
Lights . Colonel ? 
[ Harding ] Thank you , Red . 
95th is leading with us in the low , and the 390th in the high . 
Good news is it 's a short flight . Münster is pretty damn close . 
Bad news is we can only muster 17 ships ... [ murmuring ] ... a few of which weren 't even ours two days ago . [ soldiers murmuring ] Only 17 ships ? 
That 's the mission , boys : Disrupt industrial transportation in the Ruhr valley . Understood ? 
[ soldiers ] Yes , sir . 
[ Harding ] Good . Major Egan will be command pilot in Brady 's fort . 
We just flew two missions in two days . 
Aren 't they supposed to rotate the squadrons ? Let one have a mission off ? 
Who else they got ? 
[ Murphy ] It 's not right . It 's Sunday . 
[ Brady ] Yeah , and tomorrow is Monday . 
You saw how close that cathedral is to the MPI . 
We 're hitting it right when everyone 's coming out of mass . 
[ Brady ] And ? There 'll be a lot of people in that cathedral . Or in their houses . 
And not just railroad workers either . 
They 're all part of it . 
We 've never had a target this close to a city ... Ah , Jesus Christ , Crank . It 's a war . 
Here to drop bombs . 
On women and kids ? 
Well , this won 't end till we hit ' em where it hurts . 
Better now before every fucking guy we 've ever shared a bunk with is either dead or MIA . 
None of the people we 're gonna bomb today shot down Buck . 
You flying today or not ? 
" Yes , sir . " 
Yes , sir . 
You look like shit . 
Feel like it . Gimme that . 
Go to bed , why don 't you ? 
Well , I wanted to make sure all the navigators have what they need . 
Well , I 'd prefer unconditional surrender from the Krauts , but this 'll do . 
Congrats on the promotion . 
Don 't go thinking I 'm sore about it . 
Still think you 're the best navigator . 
You seem to be alone in that opinion . 
Well , wish me luck in She 's Gonna . 
She 's Gonna ? 
Wouldn 't you like to know . 
Hey , hey ! Stop the truck ! 
- You okay , Bucky ? 
- Yeah , you guys go on ahead . Catch up in a jeep . 
Jack ! 
- We gotta trade jackets . - [ Jack ] What ? 
Come on . Give me your jacket . 
You serious ? 
They say when we get her back ? 
[ Pappy ] What 's the name of the plane they 're putting us in ? 
Royal Flush . 
" Aw-R-Go " ? What the hell does that mean ? 
[ engineer ] Got it from Framlingham yesterday . 
But it 'll fly . At least that far . 
That makes me feel better . 
[ Bucky ] Thanks , Lloyd . 
[ Brady ] Trade in your sheepskin , Major ? 
Buck always hated that jacket . 
[ Crosby ] The hardest part of any mission was the anticipation . The waiting . 
No matter how well I plotted the routes or how thoroughly I briefed the other navigators , after wheels up , there was nothing I could do . 
Flanagan 's dropping out of formation . 
[ Bucky ] Goddamn it , another one . 
Lead pilot to tail , you see what 's wrong with Flanagan 's bird ? 
Yeah , affirmative . Looks like a bad number four engine . 
Stephen 's sliding in to replace him . 
Lead pilot to navigator , log that as another mechanical , will ya ? 
So , does that make three or four we 've lost ? I 've lost count . Over . 
Four aborts , Major , which leaves us with 13 ships . 
Shit . [ Sighs ] 
There 's no chance that we 're gonna close that gap between us and the 95th before the coast . 
Yeah , we 're giving her all we can . 
Lead pilot to tail , how far back are the 390th ? 
Got to be five miles back , sir . 
There 's too much space for those Jerries to find us in those gaps . Yeah . 
[ Bucky ] Hey , Johnny , maybe it 's time to get down to the nose and man that third gun , all right ? 
[ Johnny ] On my way , Major . 
Christ , I thought he 'd never leave . 
[ Brady ] He 's my copilot . 
He 's just making sure you don 't blow up my ship . 
Well , not today , I 'm not . 
[ Hafer ] Top turret to bombardier . Go for bombardier . 
Okay for me to pull the pins ? 
[ Hambone ] Roger that . 
[ Hafer ] How about oxygen ? You okay back there ? [ Hambone ] The oxygen 's okay . 
Uh , let 's keep your mag , uh , feeder clear there . Just click depress . 
[ Johnny ] Feeder 's clear . Rest of it 's , uh , tied up to the bulkhead . 
[ Hafer ] All right , check the guns . - [ Hambone ] Guns are set . - [ Hafer ] All good ? 
[ Hambone ] Yeah , roger . Guns are set . 
[ Johnny ] .50 cals are knock knock . 
Jesus . How much coffee did you have this morning ? 
Too fucking much . 
Bombs away ! 
Okay , boys , I 'm heading in . All right . 
Escorts are out of gas . They 're headed home . 
Got us through the channel at least . 
Ball turret to crew . Flak dead ahead . 
[ Bucky ] Roger that . 
[ ball gunner ] Ball turret to crew . Flak , 1 : 00 low . 
Flak , 3 : 00 . Six o 'clock . 
[ waist gunner ] Hey ! - Have I ever told you I fucking hate flak ? 
- [ gunner ] Not today . 
[ ball gunner ] Flak got Lauro . They 're dropping out . - Damn . - [ tail ] I see parachutes . 
[ gunner ] Shit ! Stymie 's going down . 
[ Bucky ] Down to 11 . 
Navigator to command pilot , three minutes to IP . Pilot to navigator . Roger that . 
Harry ? Harry ! 
No . [ Grunts ] - [ Brady ] Are we hit ? - Harry ! 
Lead pilot to crew , we good back there ? Over . 
[ breathes heavily ] Clanton ... His fucking face is blown off . 
[ Bucky ] Christ . 
Goddamn it . Harry , breathe , Harry . 
Breathe . Breathe , goddamn it ! 
Harry , don 't you die on me . 
Breathe . 
Please , Harry . [ Grunts ] 
Engine one 's quit . 
Fuck ! Shut off the gas and feather it . 
Clanton 's dead . 
Navigator to pilot , we 're over the IP . Turn to 057 . 
Roger . Coming to 057 . Over . 
Flak 's slowing down , boys . Keep your eyes peeled . Fighters probably all around us . 
Jesus . 
[ Bucky ] Fighters , 12 : 00 . Must be hundreds of those bastards . 
Open fire , let ' em have it ! 
Let 's lower the odds . 
[ screaming ] I 'm hit ! 
I 'm hit ! I 'm hit in my leg ! 
- [ breathes heavily ] My leg ! 
- [ gunner ] I 'm coming ! 
Pilot to bombardier , we are approaching target . Are you ready for her ? Bombardier to pilot . Roger . Pilot to bombardier . Your ship . Roger . Bomb bay doors going open . 
Bogeys , 9 : 00 high ! 
Tail . We 've lost another one ! Last of the low element ! 
Shit ! 
Number three 's on fire ! 
Shutting off gas , and feathering . 
We 're fine ! 
We 're maintaining speed . 
Yeah , just . 
We can make it to the target . 
[ Hambone ] Approximately one minute to bomb release . 
Rockets , 2 : 00 ! 
Lead pilot to nose . What 's going on down there ? We got bombs to drop . 
[ Johnny ] Hambone ! Hambone ! 
[ Brady ] They 're coming in for another run at us . 
Make those bastards pay ! 
Christ , engine four is done ! We 're down to one engine . 
- [ screams , gasps ] - Hambone 's hit bad . 
Engine two is going on us . She 's pulling already . It 's gonna be hard to keep her level . 
- We gotta leave formation . - Fuck . Fuck ! 
Salvo the fucking bombs now ! 
Hit the bailout bell ! 
- Salvo the bombs ! 
[ Johnny ] We 're bailing ! Salvo the fucking bombs ! 
Destroy the bomb sight ! Shoot it ! 
[ grunting ] I can 't hold her steady much longer ! 
- [ exhales sharply ] - [ Johnny ] Hang in there , Hambone ! 
[ Hambone ] Help me ! Get my parachute ! 
[ Rosenthal ] Pilot to navigator , note it in the log : Squad leader Egan leaving formation . 
Roger that . Cruikshank moving into lead position . 
Copy . Navigator to pilot , Major Egan is falling fast . 
Looks like they 're preparing to bail . 
Let 's go ! We got to get out of here now ! 
Hey , give me a hand ! 
[ Hafer ] Petros , let 's go ! 
He should be buried . 
We have to get Harry down . 
George , come on , damn it ! He 's dead ! We gotta get out of here now . Let 's go ! 
- Help ! Help , my harness is caught ! - Hambone ! 
Get me off ! Get me off ! 
- Pull the release ! Pull the release ! - [ grunts ] [ grunts ] 
There they go ! They 're all out ! Let 's get off this dump ! 
- Go ! 
- You go ! 
Goddamn it , Brady , I 'm the senior officer . Now jump ! It 's my ship ! You jump ! 
[ both grunting ] [ screams ] What the hell ! 
All right . I 'll see you , John ! 
I 'm still here , you sons of bitches ! 
We 're over the damn target . Drop ' em , for fuck 's sake , and let 's get the hell out of here . 
Bombardier to pilot . Now ? [ Rosenthal ] Not until the lead drops . 
Now ? 
[ Rosenthal ] Hold . 
[ bombardier ] Now ? 
[ Rosenthal ] Not yet . 
- Now . 
- Bombs away . 
[ ball gunner ] There they go . 
Right on target . 
Flak incoming . 
You okay ? 
- Don 't worry about it . I 'm okay . - Left gunner to pilot . DeBlasio 's hit out of the tail . 
There 's a lot of blood , but I think he 's okay . 
Roger . 
[ Rosenthal ] Pilot to crew . Flak 's stopped . Keep alert . 
Enemy fighters at 10 : 00 high , and 2 : 00 high . 
[ ball gunner ] They 're going after Cruikshank in lead . 
Lead 's going down ! 
I see parachutes ! 
[ top gunner ] 110s are now 5 : 00 high , going level . 
Rockets incoming . Starboard . 
[ Pappy ] Holy shit , there 's a hole in the wing ! 
She 's Gonna is blown to bits ! 
[ Rosenthal ] Any chutes ? 
[ gunner ] Christ , we just lost the high lead and She 's Gonna .

[ kid ] Here they come , Billy . 
I see ' em . Straight ahead . Take maneuvers ! [ imitates gunshot ] 
[ Lemmons ] Twelve o 'clock level . 
[ mechanics speaking indistinctly ] [ kid ] What ? 
It 's like a clock . 
Straight ahead is 12 : 00 . So , behind you is ... - Six o 'clock ? - That 's right . 
[ Billy imitates gunshot ] Open fire ! 
[ kids imitating gunfire ] [ kid ] Drop the bombs ! Now . 
I hear them . 
[ Jack ] It 's not ours . 
That 's 390th . 
[ Harding ] Get one of them on the radio . 
Approaching aircraft , Station 139 . Acknowledge . 
390th aircraft turning onto the approach track , this is tower . Do you read me ? 
You have landed at Station 139 . 
This is the 100th CO . 
Do you know where my group is landing ? 
Pilot ? 
[ Jack ] Where are our boys , Chick ? 
He said none of ' em made it . [ Sighs ] 
None of them ? 
- [ airplane approaching ] - [ soldier ] Here comes another . 
- [ Bowman ] That 's one of ours . 
- [ Harding ] Mmm . Who is that ? 
[ Jack ] It 's one of the new guys . Rosenthal . 
[ Rosenthal ] This is aircraft 087 . We have wounded on board . 
[ radio operator ] Roger , aircraft 087 . Dispatching ambulance . 
Where 's the rest ?

[ Lemmons ] What happened to Bubbles ? 
What about Egan ? 
[ Rosenthal ] After interrogation . 
And Crank ? 
[ Rosenthal ] Later , Kenny . All of ' em ? 
That 's it . 
Fucking it ! 
[ panting ] That 's the last fucking time I 'm going up . 
They can 't make me go up again . I won 't do it . 
I 'm not gonna do it . [ Sighs ] 
It 's the last fucking time I 'm going up . 
[ Bowman ] Tail 230823 . Invadin ' Maiden . That 's Walts 's crew . 
[ navigator ] No record . [ Bowman ] Anyone ? 
Tail 230047 . Sweater Girl . It 's with Atchinson 's crew . 
No record . 
Anyone ? 
Tail 23534 . Ol ' Dad . 
[ navigator ] No record . 
[ Rosenthal ] It was really bad up there , sir . 
We didn 't have much time for logs . 
Tail 230023 . Forever Yours . Stork 's crew . 
Yes , sir . They , uh ... They got hit by a rocket . Early on . 
Uh , it was on fire for a minute or two and then ... [ Bowman ] Did anyone see any chutes ?

[ Bubbles ] Dear Jean , You know this already , but your husband was the best friend I ever had . 
He was also the best navigator I ever met , even though he was too humble to admit it to himself . 
Takes a special kind of courage for a man to stay modest surrounded by blustering blowhards in every direction , but that was Croz . 
I wish more than anything it was him sitting here and not me ... and then no one would have to write this letter . 
[ Rosenthal ] There was a mission to Münster . - It was rough . 
[ Dr. Huston ] Three missions in your first three days . 
120 men dead in one afternoon . 
And I wasn 't one of them . 
I don 't think this , uh , environment is helpful for me . 
I 'd like to return to base . [ Dr. Huston ] This war ... [ sighs ] Human beings weren 't meant to behave this way . 
[ Rosenthal ] You see people being persecuted , subjugated ... - [ shouting , crying ] - ... you have to do something . 
Bubbles , he went down last week . It was my fault . 
You don 't go crying about it . 
You get back in the seat and you finish the damn job .
