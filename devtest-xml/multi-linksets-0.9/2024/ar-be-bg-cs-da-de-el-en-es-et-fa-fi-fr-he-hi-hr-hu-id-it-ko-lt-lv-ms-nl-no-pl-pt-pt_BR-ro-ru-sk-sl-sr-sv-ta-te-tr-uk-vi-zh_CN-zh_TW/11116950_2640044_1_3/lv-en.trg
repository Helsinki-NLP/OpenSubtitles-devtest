Ah-ten-hut ! 
At ease , gentlemen . 
Exactly one year ago to the day , the Eighth Air Force sent up its first maximum effort . 
It was a combined force of 12 B-17s . 
Today , the Eighth will be sending up a max effort with three air task forces . 
- Yeah . - Totaling 376 heavy bombers and 240 fighters . - Not bad , huh ? - Yeah . That 's the largest air armada ever assembled in the history of mankind . Yeah ! Yes ! 
Now , we will be in the first task force targeting the Messerschmitt 109 engine assembly plant in Regensburg . 
Second and third task forces will hit the ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt . 
And no war machine moves without ball bearings . 
If we succeed , we knock German production off line for months . 
There 's no telling how many lives we could save . 
Corporal . 
- Dear God . - Oh , boy . 
This is Regensburg . 
And you 're probably thinking that 's a lot of flying time over Kraut territory . 
It is . 
It 's the deepest we 've attempted to reach . 
But the mighty Eighth has a plan . 
Major Bowman ? 
Go get ' em , Red . 
It 's a three-punch combo and the Krauts will only be able to defend one of them . 
So , execution and timing will be essential . 
Major ? Why does that red line go all the way down to Africa ? 
That is a characteristically astute question , Curt . 
And I 'll answer that in a moment , if I may . All right , all right . Laugh now . All right . Now , the three task forces will assemble over the channel together . And then split here . 
Now , the Luftwaffe will only be able to mount a sizable defense against our first task force before having to head back to base to rearm and refuel . 
And when they finally get back in the air , the second and third task forces should be dropping their bombs on the ball bearing factory in Schweinfurt , while we 're dropping our bombs on Regensburg . 
Now , to answer your question , Curt . 
As we drew the ... How can I put this the shitty end of the stick on the approach , and we 're taking the brunt of the enemy fighters , the brass , they 've come up with an ingenious plan that is sure to confuse the hell out of the Krauts when we 're a no-show for the return . 
That 's because you 're headed to Africa , gentlemen . 
The 12th Air Force will welcome you with open arms , ice-cold beer and lobster tails . 
It 'll be like a holiday . Y 'all like beer . 
If we get lucky . 
Thank you , Red . 
And now for some bad news . 
In our wing , we 're tail-end Charlie . 
Worst spot in the squad . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Lives ain 't worth a nickel . 
The lead squadron is the 418th with Major Kidd as command pilot of the group . 
In addition , Major Egan will be flying in Captain Cruikshank 's fort , as reserve command pilot of the group . 
Major Veal leads the 349th and the 351st in the high position ... What , I got a fucking passenger ? Apparently so . 
There you are . Now , it seems like we have a little tricky weather pressure in the early hours . Stormy ? 
Let me guess , it 's gonna rain . 
Hundred-percent chance . 
That 's quite right , sir . 
Over the base today , gentlemen , cloud cover stands at about five-tenths stratus at 4,000 feet . Topped by five-tenths ... What the hell is a " reserve command pilot " ? 
I don 't know . 
- You had nothing to do with it ? - Visibility will be ... 
Cloud invisibility should be good over the Alps and on your way south to Africa . 
Thank you , Stormy . 
Now , the success of this mission rests upon getting all three task forces precisely coordinated over the channel . 
If we don 't rendezvous in sync , well , there 's no pass fake . 
That means a fake pass in sports talk . 
05 : 20 in ten seconds . 
Good luck , and I 'll see you all in a few days . 
Hack . 
This is Clear-up Radio to aircraft 567 . 
All aircraft are advised that takeoff has been delayed due to heavy fog . 
The entire wing is on temporary hold . Stand by for further instructions . 
Clear-up Tower , this is aircraft 567 . Roger temporary hold . Standing by . Over . 
" Lord , guard and guide the men who fly through the great spaces of the sky . 
Be with them traversing the air in darkening storms or sunshine fair . 
Thou who dost keep with tender might , the balanced birds in all their flight . " Thou of the tempered winds , be near , that having thee they know no fear . " 
All three task forces are socked in . We got a 30-minute delay . 
You 're on the way through purgatory and you reach a fork in the road . 
One road goes to Valhalla , the other goes to hell . Damnation . 
On each of the road is a goblin . 
One goblin always tells the truth . The other is a tricky little fucker . He always lies . Okay ? What 's the one question that you need to ask that 's gonna tell you the right way to go ? 
Jesus Christ . 
- Hey , Lieutenant . You got a visitor . - That is a class woman . 
Stand by for 30 more minutes . 
Do you ever have any good news , Garcia ? You got complaints ? Take it up with operations . Hey ! Strongly worded letter to follow ! 
Delayed another half hour , fellas . 
Why can 't we just take off ? Because we can 't . 
It 's fog . Haven 't the pilots been trained for that ? Yeah . Isn 't that what they get paid for ? Sure . They can fly upside down with a lollipop in their mouth . But if there 's a cow on the runway ... A cow on the runway ? 
Where do you come up with this shit , Quinn ? 
We 're in a flying fortress . We can take on a cow . 
Alice isn 't a Buick , Baby Face . She 's a tin can . 
If we go head-to-head with a cow , she 'd accordion . With us in it . 
I see your cow . 
Peanut butter , peanut butter , peanut butter , jam . 
I 'd turn your cow into ground beef . 
Bucky . 
- Bucky . - Yeah , Crank ? 
How 'd you convince Harding to let you fly ? 
What do you mean ? 
You , Buck , Veal , Kidd ? 
Three squadron COs and an Air Exec . 
Lot of eggs in one basket . 
Yeah , I 've never seen so much brass in the same mission before . 
Well , I wasn 't gonna miss this one , was I ? 
Wait , wait , wait . Do you ask it , " Are you the good goblin ? " 
No . No , but you 're getting closer . 
You 're smarter than I thought , Croz . 
Ten bucks says the second and third task force - is already up in the air . - Nah . 
Nah , they wouldn 't hit their target before we formed up with them . 
What if they do ? 
Then this genius plan is shit . 
Come here , Meatball . Come on . Good boy . 
Hey , Buck . 
Hey , Curt . 
Some soup , huh ? Yeah . 
We have fog like this back home . 
Always spooked me as a kid . 
No one likes the fog . 
How your boys doing ? 
Antsy . 
Not me . 
I 'm feeling good . 
I feel like this could be a big one , you know ? 
- It is . - I think we could do some real damage . 
Well , better get back to the ant farm . 
See you there , Buck . 
Here you go , sir . 
LeMay wants us wheels up . He doesn 't wanna wait for the other task forces . 
What do you mean ? 
They 'll have to catch up , sir . 
Engine start at 06 : 40 . Send up a flare to resume operations . Yes , sir . 
We 're sending them straight into hell . Alone . 
Command pilot to crew . Anyone see the other task forces ? 
- Radio , negative . - Waist negative . Tail , negative . 
Negative , sir . 
Negative . 
Not what they fucking said ! 
They said we 'd get the brunt of it , buddy . Yeah , I know . I know . But the other task forces were supposed to be sweeping up after us to make sure they don 't come back for seconds . Where are they , huh ? 
Via , you sure you don 't see anyone ? 
Not a one of ' em . Still alone . 
Crank ? You think we can get closer to Blakely ? 
Can do . Back seat driver . 
That 's right , Crank . 
Back seat pilot and reserve . 
Come on , Buck . Keep pace with us . 
Looks like we got stood up by the other divisions . 
We 're on our own . 
They ain 't trying too hard with this flak . 
Keeping it clear for the fighters . 
Shit ! Fighters at 10 : 00 low ! Ten o 'clock low ! 
They 're going for Buck . 
Fighters , 2 : 00 ! 
Nine o 'clock low . More Germans . 
- I 'm on the nine ! - More fighters . Two o 'clock level . 
Got you , son of a bitch ! 
More at 11 : 00 low ! 
They 're going for Claytor ! 
Left wing is hit . 
She 's pulling left . 
Left flap locked up . Compensating . 
- Rockets 2 : 00 ! - Holy shit ! 
Shit ! They 've hit Cleven . 
Norman ? Strout ? 
We 're losing air speed . We need to increase power . Do it . Norman ! Strout ! 
We 're both here . 
What 's your damage ? Electrical and oxygen hoses . 
- How 's the bomb sight ? 
- Checking . 
Bombsight is okay ! 
Two 190 's , 2 : 00 . 
Charge handle 's blown off ! 
Two o 'clock low ! 
Jesus . They 're coming from everywhere !

Another from two ! 
All right , Murph . I 'm taking that gun . Sir . 
Ten o 'clock low ! Tail to nose , coming your way . 
- Two o 'clock high ! - They 're gonna split , Murph ! 
They 're going for Buck . 
Fighters , 2 : 00 high ! 
Copy . Got ' em . Hit ' em , boys . 
They 're going after the second element . 
Tail to Cleven . Hummel 's fort is gone . 
You see any chutes ? 
All ten chutes , but Claytor 's in trouble . 
He 's pulling badly . He 's falling out of formation . 
- We 're losing fuel . - Well , I can see that . 
Left wing 's on fire . 
Should we bail , Roy ? Roy ! Roy ! Should we bail ? Should we bail ? 
Pilot to crew , abandon ship . Bail out ! Abandon ship ! Bail out ! - Did you say abandon ship ? - Yes , goddamn it ! Destroy the order and then bail ! 
Pilot to bombardier . Open the bomb bay doors ! Roger . 
Lorch , drop all the bombs . 
Ball turret to crew . I 'm stuck . 
- I can 't get out of the turret . - What do you mean you can 't get out ? 
The elevation clutch is jammed . 
It won 't crank . 
Quinn ! Help me out . 
- Quinn , come on . Help me , man . - Push ! 
Pull on the count of three . 
- Trying ! - One , two , three . 
Come on ! 
Push , Baby Face ! Help me ! 
Come on , Quinn ! Please ! 
Come on , get me out of here . Please ! 
I 'm sorry . 
What do you mean ? No ! No ! 
Come back , Quinn ! Quinn , please ! 
- I can 't . - Get me out of this thing ! 
Help ! 
I can 't . 
Get me out ! Please ! Quinn ! 
- I 'm sorry , Baby Face . I 'm sorry . - No ! No ! 
Tail to lead pilot . Our whole second element is gone . 
Jesus . Roger , tail . 
We need to join the 418th . 
Redmeat Lead to Redmeat Squadron , we 're joining up with Pacer . 
Roger that , Redmeat Lead . Let 's power up . 
We 're gonna climb and get some protection with the 418th . 
Tail to command pilot , the whole last element of the 350th is gone . 
The rest are trying to join us . 
Roger . 
Come on . 
Sir . 
Every Luftwaffe base in Belgium 's been scrambled . And we 're still more than three hours away from the IP . 
Rockets incoming . Seven o 'clock ! 
Christ ! 
Smith , report ! 
Smith ! Smith , report ! 
Smith is down . He 's not breathing . 
Waist to Cleven . Smith is dead , sir . 
Fighters , 11 : 00 high ! 
Son of a bitch ! 
Son of a bitch ! 
- You okay ? - Yeah . 
Then get back up there and man your gun . 
Main electrical panel 's been hit . 
- How bad is it ? 
- Generator 's down . I can 't tell . 
Waist to Pilot . Biddick 's been hit . 
Pressure 's dropping everywhere . All systems . Curt , we 're losing her . 
No , we 're not . 
Dickie ! Dickie ! No ! Best ! Get down here now ! 
He 's on the controls . Get him off . Get him back . 
- How is he ? 
- I think he 's dead . 
No , Dickie . Dickie , wake up ! 
Fuck ! 
She 's not gonna make it . We gotta get out . 
Pilot to crew . Bail out ! Bail out ! 
Here 's your chute , Curt . 
He 's breathing , sir ! 
Dickie , stay with me . 
I 'm gonna get you down safely . You hear me ? You can 't land this thing , can you ? Yes , I can . If we drop him , he 'll die . Drop him . It 's his best chance ! 
- He 's gonna die anyway , Lieutenant . - No , he 's not ! 
We have to bail ! Come on ! 
Go . I 'll be right behind you . Go ! Promise me ! 
I 'll be behind you . 
I 'ma keep her level till everyone bails out . Go ! 
You gotta get out , Curt ! 
I 'm right behind you . Get out ! 
I 'm getting us down , Dick . I have control . 
Right over there . You see it ? That long field , huh ? 
Dickie , stay with me . Come on . 
Come on , Curt . Fly like an angel , huh ? 
Oh , God . 
Sir , the second and third task forces have just crossed the channel . 
Five hours late . 
God help our boys . 
One o 'clock high ! 
- You hit ? - No . You ? 
Got a fluid leak on the port wing . 
I think the column may be jamming on something . 
Left rudder pedal feels loose and I 've only got right rudder . 
- Compensate ! - I can 't . Help me . 
I think we may be done . It 's not responding . 
We can manage it . We 'll use throttles and rudder trim . It 's too much . We need to bail out . Engine three is on fire too . 
- Pilot to crew , get ready to b ... - You son of a bitch ! 
We are going to sit here and take it . You hear me ? 
We 're gonna take it . 
Lead pilot to crew . We 're gonna stick with our mission as long as we can fly . 
Somebody check if that last hit ruptured a fuel tank . 
Navigator to pilot , I see it . We got a leak . 
Roger . 
Looks like the Krauts are heading back to refuel . Keep your eyes peeled . 
They 're refueling . 
How we looking , Croz ? 
Navigator to command . Hitting IP . Command , roger . 
Flares up ! 
IPs . 
Thirty seconds to bomb release . Prepare to hand over aircraft . 
Trimming . 
And holding 155 . 
Autopilot is set and servos on . Pilot to bombardier , your aircraft . 
Roger , my aircraft . Fighters , 10 : 00 high ! Coming in ! 
I got that son of a bitch . 
Bomb bay doors opening . 
Prepare to drop . We 're gonna get it done , boys . 
Bombs away ! 
Take that . 
Bombs away ! 
Jesus . Will you look at that ? 
Lead pilot to ball turret . How 'd we do ? 
Sir , that factory ... is gone . 
Mission accomplished , boys . 
Can we go home now ? 
Not yet , Strout . We gotta make a little pit stop in Africa . 
It 's okay . I ... German ? 
I 'm American . 
Can you help me ? 
Wait here . 
He 's American . 
You 're sure ? 
Yes . 
Command pilot to tail , how many left behind us ? 
Tail to command pilot , nine . 
They 're scattered everywhere , I got ' em left and right . 
Is Cleven 's fort still with us ? 
They 're beat to shit and trailing way behind , but they 're still with us . 
Roger . 
Menzie , we 're pulling left . How are the elevators looking ? 
The left one is shot to hell . 
It 's not working . 
Tail to pilot . We lost another fort . 
I think it was Oakes . 
Roger . 
Major , I don 't know how much longer we can hold this . 
We 're okay . 
- I think if we 're gonna ditch , we should ... - We can make it . 
Elevator line is shot to shit , sir . What 's our pl ... I 'm not planning to sit this thing out in a stalag , are you ? 
Menzie , Hollenbeck and DeMarco following ? Tail to pilot . DeMarco 's sticking with us . 
Hollenbeck is abandoning ship . Eight chutes ... Nine . All ten . 
That 's good , Menzie . 
Norman . Strout . How you doing ? 
We 're okay , sir ! 
Just taking in the view and the fresh , thin air . 
You did good . I 'm glad I had you with me . 
And that goes for the rest of you rabble on this fort too . 
Great job , fellas . 
Hey , Doug ? 
Yeah ? 
Do you know when we lost Biddick ? 
I didn 't have time to mark it in the log . 
Jesus , Croz , I don 't think a goddamn navigator in the entire wing - had time to work the logs . - Yeah , I just want to get it right , okay ? 
I know , Croz . 
I guess they went down 1100 . 
Yeah . Got it . 1100 . 
We 're under 600 , sir . 
Pilot to navigator . We got just under 600 gallons left . 
Can it get us to Africa ? No , Major . It looks like we might need more like 750 , at present speed . 
We 've been leaking fuel since the IP . Roger . 
Lead pilot to crew . We need to stretch our range as much as possible . 
Dump everything not bolted down . Bombsight , guns , ammo , everything . 
Bombardier to pilot . You say my bomb sight ? 
We 're over water , Norm . Krauts won 't get it . Let it go . 
Release the turret . 
Pilot to top turret , how we looking up there ? 
Pretty ragged , but okay , sir . 
Garrison , how are the stragglers looking back there ? 
DeMarco 's clean . Cleven 's dumping now . 
It looks like Van Noy 's gonna ditch in the water . 
Navigator to pilot , Van Noy ditched smoothly in water . Approximately 350 miles from land . 
Roger . 
Is it good ? Yeah . 
Louise ... Turn around . Turn around . 
You will not know my name , and you will forget my face . Yes ? 
Yes . 
Do you want to escape back to England ? - Yes . - I can help you . 
But know this , if you turn yourself in to the Germans now , you will become a prisoner under the Geneva conventions and likely you will survive the war . 
But if you choose to attempt to escape , you will be treated as a spy if captured , and likely you will be executed . 
Do you understand ? 
And which do you choose ? Surrender ? Or escape ? 
Crank ? That it ? That Africa ? 
Yes , it is . Pilot to crew . Africa dead ahead ! 
Command , navigator . 
Croz , are we where we 're supposed to be ? 
' Cause if we 're not , we 're gonna land in that sand . Yeah . 
We should be seeing the base at 184 any minute . 
Croz , we 're running on fumes . Are you sure about this ? 
I 'm telling the truth , gentlemen . As sure as I can read and count . 
Come on . 
Fork in the road here , Croz . We could do with the answer to that riddle . 
The answer to the riddle 's 184 . Keep your eyes peeled . 
I think I see it . 
Twelve o 'clock . And change . 
Close enough , Croz . Close enough . 
- Oh , man . - All right . Nice work . 
Command pilot to Zootsuit Two , airfield 's in sight . 
- Pilot to crew , prepare for landing . - To Valhalla , boys . 
Valhalla here we come , fellas . 
Landing gear down . 
Landing gear coming down . Right gear down . 
Left gear down . Quarter flaps . 
Well done , boys . 
Hey , Blakely , what was the answer to that riddle ? 
I was hoping you 'd tell me . 
Well , pretty sure this ain 't Valhalla . 
Well , we made it , boys . Where 's the welcoming committee ? 
God . Welcome to Africa , boys . 
There 's the airstrip . Due south . 
We 're dropping fuel pressure on four . Feathering . 
I 'm gonna sharpen the turn to the runway . 
- Now we 're losing engine two . - Feather it . 
All engines feathered . 
That 's it . We 're a glider now . 
200 feet . Landing gear down . Wait . It 'll slow us down . 
- Landing gear now ? 
- Wait . 
100 feet . 
Wait . 
Now . 
Right landing gear down . 
Left down . Flaps at quarter . 
Better late than never . Yeah . Let 's get that kÃ¼belwagen . 
You boys okay ? - Yeah . - Hey , Norm . 
- You all right ? - Pull the med kits off the plane . - Let 's get these guys in the wagon . - Guys , I 'm fine . 
- Get him on the wagon . Listen to Kidd . - Up . - Look after him , all right ? - I got him . 
- Major , I got him . - You got him ? 
Come on . 
I don 't know how you flew that thing all the way to Africa , but you couldn 't make the runway . 
It 's right there . 
Oh , boy . 
- Who is it ? 
- Norman Smith . Radio operator . 
I lost four forts . I know . 
- How many of us made it ? 
- Eleven out of 21 . 
What about Claytor ? Any chutes ? 
I didn 't see any . Yeah . And Curt ? 
I don 't know . 
Yeah , well , knowing Biddick , he 's probably sipping on a bottle of schnapps right about now . 
We 're gonna get through this . Come on . Don 't you stop believing that . 
Sure , Bucky . 
She 's your guide , and you will do what she says . 
Get your things , boys . We 're going home . 
All these are new faces ... Major Egan . Major Cleven . 
Think you might be the last pretty face I ever see . 
Feels like we 're actually gonna do something . 
Yeah , you 'll do something , all right . 
To the fellas who aren 't here tonight , who should 've been . 
German . They have tried many ways to infiltrate our network . 
We go down , they won 't remember us either . Like we never existed , Buck . 
What happened to Baby Face ? Is he dead ?
