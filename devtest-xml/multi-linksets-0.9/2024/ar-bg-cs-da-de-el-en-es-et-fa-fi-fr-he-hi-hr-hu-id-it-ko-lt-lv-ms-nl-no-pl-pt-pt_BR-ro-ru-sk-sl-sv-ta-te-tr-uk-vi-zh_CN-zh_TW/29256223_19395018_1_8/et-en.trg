Alice . 
Even if I 'm not here ... I 'm always with you . 
No matter what happens , my eyes are always on you . 
Houston . This is Birdsong . 
They are alive . 
I must 've passed out . They 're breathing . 
I can see their breath ! 
But they were dead ... Christ ! 
I can see their breath . 
They are alive . 
Passed out . 
They 're breathing . 
I can see their breath ! 
They are alive . 
They 're breathing . I can see their breath . 
Daddy , sit down . 
Sit down . 
Listen . Mummy died . 
I 'm sorry . 
She died in the accident . Excuse me ? 
Her body 's still up there . 
You just spent two days with her at the cabin . 
I heard it . 
Mummy 's alive . She 's just not with us . 
We lost our mummy . 
And there 's another Alice . 
It 's her mummy who came back . 
There 's somewhere else . 
Something to do with the CAL . 
Mummy has a mental illness . 
Whatever she 's told you , it 's ... it 's not true . 
Mummy 's alive . 
You 're wrong , Daddy . 
There 's something wrong with the machine . The image is corrupted . 
Show me . 
The charges are that Mr. Caldera shot Commander Paul Lancaster at 60556 Lexington Avenue at approximately 21 : 05 on Monday the 8th of November , 2021 . Furthermore , that Mr. Caldera threw Mr. Ian Rogers from the stern of the SS Bernice , off the coast of Santa Barbara at 23 : 35 on Sunday the 17th of October , 2021 , causing the death by drowning 
Go on . 
Mr. Caldera says he 's not the person who committed these crimes . 
Furthermore , he requests a polygraph test in order to establish his identity ... and the memory of these things . 
I need you to compare my DNA with the inhabitant of Bud Caldera 's apartment . 
But you don 't deny that you are Henry Caldera . 
I think we already established that who I am not is Bud Caldera , so-called . 
What I would suggest is that these two gentlemen are one and the same person . 
With all respect , they are not . 
I need you to establish where Bud Caldera lives , what his personal and economic circumstances are . 
In short , I need help knowing what his life is . 
Read this . 
Well , Christ knows how much it cost . Probably millions . 
But she 's taken a fucking axe and given it 40 fucking whacks . 
I 'm sorry . 
On behalf of the European Space Agency . 
She 's being treated . We 're going to dismiss her . 
- Really ? - Yes . 
I remember , back in ' 64 , first intake of lady astronauts . 
They just finished their physical , right ? And Steven Winderuss , the head of ops at the time , he wrote a report discussing the problem of women in space and the intricacies of matching a temperamental psychophysiological object , i.e. a woman , to a complicated machine , i.e. a spacecraft . 
It is ... a problem we never solved . 
Henry , you 're not concerned about this ? No . No . What ? It 's a thing . We got lives to live . 
What is happening ? 
Why am I locked in ? 
Why am I here ? 
You speak English ? You speak Russian ? Wait , wait , wait ! Please ! Please ! Wait . Wait , wait , please ! Hello ? Just ... Just please come back ! Please ! 
Has she got her phone ? I don 't know . 
Why don 't you know ? 
I have to talk to her about some things . 
I thought you thought she was dead . 
Alice . Eat your breakfast . 
- It tastes like shit . 
- It does not taste like shit . You 've never tasted shit . 
Look , you can 't see your mother if you keep believing all this rubbish that she tells you . 
This isn 't PTSD . It 's not psychosis . It 's not schizophrenia . 
That 's what all schizophrenics and psychotics say . 
I need to get back to my daughter . 
You play the piano , correct ? 
Play . 
There was a fire at my cabin . 
Before that ... I saw my daughter . The real one . I haven 't seen her since before I went into space . 
Play . 
Are you a mother ? 
You were traveling with your daughter . 
She was very sick after the fire , but now she 's fine . 
She 's with her father . 
I could smell her . 
The real Alice . 
I ... I could smell my daughter . I ... I could . If this condition is not treated , believe me , it will get worse . 
Why would you stop me from seeing her ? 
Please . She 's my baby . 
She 's my baby and I lost her . 
You 're pregnant . 
You know we have to perform pregnancy test before administering lithium . 
It can be very toxic for the fetus . What ? 
- Normally , we would give you ... - No . 1,800 milligram of lithium-7 to calm your symptoms , but you 're in the early stages of pregnancy . Four weeks . 
We have designed an alternative drug therapy to treat you , but you must commit to it . Otherwise we need to shock you again . 
I can 't have this child . 
If I have this child , how will I get back to her ? 
Please . Take these pills . 
I can see you are in pain . 
I can handle pain ! 
This isn 't madness . 
I need to go back to her . Do you understand ? I can 't be here . 
What the fuck is that noise ? 
There is another guest . 
You won 't see this person . 
Incurable . 
Please don 't go ... 
It 's ... It 's you . 
There are flames ... Fire ! Fire ! 
Capsule is on fire . Forty . Forty-two . 
I 'm hot . 
The world is the wrong way round . 
It 's Irena . I need to see you . It 's urgent . 
Have you ever met Ian Rogers ? 
I don 't know who that is . 
Have you ever been aboard the SS Bernice ? 
Not to my knowledge . 
Did you meet with Paul Lancaster at your home in East Hollywood ? 
I do not have a home in East Hollywood , therefore I didn 't meet with Paul Lancaster . 
Have you ever met Paul Lancaster ? 
Many times . 
What were the circumstances of your meeting him ? 
I don 't recall the original circumstances , but we were both employed by NASA , doing the ISS program : I as Chief Technician on the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory , he as an astronaut and mission commander . 
Did you shoot Paul Lancaster ? No . 
But I believe I may have killed him . How ? 
I invented a machine that caused ... or rather allowed for , the circumstance of a fatal accident in space . 
I would love to hear you play . 
- Hello ! 
Did ... Did they ask you to come ? 
D ... Have you ... Have you spoken to Magnus ? 
Did you see Alice ? 
I 've been asking a lot of questions about this condition . 
Why don 't you play ? 
I never heard you play the piano before . 
Ilya , this might sound crazy , but it ... but it 's not a condition . 
Listen , I 've been reading about Henry 's work . D ... 
Do you know where Henry Caldera is ? 
Wh ... What he 's doing ? Maybe I could talk to him . 
They call it " astronaut burnout . " 
Sense of dissociation . Paranoia . Feeling that familiar places and people are impostors . 
It 's happened many times . 
Good news is they can medicate it . 
Why did you come here ? 
Irena is sick . She 's hoping I take over . 
There needs to be someone here who can , look after people . 
Ilya , I 've heard recordings of the radio transmissions from her capsule . It broke up in space . She died . 
Irena was the body that hit the ISS . 
Paul didn 't die . It was me . 
Jo , if she was the body that hit the ISS , how is it that she 's here ? 
The same way as I 'm here . 
We c ... We came from ... From somewhere else . 
The most straightforward explanation for the fact that you 're both here is that you both returned alive . 
I don 't remember her . 
She 's the head of Roscosmos , and I don 't remember her . 
I don 't remember the CAL . I don 't remember Henry Caldera . I don 't remember my daughter . 
So there 's something wrong with your memory . 
Go away . 
There is so much for you here , Jo . 
Stop grieving and get better . 
Please . 
If you don 't get better , you will only get worse . 
I thought I saw her . In the snow . 
And for a moment , I was ... I was so happy to see her again . 
I felt how much I missed her and how much I loved her ... and how sorry I was . 
And then she was gone . 
I 'm stuck in the middle . And they 're both going through things that I have absolutely no idea about . 
They 've got secrets that I 'm not a part of . 
I don 't know how to move on from that . 
And I don 't know how to move Alice on from that . 
How ... How do we get back together again ? 
Do you wanna get back together again ? 
Feels like we 're all floating in space . 
It just feels like we 're all floating in space . 
Boy , I 'll tell ya , - this is better than what I 'm used to . - Henry . 
You make me feel obscurely better . 
What ? 
What 's different ? Come on . 
You know ... a long time ago , when I was in training , Irena Lysenko , she went up to space . And , um ... And she came back down in one piece . 
And my . What a fine-looking girl she was . 
I never met her . But then I went away . 
For a long time , I wasn 't myself . 
But that 's when I recall hearing that there was an accident up there and , in fact , Irena Valentina Lysenko suffocated to death . 
That is the illness that makes you think that . 
Henry , we both went through an accident . Felt strange to come back . It sure as hell was . 
You said you felt another person walking alongside you . 
Someone has been sleeping in my bed and wearing my clothes and eating my fucking porridge . 
Now , you 're the expert . Now , if I start taking these again , is that going to smooth out my little personality disorder ? 
Henry ... what 's the matter ? 
I 'm not Henry . 
Henry is gone . 
And knock on wood , if I 'm lucky , he 'll never be around again . But he will remember who he was and he will live my old age , my addictions and my fucking failures . 
You need to come back with me to St. Sergius . I can help you . No , I don 't need help . 
I ... I am the guy who won the Nobel Prize . 
I had my photo taken with Reagan and Muhammad fucking Ali . 
That 's me . 
And you can keep on denying it and covering it up , just like you always have . 
Do you believe in ghosts ? 
I don 't know . 
Sometimes I think my dad is here . 
I know he died , but sometimes I think he 's here . 
Wendy , I-I think my mum 's dead and there 's another one here who 's alive . 
I 'd trade places with you . 
Half alive and half dead is better than all dead . 
Maybe some people can be there and not there . 
What happened to your dad ? 
He was a bit crazy at Mamma 's funeral , whatever . 
I don 't know . 
He went to see an astronaut and got shot . 
He 's in the hospital now . 
I 'm kind of sad . 
I 'm still sad about my mamma . 
I think I saw her ghost . 
Your dad 's cool though . 
He 's grumpy . 
He 's a nice dad . 
Yeah . I guess he is . 
Daddy , I know it 's all make-believe ... what she said . 
I know she didn 't die . 
I 'm very glad to hear you say that . 
So , can we go see her ? 
- Do you want the stuff in this box ? 
It 's some things they found outside the cabin . Yeah . 
Alice , last chance . You wanna check upstairs so you haven 't left anything ? 
Can you hear me ? 
You wanna play a game ? 
Is Mamma there ? 
I wanna know if I really saw her at the cabin . 
Please ? 
I wanna talk to her . Please . 
Well , we 're going now . 
There . 
I 'm not going to look for Mamma anymore . 
There is another Alice . She 's somewhere else . 
She got Mamma instead of me . 
Well , that 's a great way to look at it . 
I can 't be angry at the other Alice just for being luckier . 
I 'm very proud of you . 
Am I brave ? 
You 're incredibly brave . 
And the polygraph ? 
Passed with flying colors . 
And the DNA ? 
If I am right , mine twist in a different direction from which you found at Bud Caldera 's . 
Nope . The DNA is exactly the same . 
And the polygraph only proves that you think that what you 're saying is true . 
It is true . 
The truth is a rare commodity these days . 
Has that passed you by ? 
Henry , also known as Bud Caldera , I am formally charging you for the murder of Ian Rogers and the attempted murder of Commander Paul Lancaster . 
You do not have to say anything , though it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court . 
And so we move on to the night of the so-called " double event . " Three weeks after the murder of Annie Chapman , September the 30th , 1888 . 
And it was a wet , miserable evening . And extremely dark . 
At 1 : 00 a.m ... the steward of the club steered his pony and barrow through that arch , into the passageway . 
The pony shied to the left , spooked by something lurking in the shadows of the alley . 
Jack the Ripper . 
If we move on to the next location , I can show you where . 
What the fuck ? 
I 'm a retired police officer . 
I know . 
Live your best life , Ian Rogers . 
How are you ? 
Who are the men upstairs ? There is only one man . 
Who is he ? 
The first man in space . 
- What ? 
- Take your medication . 
Play the piano . 
Do things your body is familiar with . It helps . 
Otherwise , trust me , you will break in two . 
Did I die up there ? 
Can I get back ? 
Can I ever get back ? 
Are there two of you ? 
One dead , one alive ? 
Are there two of me ? 
How does that improve our knowledge of ourselves ? 
But if this is what happens up there ... Enough . 
You have a child here to be mother to . 
And another , maybe , on the way . 
Accept this and let go . 
How could I ? I ... I ... I can 't . 
Because whatever it is , it cannot be undone . 
You cannot change it . 
Ever . 
It 's done . 
Live . 
I 've been thinking about the other Alice . 
I think she feels that it 's okay and that you 're here with me . 
I feel that she thinks it 's okay . 
We both lost someone , but we found someone too . 
Doesn 't mean we have to forget the other one . 
Just means we have to accept it . 
Do we accept it ? 
You 're a remarkable young person , Alice . 
Your mother would be incredibly proud of you . 
Are you proud of me ? 
I need a mummy . 
I need an Alice . 
That 's me . Mummy , that can be me . 
This is what I saw . 
This is what collided with the ISS . 
Alice drew this . 
Well , she probably heard you talking about it . 
I 'm trying to be rational , Magnus . My husband is here . 
My daughter is here . 
It 's obviously the same world that I left . 
But what ? 
I 'm gonna start taking the pills ... if it means that I ... I won 't be living on this knife edge . 
And what about this baby ? 
You always wanted another , but we haven 't talked about it since before you went into space . 
Are we in any fit state to have it ? 
Do you want to have it ? 
Do you ? 
My name is Irena Valentina Lysenko . 
I 'm Executive Controller of Roscosmos . 
In 1967 , I became the second woman in space . 
Since that time under the USSR , and since the fall of Communism , it has been my burden and my responsibility to conceal a basic fact about space travel . 
That it drives people mad . 
We know this . 
You know this . 
We pretend it 's not true , but very many of us see and hear things that cannot be explained ... perhaps not even by calling it " madness . " 
I 'm asking whether you might be willing to report any of your own issues anonymously to me . 
Paul , let go . 
- I 've seen something ! 
I am sorry . 
Things are different . 
Magnus , do ... do I seem like your Jo ? 
I love you . 
I love you , and I ... I want you more than I did . 
Me too . 
Can I sit with you ? Sure . 
Thank you for taking care of her . 
Here . 
What 's your name ? 
Irena Valentina Lysenko . 
But my friends call me Valya . 
Down the rabbit hole with you , Alice . 
To infinity and beyond ! 
Just give me a minute , yeah ? 
Mamma ? 
Can I ask you a question ? 
If what happened happened ... If I 'm from here and Daddy 's from here and you 're from there ... where 's the baby gonna be from ? 
Alice , even if I 'm not here ... I 'm always with you ... and Daddy . 
I don 't think you understand how much I ... I just wanted to be around and see you grow up . 
No matter what happens ... my eyes are always on you . 
And my heart ... beats with you , baby . 
I love you so much . More than you can ever imagine . 
My love .
