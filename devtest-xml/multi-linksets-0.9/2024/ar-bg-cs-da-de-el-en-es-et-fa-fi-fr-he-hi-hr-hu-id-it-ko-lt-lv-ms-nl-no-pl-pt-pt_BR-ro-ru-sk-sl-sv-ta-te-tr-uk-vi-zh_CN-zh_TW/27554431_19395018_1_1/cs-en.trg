Conditions worse ... Why don 't you answer ? There are flames ... Fire ! Fire ! Capsule is on fire . 
Twenty-one ... Twenty-one ... Thirty ... forty ... forty-two ... There are flames ... 
Could we please have it a bit warmer ? 
It 's broken , honey . Snuggle down . 
Mummy ? What 's she saying ? 
She 's saying ... that the world is the wrong way around . 
When 's Daddy coming ? 
Mummy ? 
What 's happened to Daddy ? 
Close the door , honey . 
It 's freezing . 
Come , I 'm gonna get the fire started . 
Can I have a story ? 
I can read for you . The iPad one . 
The space one . I prefer it . 
Hi , I 'm Johanna . I 'm an astronaut . And I work for the European Space Agency . I live on the International Space Station . I 'm going to be up here for a whole year . And I got a very special bedtime story . It 's called " The Little Rocket Girl . " 
- Do you want me to read it ? - Yes . 
So , it goes like this . " Up and out in space , it 's very cold . " 
The stars move fast and the sun burns hot just to try to stay warm . 
Up and out in space , it 's very quiet . 
But the worst thing about up and out in space " is that it can be very , very lonely . " 
Alice ? Leaving in 15 . 
I 'll be right down . 
Stand by . 
- I 'm all ready to go . - Okay . Say hi . 
Mission control connecting you now . 
Mamma ? Good morning , honey ... Have you brushed your teeth ? Yes . How many minutes ? Three minutes . 
' Cause that 's what we do in our family . 
Are you going on your space walk today ? 
You don 't need to worry , honey . We 're ready for it . 
I know . 
Would you like to say good morning to Yaz ? 
- Hi , Alice . Good morning . - Hey , Yaz . 
Are you nervous ? 
Just a little bit . 
Do you wanna take a look at the lettuce ? I think they 're looking fairly perky . 
Some of them have woken up a bit . 
What do you think ? 
- Isn 't it magical ? 
- Looks good . 
But I might let one - of the others try it first . - Yes . Just a bit worried that it might turn me into an alien . 
We have to whisper . Why is that ? 
' Cause they 're doing something very fiddly at the CAL . 
Hey , Alice . 
Hi , Paul . 
Your mom 's big day today . 
RPL . CAL data : Core signals green , magnets aligned , 25.5 . 
- Copy , phase six . - Copy . 
Core temperature : Minus 203 degrees . Tune lasers . Come on . 
What does it do ? 
It 's looking for a new state of matter . 
What does that mean ? 
Don 't know . 
Eighty-four days till you 're home . Only 84 . 
I can 't wait . Aw . 
I miss you so much . 
I miss you too , Mamma . 
Will you be careful when you go out there ? Always . 
I 'll see if I can see you . 
- Wow . - Look . There you are . You see ? 
- We 're ready . - All right . 
Good luck , son . 
Good luck , Commander . 
I 've always been lucky till now . 
Hey , Alice . Wave to yourself . 
Begin . 
Station , RPL , do you copy ? Get them back . We 're in the middle of something . 
Mamma ? Are you there ? 
Everything all right ? 
She 's gone . 
Debris ! Scallation ! 
Mamma ? 
Houston , this is Station . Do you copy ? 
Houston , this is Station . Do you copy ? 
- GC , lock the doors . - Repository is not activated . 
Station , Houston on space to Ground 1 , you have a depressurization . 
All comms are open . 
Crew gather in Soyuz 1 evacuation capsule . 
Initiate pre-evacuation protocols . Execute emergency response . 
Houston , fire and fog in Zarya . 
- Power down . - Ilya ! 
Jo , go immediately to nearest evacuation capsule , Soyuz 1 . 
Houston , there 's a fire between us and Soyuz 1 . 
Gather in Rassvet instead . 
Jo , I can 't get through ! 
Ilya , we need to get to the evacuation capsule ! 
Copy . 
What the fuck hit us ? Something hit us ! 
Get through now ! 
I 'm out . 
Brace me ! 
I 'll get the hatch . 
Station , you need to suffocate the fire . 
Copy ! On it ! 
Shutting off pressurization in Zvezda . Something hit us . 
- You guys okay ? 
- Hatch secured . 
Crew , roll call . 
Ericsson . 
Andreev . 
- Brostin . 
- Suri . 
- Lancaster ? 
- I 'm stuck . 
Air is clear . 
Ericsson , Brostin , air is clear . Assist Commander Lancaster . 
Copy . 
Andreev , Suri , check systems and life support . 
- We 're on it . 
- Checking . 
Houston , we 're losing oxygen . - I can hear it . 
- Station , copy . 
Paul ? How are you doing ? 
- I 'm stuck . 
- He 's pinned in . 
- He 's covering the depress . 
- We need to tourniquet him here . - Apply pressure on the artery . - Here , got it . 
- Houston , Paul 's injured . 
- Copy . 
His left arm is crushed beneath rack four . He 's bleeding heavily . 
What 's the status of the systems ? 
Ilya , what 's the status ? 
Power outages in 55 % of Zvezda and Quest . 
Depress in Harmony , Columbus . 
Jo You 're in control now . 
We need to give him oxygen . - Copy . 
- Go , go , go . 
Crew , assess viability of Soyuz evacuation capsule . 
You 're signaling serious oxygen and pressure loss across the ISS . 
Copy . Ilya ? 
- Paul , you 're staying with me , huh ? - Yeah . Audrey , you need to prep Paul for immediate evacuation . 
Just breathe . 
- Are you with me ? - He 's unfit for evacuation . 
Jo , electrical failure in Soyuz 1 capsule . 
Signals : 95 % electrical failure . 
Soyuz 2 functional . Soyuz 1 damaged . 
There 's only three places in Soyuz 2 . We can only evacuate three of us . 
Critical damage to all life support and systems . 
Stand by . You 're currently unable to launch Soyuz 1 . 
Pump . 
If we can 't move him , we 're gonna have to amputate the arm . I 'm so sorry , Paul . - Jo ... 
- You 're gonna be okay . 
Jo ? Ilya ? You were scheduled to do a space walk this morning . 
You need to complete the space walk in order to fix life support and damage to Soyuz 1 . 
I wanna come back . Okay . He 's out . What about Paul ? 
Jo , Audrey can take care of Paul . Got it . 
You need to assess damage to Soyuz 1 evacuation capsule . Fix life support and power . - Copy . 
- Then we can bring you home . 
Here we go . 
Okay , come on . This is terrible . We can 't both be late . 
If you 're paying attention , we were six seconds into deploying the laser at the time of the accident . 
The CAL would have retrieved information within two millionths of a second . 
Keep it below minus 120 degrees and get a retrieval plan . 
Commander , there 's a signal from the CAL . Something 's coming through . 
Irena Lysenko , Roscosmos . 
Commander Henry Caldera . - Chief Scientific Consultant ... - Henry . Rocket Propulsion Laboratories . 
- Look . - Michaela Moyone , NASA Mission Control . 
- Oh , my God . - Frederic Duverger . Head of European Space Agency . 
- So we had a serious collision ... - Come here . You see this ? - on the ISS ... - Holy shit . And we need to discuss a full evacuation . 
Alice , hey , come on . 
Okay , everybody in your seats . 
Good morning . 
Are you okay , Wendy ? 
I had nightmares . 
Jo , Ilya , your objective is to assess the damage to the electrical and life support systems . Understood . 
Okay , Jo . And you have a go for hatch opening . 
Copy . 
Hatch is open and secure . - I 'm heading outside . 
- I 'm right behind you , Jo . 
Jo , Ilya , handing you over to Roscosmos Control to handle the space walk . 
Good luck . 
Copy . Understood . 
We 'll direct . Let 's get it fixed . 
Okay , that 's both of us clear of the hatch . You 're gonna be in the dark for approximately 20 more minutes . 
Copy . 
Jo , Soyuz 1 capsule is signaling total power loss . 
You need to fix power cables on Unity . 
Got it . 
Ilya , you 're heading down to check escape capsule Soyuz 2 . 
Copy that . 
Over Nauka , approximately eight meters . 
Some superficial damage . 
But Soyuz 2 looks like it 's more or less intact . 
Houston station , operation completed on Paul . 
Copy . 
ISS is down to 30 % life support . 
ESA , you cannot overstate the importance of this experiment . 
We got a signal . A double-quantum signal . That is highly significant . We appreciate the importance , RPL , but we can 't prioritize NASA experiments over arranging an evacuation . 
Don 't lecture me about the evacuation , Frederic . 
I 've been doing this for 50 years . 
If we abandon ISS in the current political climate , we 're never going back . 
NASA , the science is not more important than the people . 
We 're not running a goddamn kindergarten up there . 
We found another state of matter that can only exist in zero gravity . 
Now , whatever is wrong up there , it can be fixed . 
We got severe collision damage to the power supply . 
Oxygen system , external power cables sheared through from this side . 
Cannot reconnect . 
Damage irreparable . 
Houston , please advise . 
Paul is going into cardiac arrest . 
Starting CPR . 
One and two and three and four and five and six ... Terminate EVA . Terminate EVA . 
Prepare Soyuz 2 for immediate reentry . 
EVA and Houston , disregard that command . - That command is not agreed . - RPL . Houston , keep this loop clear . 
I will not allow us to make that decision until we have the schematics to retrieve the CAL experiment . 
Disagree . Let 's end this call now and get them down from there . 
Sergei , continue with the space walk . 
Jo , medical team is working on Paul . Continue with EVA . 
Copy . 
Keep me posted . 
Where am I heading now ? 
Tell her to head to the truss . It 's critical they fix secondary life support systems . 
What is the issue ? Jo , we can 't see what you see . 
I got a red light . 
It 's a fault . Sorry . We 've got no cameras operating past Unity . 
She needs to keep going . 
Okay . One minute till sunrise . 
Twenty-seven , 28 , 29 , 30 . 
Sunlight in five , four , three , two , one . Jo , you need to head to the truss to fix secondary life support , otherwise , there won 't be power or oxygen for the crew repairs on Soyuz 1 . Copy . 
Keep in mind we have no cameras on the truss . They are all down . 
We are flying blind from here . Okay . Heading over to secondary life support systems . 
Twenty-eight , 29 , 30 . 
- Stop . - Clear . 
- Start . 
The truss is coming into view . 
Get amiodarone . 
Twenty-one , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . 
Whatever hit us completely destroyed secondary life support systems . 
This is a substantial impact . 
One and two and three and four ... - Can you see what caused it ? 
Working my way closer . 
Looks like it 's a ... maybe ... 50 centimeter tear . 
There 's something tangled up in the ... in the truss . 
Ilya , can you copy ? 
Almost with you . 
Jo , please confirm visual . 
It 's orange fabric . 
I think I need to go from above . 
Come back . Shit . It 's a body . 
Jo , please confirm . 
Jo , respond . 
Ilya , we need visuals on Ericsson . 
Jo ! I 'm coming ! 
Check my O2 mix . 
Come on , Jo . 
I got you . 
She 's secured . 
Tell him to get a visual . 
Andreev , get a visual . 
Negative . 
It was a woman . USSR . Soviet . 
I saw a dead female cosmonaut . 
Come on ! Come on , I 'm not giving up ! 
Houston , TsUP ... Paul is dead . 
I repeat , Commander Lancaster is dead . 
I 'm ... I 'm sorry to pass this on . Station is reporting that Commander Lancaster has died . 
He has died following cardiac arrest . 
Bye , Paul . 
Soyuz 2 , prep for undock complete . 
Deorbit Parameters are up linked . Families in transit to Baikonur . 
Which is no fucking good if we 're all dead , is it ? 
Take it easy . 
We have a repair schedule for Soyuz 1 . 
Three of you leave now in Soyuz 2 , the remaining crew member fixes power damage in Soyuz 1 using 606 batteries from the Russian command module . 
Then Soyuz 1 is clear to return . 
Why don 't two of us go now in Soyuz 2 and two of us stay to repair Soyuz 1 ? 
Insufficient life support to sustain more than one person . 
So , Ilya , Yaz ... Audrey , you came up in Soyuz 2 . 
Jo , I 'll stay . 
No , you 're the Soyuz commander . 
You bring these two back home . 
That 's an order . 
What about Alice ? 
We 've all got families . 
It 's a bit sticky , isn 't it ? 
I 'll tell you what , Luka , why don 't we just take the wings off and-and ... Or maybe we just start again with this guy , shall we ? 
Is she gonna come back ? 
I hope so . 
Why don 't you say yes ? 
Because I don 't wanna lie to you . 
Listen , darling . 
Mummy has every chance of coming back , but it 's tricky . 
Nobody 's ever not come back from space before . Not from an ESA flight . 
I have to tell you something . 
It 's quite upsetting . 
I 'm afraid Wendy 's dad has died . 
What are we gonna do with our bikes ? 
We left our bikes . 
Duration of SKD burn , two minutes 57 seconds . 
- Entry angle , 95 degrees . - Ready to go ? 
- Parameters are set . 
- Ready to go . 
Anything you want us to say ? 
Take a message home ? 
If I don 't make it back , will you please be around for Magnus and Alice ? 
Tilting station . 
Thrusters tested . 
Full power . Unbolt . 
Copy . 
Bolt , armed . 
Fire thruster , KDU engines in three , two , one . Mechanical disconnect . 
I see separation . 
Moving into approach trajectory . 
Time to land : Three hours 27 minutes . 
God willing . 
Jo , you are to fill Soyuz 1 with enough provisions for 24 hours . 
How much life support do I have ? 
How much oxygen ? 
Approximately 19 hours . 
- Just listen to me . - Go on through to the back , Alice . 
- I apologize again profoundly . - Yes . Oh , Christ . I am so , so sorry . Wendy , why don 't you go and sit with Alice ? 
I 'm so sorry , Frida . 
Do you want my rabbit ? 
Soyuz 1 is damaged . 
It has breathable atmosphere but doesn 't have enough power to get you home . 
Once you 've filled Soyuz 1 with supplies , you need to remove the dead batteries and replace them with the 606 batteries up in Zvezda . 
You 'll have oxygen and power in the ISS every 45 minutes to do repairs . 
Copy . 
Jo , your family are on their way . 
You can speak to them when you get back to daylight . Great . 
Close main hatch . 
- Pressurize . 
- Copy . 
Wait . 
- I 'll be right back . - Jo , the ISS only has solar power for light and life support . 
You have one and a half minutes . 
Night 's coming . You won 't be able to pressurize . 
I just need to go and get something . I will make it in time . 
Jo , when night comes , you 'll only have oxygen in Soyuz 1 . 
I know . 
- Jo . 
- Tell Alice I 'm taking her necklace . 
- Jo , 20 seconds . 
Mamma loves her . It means I 'll be okay . 
I 'm coming back to her and Daddy . 
Promise to pass that on . Ten , nine ... - Promise to tell her . - Eight , seven , six ... Sergei , do you promise ? 
If you don 't promise , I 'm just gonna sit here and sulk . 
- We 'll pass it on . 
- Thanks . 
So , this is the procedure every orbit : 45 minutes in the light , 45 minutes in the dark . 
Going out of comms . Back in daylight in forty ... 
For the record , and I know how historically unlikely it is , this is my rendering of what hit the solar stack . 
Female corpse in USSR flight suit . 
Should we go find Mummy , Alice ? 
Oh , my baby . 
Good morning , Station . Morning , Jo . Good morning , Sergei . 
- You 're always so cheerful . 
- Thank you , Jo . 
We have approximately 17 hours , 49 minutes . 
Let 's go find those batteries . 
Let 's do it . I wanna get home . 
The batteries weren 't built to move , but they should be accessible . Understood . 
It 's gonna take longer than we thought . 
SKD in minus 20 . 
Firing thruster in five , four , three , two , one . Separation complete . 
Irena , you 're in charge of this goddamn evacuation . 
I sent you a plan . 
I want Ericsson to bring back the CAL . 
Henry , I told them to leave your machine . 
Why on God 's earth would you do that ? 
For all I know , it caused the accident . 
Irena , there is something contained in the six seconds that it was running that can make a difference to everything . 
To you , to me , my brother . 
It worked . We need it back . 
We will not get another chance . 
Send the retrieval plan , please . 
Soyuz 2 , confirm deorbit parameters . 
Confirmed . Entry into atmosphere . 
Capsule has re-entered atmosphere . 
Send the CAL retrieval plan . 
Yeah ? Getting off the plane as we speak . 
Heading straight to mission control . What 's her status ? 
All right . Yeah . Bye . 
She 's about to hit nightfall . If we hurry , you can speak to her . 
- Good . - Yeah ? 
Cinch all your straps down tight while you are under G. 
Try to keep your airways open by holding your head back . 
Radio break off . 
TsUP , do you copy ? 
We hear you , Ilya . Loud and clear . 
Good to hear your voices . 
Soyuz 2 deploys parachute , entering controlled landing . 
Jo . I have good news . That 's a successful landing of Soyuz 2 . 
Copy . Great . 
Jo , we are sending some schematics . 
RPL requests that you retrieve one of their experiments . 
- Which experiment ? 
- CAL data core in Destiny . 
Don 't know it . Not sure I 'll have time . 
It 's a NASA experiment . Don 't jeopardize your safety . 
Is my family there ? 
They 're on their way . 
- Ten minutes to nightfall . - Copy . 
I know you and Mummy were having problems . 
But I still want you to be friends whatever happens . 
Your family are in the building and coming to speak to you . 
I 'd love to speak to them too . 
Wonderful . We are setting that up . 
Copy . 
Let 's get this battery done before nightfall . Let 's do it . 
Your family are walking in now . Copy ... Station , this is TsUP . 
TsUP , this is Station , come in . 
TsUP , this is Station , come in . 
What 's happening ? Daddy , what 's happening ? 
Hello , this is Station . Is my family there ? 
I 'm gonna go ask them what happened . You stay here for a second , okay ? 
Excuse me ? Hello ? Excuse me ? 
What 's happening ? 
Please respond . 
Alice . Come back . Alice ! 
Wha ... Mamma ! 
Where have you been ?
