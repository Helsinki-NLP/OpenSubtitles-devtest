- Hello . 
- Sir . 
Kim Myeong-sik is dead . 
What ? 
Kim Myeong-sik is dead ? 
Then this ... 
I just checked . 
He 's dead . 
Kim Myeong-sik is dead . 
Kim Myeong-sik ...

That last case ... won 't happen . It 's because I 'm in here . 
He 's been hiding in the detention center ... to protect himself . 
DETECTIVE SEO JAE-HEE 
The number you have called cannot be reached . 
Why are you trembling ? 
Are you trembling because you were lying ? 
Are you sure she will be okay after this ? 
Please give the scalpel to me . 
Give me that . 
The surgery will begin soon . 
Doctor , I got blood type 1.2 . 
The surgery will begin . 
Give me the scalpel . 
Please take good care of her . 
Could you leave the room now ? 
- What ? 
- You can wait outside now . 
She 's right . Please wait outside , sir . 
Okay . 
Please take good care of Potato . 
EP15 . LAST WITNESS 
Doctor , I don 't think he dropped the dog . 
Focus on the surgery for now . 
Her organs are severely ruptured . 
Did you beat Potato ? 
Well , to be honest , I lost Potato accidentally when we were taking a walk last night . 
I finally found her today . But she was in that condition . 
Potato has bad separation anxiety disorder so I guess she barked all day when I was out for work . 
My neighbors complained a lot that she was loud . 
- You are saying a neighbor found Potato ... and beat her with something heavy ? Something heavy ? 
Yes . You end up like this if you 're beaten with something heavy . 
How 's Potato ? 
Did the surgery go well ? 
She is over the worst of it . But we have to see . 
It 's a miracle that she 's alive . 
It 's all my fault . I should 've kept a good hold on her leash . 
I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you the truth from the beginning . 
I was afraid you 'd see me as a lousy guardian . 
Baek-ryeon ! Baek-ryeon ! 
- Did something happen ? 
- There was an emergency surgery just now . 
I think she 's in shock after seeing the dog 's condition . 
The owner said he dropped the dog by mistake . But it looked like he hit her with something heavy to kill her . 
What ? 
What kind of a person would do that ? 
Baek-ryeon ! 
You found a red notebook at Kim Myeong-sik 's desk ? 
That means Myeong-sik is ... 
He isn 't the culprit . 
- You said you found a red notebook though . 
- He was the target , not the culprit . 
Kim Myeong-sik is dead . 
He 's dead ? 
No , the culprit was targeting women . How did he ... 
The last one , jealousy , was meant for Kim Myeong-sik . 
That 's why we need to get him soon . 
We need to go somewhere together . 
Kim , arrested for the murder of the Inwangsan Mountain missing woman , died in a detention center today . 
The culprit committed suicide ? 
- He 's probably not the culprit . 
- After being recently accused of killing his other mistress , Ms. Song , 
- he is presumed to have killed himself . 
- I don 't feel good about this . 
The police said they would be open to all possibilities as they investigate . 
According to Ms. Park So-yeong 's husband , a teenage boy was living in the semi-basement at that time . But he was too young , so people didn 't think it was him . So they dismissed him as a suspect .

Chief , is it true that Kim killed himself ? 
- Did he kill Ms. Song ? - Sir , did ... 
Are you sure he killed Go Eun-seo ? 
Chief , please answer . 
- Chief . 
- Please answer . 
JEALOUSY 
It 's driving me crazy . 
The last victim was a man . 
It means there was a change in the state of mind . 
Pyomyung Group 's finance team where Kim and Song worked . The detention center where Kim died . And ... 
I 'll search all the semi-basements in Jongseo-gu . 
Please support me with the search team . 
Hurry up and get him . 
We 'll search these four districts . 
Sang-hyuk , Detective Kim , and I will take charge of District One . 
And Detective Shin will be in charge of District Four . 
- Yes , sir . 
- Hurry up . 
Group One , stand in front of Group Two . You can follow them . 
- Group One , this way . 
Hurry . 
All right . 
You can check this one . 
The rest of you can follow me . 
- You two , go downstairs . 
- Yes , sir . 
Excuse me , is anyone here ? Yes . 
- Who are you ? 
- We 're the police . Please cooperate with us . 
Can we see the semi-basement ? This is it . 
- Does anyone live here ? 
- Nobody lives here . 
Did the red notebook look like this ? 
Yes . It was this . It said " jealousy " right here . 
I see . 
I drank too much that night . 
It doesn 't make sense . 
CHEON DONG-GU 
What the heck ? 
Hello ? 
I run the restaurant . But Mr. Cheon Dong-gu here is the actual owner . 
The employees don 't really know about him , so they made a mistake . 
Please don 't get him wrong . Okay . 
Today 's meal is already paid for . 
Have a good time . 
You didn 't have to make him explain . 
If he had not explained , you 'll think that all the things I said until now were lies too . 
The things you 've said ? 
I said I 'll only be interested in you from now on . 
I said you were my hobby . I said you were prettier than Kim Tae-hee . 
I meant all of those . 
What made you fall for me ? 
- What made me fall for you ? 
- What made you fall in love with me ? 
During the 500 years I 've been stuck on this earth , all human women have been cold to me . 
It hurt . 
But it was my first time . You were the first human woman who listened to me . 
We don 't judge people by their looks . 
Put them on . 
You 're the first human woman who looked into my eyes warmly . 
My lips . 
- Are you okay ? 
- You didn 't treat them like a bug . 
You 're a cool human woman who treated me without prejudice . 
That 's who you are , Do-ra . 
Let me ask just one more question . Are you really a fairy ? 
You saw me at the playground that day . 
I 'm sure you remember . 
- I saved you . 
- So that was really you ? 
I was here when you went to the restroom too . 
You were here ? 
I saw you quietly walking out with the bill . 
I was impressed once again to see how elegantly you handled it . 
I almost cursed . 
I 'm glad I didn 't . 
There were so many things I wanted to do with you . 
I wanted to take you out on a date , get married , and have a Maldives in the mojito . 
I wanted to go on a honeymoon with you . I wanted to have a honeymoon baby and live happily ever after together with you . 
You went too far . 
You didn 't even ask me how I felt about it . 
And now I can 't . 
What are you talking about ? 
Is it a one-man show ? 
I 'm leaving soon . 
To up there . 
Up there ? 
These wings are telling me that it 's almost time . 
I really don 't get this guy . 
Thank you for your help . 
All right , detectives . Bye . 
Yes , thank you . 
This was the last semi-basement in Jongseo-gu . 
I 'm sure his place is around here somewhere . 
Maybe it 's not a semi-basement . 
This house isn 't on the housing status map . 
Excuse me . We 're the police . 
Anyone there ? 
- Who are you ? 
- Hello , sir . 
We 're from Jongseo Police Station . 
What 's wrong ? 
I want to ask you something . 
There 's a connection between the missing and murder cases that happened in Jongseo-gu ? 
Yes , there is . 
Ms. Go who went missing in Inwangsan Mountain . Ms. Song who worked in a finance team of a large corporation . And Mr. Kim who was accused of murdering these two women . 
This is the notebook . 
Have you ever heard of Seven Sins for Women ? 
Aren 't they seven things that were considered to be crimes committed by women during the Joseon Dynasty ? 
Right . Three of the seven sins were written on the red notebooks . 
Adultery , disease , and jealousy . 
So the culprit gave them this notebook ? 
Yes , according to what the police have collected as evidence . 
And there 's something new we found out as we covered this . 
The rest of the four happened already . Gossip , disobedience , inability to bear a male heir , and theft . 
All those happened in Jongseo-gu , 1993 . 
Song , a missing victim of the Polka Dot High School Girls case in 1993 , received one of the red notebooks that said " theft . " 
The police found out that there were red notebooks that said gossip , disobedience , and inability to bear a male heir in previous missing cases during the recent police investigation . 
I see . 
The culprit killed that many people ? 
Ms. Oh , take some time off and stay home with Sang-hyuk . 
Is it because I 'm the last witness ? 
I 'm sorry . 
This wouldn 't have happened if I caught him sooner . 
You will get him . 
I can read people 's eyes . 
I see determination in your eyes . 
You 're determined to catch the bad guy no matter what . 
That 's why I believe that you will get him , no matter what . 
I am going to trust you and live my life , Detective Seo . 
I won 't hide . 
Ms. Oh . 
Hang in there . 
Hang in there and get him . 
Thank you for believing in me . 
Don 't come out until I pick you up tomorrow . Okay ? 
I won 't step out until the sun rises tomorrow morning . 
Baek-ryeon , you are a good girl . 
Get home safely . 
Go in . 
By the way ... 
Never mind . 
See you tomorrow . 
Bye . 
What ? 
Lead ? You want me to shoot you with a lead arrow ? 
Do you mean that scary lead arrow that makes you hate something at first sight ? 
You 're talking about that scary thing ? 
- Yes . Shoot me with that . 
- No ! I don 't want to . 
- You will die if you get shot with that . - It 's the only way to end everything . 
No ! 
You don 't know what will happen when you touch it . 
I don 't want to . 
I can 't . I won 't do it . 
I 'll shoot it . 
If that is the only way to bring you back to your senses . 
I wonder what would have happened ... if I shot him right ? 
You can shoot him again . 
Properly . 
Regrets won 't change anything . 
You are right . 
Everyone gets a second chance . 
I 've been meaning to ask you this . 
- How old are you ? 
- I 'm nine . 
Which apartment unit ? 
It 's 501 . Two floors down from yours . 
Really ? 
I didn 't know you lived two floors down from mine . 
Are you going home ? 
It 's 9 : 00 p.m. 
I have to brush my teeth and go to bed . 
I 'll visit you soon . Anytime . 
Should I ... shoot it again ? 
Sang-hyuk ! 
There are guys like that . It 's as if someone 's helping him . 
After you get the culprit , you 'll see they 're in the evidence and security camera footage we reviewed . 
But strangely , we missed it during the investigation . 
It 's as if someone from above helped the culprit . 
We 've checked all semi-basements in Jongseo-gu . 
There aren 't any suspicious ones . 
Sir , why don 't we wrap it up ? 
I don 't think there 's anything . 
Let 's make one more round . What ? 
One more time ? 
There are some houses that aren 't on the map . We have to check one more time . 
My goodness . 
Let 's go and check one more time . Okay . 
Hurry up and come . 
One thing I don 't know ? 
Yes . He said if you find out you may end up doing it depending on the situation . 
- What 's that ? 
- I don 't know . 
Ask Dong-pal . 
I don 't know if he 's going to tell you . 
Are you kidding me ? 
By the way , why do you think the last witness to the murderer is Baek-ryeon of all people ? 
Why do you think Lee Seon is in charge of the investigation of all people ? 
Of all things , he 's someone who killed Lee So-hee 500 years ago . 
He didn 't kill her . She was just dead . 
She killed herself . 
What ? 
She killed herself ? 
She was told that she had to be reborn to meet me again . 
Who told her that ? 
- A kid . 
- A kid ? 
How old is the kid ? 
I don 't know that . 
That 's strange . 
When I said I was worried about something , the kid from Unit 501 told me a simple solution . He said everyone has a second chance . 
Come to think of it , he also said something cool to me before . 
What do you think you need the most when you are in love ? 
He said it 's courage . 
What is love ? 
Then why do you ask ? 
I might have to do it soon . 
Which unit does that kid live in again ? 
Why ? Are you going to ask for advice , too ? 
Who is it ? 
My goodness . 
Look who 's here . 
You two are the good-looking sweethearts from Unit 701 . 
Sweethearts ? 
Are you sure about that ? 
I call all handsome men " sweetheart . " 
I see . 
By the way , what brings you two here at this late hour ? 
I 'm really sorry to bother you at night . 
Madame , do you happen to have ... What ? 
" Madame " ? 
Don 't call her that . 
Ma 'am . You have a nine-year-old kid , right ? 
A son , right ? 
Hey , people usually have kids once they 're married . 
And you call people ma 'am when they have a kid ! 
That 's not what we meant , ma 'am ... Madame ? 
Missus . Right . Missus . 
Isn 't a nine-year-old boy who 's about this tall your son ? 
- Why you little ! 
- Oh , gosh ! 
I 'm not even married yet ! 
Watch what you say . 
I don 't even have a son ! Why are you looking for a boy here ? 
How dare you insult me at this hour ! 
You two are ugly . 
We 're sorry , miss ! Miss ! 
Get lost , you * * * * ! 
I don 't think it 's here . 
He said he lives in Unit 501 earlier though . 
Where are you going ? 
Are you that kid ? The one who appeared before Lee So-hee 500 years ago ? 
I appeared before her because she prayed a thousand times . 
Why did you tell her to die and be born again ? 
For those two chances to meet you . 
I 'm about to go through the last metamorphosis . 
What do you mean by a chance ? 
Why would you do this now ? 
Don 't hide behind excuses . 
She prayed a thousand times just to meet you . 
Please let me meet him . 
Please allow me to meet him . 
Please allow me to meet him . 
And she died and was born again just to meet you . 
While Baek-ryeon was endlessly trying hard for those two chances , what did you do ? 
You had your chances too . 
For your second chance , think of the thing you didn 't do when you had your first chance . 
- The thing that I didn 't do ? 
- God will give you one more chance . 
Wait ! 
Everyone gets a second chance . 
You can shoot him again . 
Properly . 
Tell me . What is that one thing that I can do ? 
I can 't tell you . 
What will I do depending on the situation ? 
- I don 't want to lose you . 
- I 'm not asking you for a favor right now . 
So tell me . 
Answer me . 
Tell me what I can do . 
You will regret it . 
- I 'll decide after listening to you . 
- I will regret it . I will regret that I shared the secret today . 
It 's where the metamorphosis happens . 
The core of your heart and wings and the outer pores of the cocoon . There is a thin transparent tube that connects the three organs as one . It 's as thin as hair . 
That 's the vital spot for metamorphosis . 
A vital spot ? 
The critical point where it makes the wings transparent . 
If an arrow goes through that , your metamorphosis will stop . 
That 's how you can wake up and wait for the next metamorphosis . 
Hey . If you knew a method like that , - why didn 't you tell him earlier ? 
- The problem is when the arrow misses it . 
What do you think the chances are for an arrow to pass through the vital spot ? 
Let 's make another round there . 
- We 'll go this way . 
- Okay . 
I 'm home . 
In 1993 , the Polka Dot High School Girls case shocked the whole country . 
What are you watching so seriously ? 
The witnesses who testified about the girls ' whereabouts all died for unknown reasons . 
The last witness , who testified that he saw a suspicious man at a rice paddy field where Yoo Jeong-ah 's clothes were found , also died . 
- So he 's a serial killer ? 
- Who is the culprit ? 
Did he really kill all the witnesses ? 
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY 
Sir , someone is here to see you . 
Who ? 
Long time no see , sir . 
It was Yoo Jeong-ah . 
I want to hear that voice again . 
You want to hear the voice ? 
Yes . 
We can get the culprit then , right ? 
That man . 
SUSPECT CAUGHT ON CAMERA NEAR INWANGSAN MOUNTAIN 
You are going back to December 1993 in Sungin-dong . 
Where are you right now ? 
I 'm off to school ! 
Jeong-ah ! Don 't forget your lunch box . 
I forgot it again . I 'll be back . 
Have fun at school . 
Da-hee ! 
- Wait for me . 
- Hurry up . 
By the way , I lost my polka dot coat . 
- Your polka dot coat ? 
- Yes . 
I guess someone took it during PE class . 
I cried because I was so upset . 
Let 's go . 
Ta-da ! 
- Isn 't it pretty ? - I love it . 
Are you that happy ? 
Can you see the culprit 's face ? 
I can 't see his face because it 's too dark . 
- Are you a good girl or not ? - I 'm a good girl . 
I 'll be a good girl . 
Please don 't kill me . 
You 're lying . 
You 're lying . 
You 're lying . 
I wanted to be honest . Because you 're the first human woman who treated me like a human being . Goodness . Did you wait a long time ? 
I 'm on time , though . 
I guess it 's not happening today . You showed up . 
Right , I guess not . 
- Then let 's go on a date today . - Sure . 
Let 's do that . 
Wait . 
Do what ? 
You don 't know what a date is ? 
You mean that thing that a human man and a human woman do ? That lovey-dovey and sweet thing ? 
You said you wanted to do a lot of things with me . 
You wanted to go on a date , get married , and have " a Maldives in the mojito " . 
But your wings are telling you it 's almost time , so you can 't go that far . 
Just go on a date with me today . 
If your wings are still okay , we 'll go on another date tomorrow . 
What ? 
Tomorrow , too ? 
Yes . 
Not as a fairy and a human . As a man and a woman . 
I 've never done this before . 
Try this . 
- Isn 't it good ? 
- Yes . 
- A cotton candy ! 
- It 's white . 
Gentle gaze . 
Here , try this . 
Okay . 
- Gentle gaze . 
- One . 
Gentle gaze . Roar . PHOTO PICKUP 
- Shall we go ? 
- Yes . 
No . 
I want the whole space . 
Okay . I 'll be there soon . 
Okay . 
Are you going somewhere ? 
There 's a place we need to go together . 
Where ? 
Welcome ! 
- Mr. Park . 
- It 's been a while ! 
Come in . I prepared everything you asked for . 
Do you like it ? 
Mr. Park , you never disappoint me . 
Do-ra , this is it . 
Love is fearless . 
Love is reckless . 
But because of that ... you become a part of each other ... or become everything . 
You may be weak for yourself , but you can be strong for the other . 
That is why ... miracles are made . 
Miracles began with love . 
I underestimated myself . 
You 're getting on my nerves again . 
You finally showed up . 
Hello , sir . 
Ms. Oh Baek-ryeon dropped by the hypnosis room yesterday . 
She did ? 
Why did she go there all of a sudden ? 
MS. OH BAEK-RYEON 
That fate you created was bound to be broken if it was for someone with a strong will . 
I finally realized why you 've been warning me . 
Lee So-hee broke the red thread of fate to come and meet me . She was building her time . Meanwhile , you made me spend time being scared ... because we were going to meet in this lifetime . 
I 'm a variable that 's not affected by your threads of fate . 
I should have run faster . Then our first chance would have been different . 
Have you forgotten ? 
You will go through metamorphosis soon . No . 
I will refuse it . 
There is no more metamorphosis in my plans . 
I learned something during my hypnosis testimony . 
- I know it 's hard to believe , but I am ... 
- I believe you . 
I believe you too , Ms. Oh . 
I heard from Lieutenant Lee that you are Yoo Jeong-ah , the missing girl from the 1993 Polka Dot High School Girls case . 
That 's when I heard the culprit 's voice . 
So I have one last testimony to make . Go ahead . 
I heard the same voice recently . 
Wait . This place isn 't marked . 
I 'll check here first . Okay . 
That court lady has her own red thread of fate . 
Lee So-hee broke that red thread of fate already . 
While she was building her time with you , the time to reattach the broken thread was built too . 
- I 'll be back after a call . 
- Okay . 
It 's tonight . What wasn 't fulfilled that night . 
What wasn 't fulfilled ? 
Yes , Detective Myung . 
Sir , I found him . 
GOSSIP - DISOBEDIENCE 
Who is it ? 
It was that guy . 
MY MAN 
Yes , Sang-hyuk . 
Where are you ? 
Well , I am ... 
Where are you ? 
I 'm at the police station . 
I was going to tell you , but I didn 't want you to worry . 
Get out of there right now . 
I came out to go home now . I 'm in Detective Seo 's car . 
Whose car ? 
Get out of the car . 
Get out ! 
MY WOMAN 
Sang-hyuk , what 's wrong ? 
Hello ? Hello ? 
Hello ? Sang-hyuk . 
Sang-hyuk ! 
The court lady should have died for the prince that night .
