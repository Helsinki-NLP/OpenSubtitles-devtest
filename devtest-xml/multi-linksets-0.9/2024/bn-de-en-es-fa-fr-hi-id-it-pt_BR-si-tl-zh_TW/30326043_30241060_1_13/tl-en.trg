He was a short guy . 
So why did he ... 
That last case ... won 't happen . 
Because I 'm in here . 
He knows about the Seven Sins for Women . 
What could he have meant ? 
An accomplice . 
He 's the accomplice . The short guy Ms. Oh saw at the parking lot . 
I 'm sorry . 
That jerk who was seen at the convenience store . 
He 's an accomplice , but Kim Myeong-sik made a confession . 
Is he trying to take all the blame ? 
So why ? 
Jealousy . 
If it 's for that last one ... 
For the last one remaining ... 
I 'll get going first . 
Where are you going ? 
This place is ... 
It 's this neighborhood ? 
Yoo Jeong-ah and Song Da-hee , the fourth victims , used to live here ? 
Yes . 
This is where Ms. Yoo Jeong-ah used to live . 
My goodness . 
- My gosh . - Here . 
I called a cab , so it 'll be here soon . 
My goodness . I hope it comes soon . 
The number you have dialed ... 
Ah-rom . 
Hang in there . My goodness . 
My poor baby . 
- It will be okay . - There , there . 
The test shows that both her liver and kidney are fine . 
Most importantly , she doesn 't have a heartworm infection . 
So don 't worry . 
Does that mean it 's okay for me to raise her ? 
Yes , thank goodness . 
We don 't know what kind of environment stray dogs are exposed to . It looks like she 's fine based on this simple blood test . But keep her isolated and monitor her for about a week just in case . Considering the latent period . Okay . 
But what happened ? 
It was that day . The day Eun-seo 's body was found . 
It rained a lot that day . 
She was whimpering in front of my place , drenched in the rain . I just saw her then . 
It felt like Eun-seo had shown up . 
That 's why I named her Potato . 
Eun-seo liked everything made with potatoes . 
I guess it 's meant to be . 
Thank you . You helped me find Eun-seo 's body , at the very least . 
You should visit with Potato from time to time . 
There 's so much I don 't know . 
Please give me guidance . 
All right . 
This way , please . 
- Yes . Come on . - Ah-rom . 
Hang in there . 
- It 's here . - Okay . 
Okay . 
Detective Yeo . Is everything okay ? Sir . 
Excuse me ! Excuse me ! 
Our dog just swallowed a peach seed . 
A poster ? 
What are you talking about ? 
It lists seven things children shouldn 't do . We found a Seven Sins for Children poster . I sent a photo . 
Hold on . 
SEVEN SINS CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT 
Where did you find this ? 
Angel Orphanage in Changsin-dong . It 's where Ms. Oh grew up . 
She 'll go into surgery right away . 
So don 't worry . 
Thank you . 
I got it . 
Luckily , I removed it before it went down to the intestine . 
This small thing went into her stomach and gave her such a hard time . 
You must have been scared . 
I guess this is your first time at our clinic . 
It 's actually our first time at an animal clinic . Oh , really ? 
The dog looked pretty old . 
A few days ago , I found her whimpering at our front gate . 
So we just took her in , not knowing what we 'd gotten ourselves into . 
My goodness . Thank you . 
- How did it go ? - It went all right . 
We were in such a rush that we didn 't thank you properly . 
- Please check on Ah-rom . - Sure . 
I heard you brought them to our hospital . 
Yes . Luckily , it was nearby . 
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae ? 
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae ? 
Don 't be ridiculous . 
He went missing 28 years ago . 
Even if he 's alive , he can 't be that young . 
I 'm sorry . My wife thought you were someone else for a second . 
Maybe he 's the detective 's son ? 
Detective Cheon wasn 't married . 
Maybe he 's his secret son . 
Or he 's someone who can 't reveal who he really is . 
Doctor , Ah-rom 's awake . 
She is ? 
Shall we see her together ? Okay . 
EP13 . CAUSE AND EFFECT 
Ah-rom . Mommy 's sorry . I shouldn 't have left the peach seed there . 
First-time dog owners often make mistakes . 
It 's just like raising a kid . 
I left things everywhere when I was raising Jeong-ah too . So we often had to go to the emergency room . 
It was Jeong-ah 's birthday when we first met Ah-rom . 
Jeong-ah 's your daughter ? Yes . 
She went missing 29 years ago . 
I thought Ah-rom could be our daughter . 
That 's why I named her Ah-rom . 
My daughter loved the cartoon , Demetan Croaker , The Boy Frog . 
She always tended to do the opposite of what she was told . 
After my daughter went missing on a snowy night 29 years ago , I couldn 't do anything for a while . 
I couldn 't smile or eat for a while . Because I felt so guilty . 
I didn 't even know where my daughter was . So how could I smile ? 
How could I eat ? 
Thank you . Thank you for saving her . 
She will be fine in two to three days . 
You can take her home then . 
- Thank you . - Yes , thank you . 
You should have greeted them properly . 
You haven 't seen them in a while but you treated them like strangers . 
Don 't aliens have any manners ? 
- Aliens ? - Yes . 
You 're an alien . 
An alien . Me ? 
Tell me the truth if you don 't want me to get the wrong idea . 
Why should I do that ? For whose sake ? 
I have a favorite saying from Earth . 
" He that would eat the fruit must climb the tree . " 
A " saying from Earth " ? All right . 
I have a favorite saying too . 
" Don 't overplay your hand . " 
Hey , were you crying ? 
Well ... 
It 's because we were telling her about our daughter . 
Honey , let 's get going . 
The doctor should rest too . 
Thank you so much for today . 
Don 't mention it . 
We 'll be back when Ah-rom is ready to go home . 
Please take good care of her . 
Don 't worry . Get home safely . 
Thank you . 
Take care . Goodness . Here . 
She cried last time too . Huh ? What are you talking about ? 
She cried in front of our place the other day too . Goodness . - Why did you cry ? 
- Who made you cry ? 
I 'm talking to her . 
What 's wrong with you two ? 
You showed up out of the blue and told me not to hang out with him because he 's an alien . And you ran to the hospital late at night and dragged me towards you , telling me to stay away from him . 
What 's wrong with you ? 
You 're both old enough to know better . 
- You 're older , aren 't you ? 
- Well ... 
You two should be friends . 
Friends ? 
I can 't be friends with a man whose identity is unclear , like this guy . 
I can 't be friends with someone who acts so childish . 
- What ? 
- " Don 't overplay your hand " ? 
- A cop shouldn 't threaten people . 
- Seriously . Knock it off ! 
That 's why I cried . 
They said she was a stray they found on their missing daughter 's birthday . 
I guess it was meant to be . 
By the way , I saw their house in my dream . 
Do you remember the place ? 
The neighborhood we went to with Detective Seo . 
It 's here . I don 't know how it happened . But she keeps showing up in my dreams . 
Actually , I went there by myself before . 
Thank you . 
Goodbye . 
I cried then , too . 
I choked up for some reason , and I was sad . 
Don 't you miss your parents ? 
My parents ? 
No . 
Why would I miss them when they abandoned me ? 
What would you do if they hadn 't abandoned you ? 
What if they actually missed you very much and searched for you desperately ? 
SEVEN SINS CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER COMMIT 
After Director Hong Ae-kyeong beat the kids , she made them write about what they did wrong in a red notebook . 
Doesn 't this mean that the culprit is one of the kids from the orphanage ? 
As you know , Kim Myeong-sik is not an orphan . 
Then why did he confess ? 
Maybe he 's trying to protect the accomplice . 
That short guy Ms. Oh and Ms. Ham saw . 
So why would he do that ? 
Why is he protecting his accomplice by going as far as confessing ? 
If he 's the same guy who was responsible for the 1993 Seven Sins for Women cases , then he has just this one case left . " Jealousy . " 
There is one witness left too . 
The last witness . 
OH BAEK-RYEON LAST SEEN WITH EUN-SEO 
Detective Cheon Yeong-jae ? 
Maybe he 's the detective 's son ? 
Detective Cheon wasn 't married . 
- This man is ... - He said that was his father . 
I told you to stop coming . And to stop bringing flowers . 
I can do whatever I want . 
Stop . I told you to stop . 
I told you to stop coming . And to stop bringing flowers . 
You should go inside . 
You should really go in now . 
The voices are ... 
JONGSEO POLICE STATION 
ANGEL ORPHANAGE 6 . 
NOT CLEAN 7 . COMPLAIN 
So , you 're going to reinvestigate ? 
There are things that still seem suspicious . 
If there 's an accomplice ... 
It has already been transferred to prosecution . 
The suspect even confessed that he did it . 
- But if there 's an accomplice ... - What if you don 't get the accomplice ? If you don 't get him after you stir things up ? 
Don 't go asking for trouble . 
There is no accomplice . 
You can eat now . 
Thank you . 
It 's been so long since we had a team dinner . 
- Is it good ? 
- We 're here to eat . We 're not here to just admire the meat . 
If that 's what the chief says , we should just wait . 
I was swayed by it too because it all made sense . 
If you think about it , it 's Sang-hyuk who 's trying to link things with the Seven Sins for Women . 
If you ignore the cases in 1993 and 1994 , this is just a missing case for Go Eun-seo and Song Jin-ah . 
The only common contact between them is Kim Myeong-sik . All the evidence points to Kim Myeong-sik . 
And he even confessed . 
What about the girl from the convenience store ? 
That 's a missing case that 's not related to these cases . 
We didn 't find a red notebook either . 
What about the witnesses , Ham Yeon-ja and Kim Tae-kwang ? 
What about Im Ye-won who we thought was the witness ? 
And Ms. Yoon So-jeong , the witness from the bus ? 
They 're all unrelated cases . 
Ham Yeon-ja died from a fire . Kim Tae-kwang was killed in a fall . 
Ye-won and So-jeong killed themselves because they had their own reasons . 
I guess you can say they 're separate cases , if you insist . 
Well , Kim Myeong-sik confessed . Let 's wait and see . 
The problem is his height . 
A short guy was also seen . 
Isn 't there an Omega-3 that doesn 't smell fishy ? 
There is . 
Zo In-Sung . 
It gets absorbed fast . 
What does he have that I don 't ? 
It has a less fishy smell . It 's smooth on the throat because it 's a small capsule . 
Consecutively , number one . Promega . Is there anything besides his height ? 
Until everyone 's blood circulation in Korea gets better . 
Healthy blood circulation , Promega . 
I don 't have time . I have no time . 
Dong-chil . I 'm going to ask you some questions now . Answer them properly . 
What is it ? 
What do I have to do first to get close to a woman ? 
Tell me the most effective way . 
I have no time . 
Eat . You should eat together first . 
Eat ? 
I said I don 't have time . 
But that 's how you begin . 
When it comes to a relationship between a man and a woman , you have to eat together first . 
Are you sure ? 
- I just have to eat with her ? - Yes . 
LOVE ROOM 
Mr. Park . 
It 's this room , sir . 
Cheon Dong-chil ! 
Dong-pal ! 
Do something ! 
- I 'm all tied up . - Hey , my neck is killing me . 
Damn it . I want to go to the bathroom . 
You don 't know what I 'm going through . 
You can just pee anywhere . But for me ... 
- Hey . - A chamber pot . 
I 'll figure something out . 
I got it . 
I hope you have a good time . 
Thank you for the meal . 
I guess you 're close to the owner . 
You must be a regular . 
This is my business . 
I run this place . 
You run this restaurant ? 
This is why he told me to eat with her . 
Yes . 
That 's right . 
MR. DONG-CHIL 
Yes , sir . Mr. Dong-gu is actually here ... 
Mr. Park ! Help me . 
What 's wrong ? 
- Mr. Park . - Sir . 
Dong-pal ! 
Don 't tell me that you ... 
Dong-chil . 
A chamber pot ? 
Sir . 
Luckily , the key was in Mr. Dong-gu 's room . 
I won 't let Dong-gu get away with this . 
He 's having dinner in the Love Room with a lady . 
- A woman ? 
- A female human ? 
- Dong-gu ? 
- Cheon Dong-gu ? 
Yes , he 's dining with a woman . 
- Just the two of them . - Then ... So he actually has a girl . 
We should hurry . 
These days , Dong-gu 's a ticking bomb too . 
This siraegi jeon is what we 're promoting this season . 
It 's delicious . 
- Plus , it 's unique . - I came up with the recipe . 
- You make the menu , too ? 
- I told you . This is my business . 
It must have been hard for you to run a restaurant of this size . 
How do you know that ? 
I don 't need to hear the full story to know that it probably wasn 't easy . 
It was really hard for me . 
It was my friends ' fault . 
I didn 't want to do it , but my friends forced me . 
I was just hanging on to the edge . That 's why all four of us got stuck here . 
I have wings . But I can 't even fly because the lead weighs down my wings . 
Wings ? 
I told you . I 'm a fairy . Right . 
You mean the wings that a fairy has ? 
You don 't believe me ? You don 't believe that I 'm a fairy ? 
That 's not important . 
What 's important is that you piqued my curiosity now . 
I don 't know what you mean . 
I want to know more about you . 
You keep telling me that you 're a fairy . 
You 're attractive . 
You have that unexpected charm . 
I 'll get going first . 
My wife 's going to kill me if I 'm home late again . 
You can 't die . Go home . - My mom told me to come home . - You 're still here ? Go home . 
- Yes . - Bye . 
- Bye . - Bye . 
- Bye . - Great job today . 
So ... - Did you see anything ? 
- I saw a lot . 
They were just so lovey-dovey . 
- Damn it . - I thought I 'd die of loneliness . 
Did you see him change ? 
He didn 't change . 
Why doesn 't he change ? 
I don 't know if Sang-hyuk 's an alien or not . But they 're in love . Why interfere with that ? 
This is so unlike you . Why are you going after a girl who doesn 't like you ? 
I don 't know either ! Before I know it , I 'm next to Baek-ryeon . 
Before I know it , I 'm worrying about Baek-ryeon . 
Maybe we knew each other in our past lives . 
My dream . It was in my dream . 
A sword dripping with blood . 
- You mean your nightmares ? 
- Yes . 
- That suddenly crossed my mind . - When ? 
When Sang-hyuk and Baek-ryeon were hugging . 
Did you secretly watch them hug ? 
- Secretly ? No . - You just happened to be there . 
You just happened to be there ? 
Well ... I felt the same rage that day . 
It was irrationally intense . 
Maybe you two were ill-fated in a past life . 
Remember Detective Park ? His heart pounded a lot whenever he saw Detective Go , so he had a tough time too . 
He saw his past life through hypnosis . He 's all okay now . 
Why don 't you go there too ? 
- Hypnosis ? 
- Yes . 
Your obsession may decrease after you see what was in your past life . 
It 's not an obsession ! 
Interest . 
JONGSEO BARBECUE RESTAURANT 
I 'm full . 
Get home safely . 
- Okay , bye . - Bye . 
- You 're going this way ? 
- Yes . 
Drive slowly ! 
Are you okay ? 
Yes , I 'm okay . 
- Dong-pal . - Dong-chil . 
- Finally ! 
- It 's back . 
FELL OFF A CLIFF AND SAW THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL 
That 's when I saw them . Your wings . 
I 'm done . 
Don 't they look like this ? 
How did you see them ? 
When I put a flower petal on top of my index finger and counted to three , I saw them . 
Three . 
That 's how I recognized you . 
Because you 're the man I 'm destined to be with . 
Q : WHAT DO YOU SEE ? A : FLOWERS . FLOWER POTS . 
Q : WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE ? A : ORIGAMI FROGS 
By the way , I saw their house in my dream . 
I choked up for some reason , and I was sad . 
You 're leaving work soon , right ? 
I 'll be there soon . 
You 're attractive . 
You have that unexpected charm . 
Do-ra ! 
Can 't you see me ? 
Do-ra ! 
Here 's your bill . 
Did the owner go somewhere ? 
- The owner ? - Mr. Cheon Dong-gu . 
Who 's Cheon Dong-gu ? 
This restaurant owner 's name is Mr. Park Seung-jun . 
No , it 's me . 
He 's just Mr. Park ! I 'm the real owner ! 
Do-ra ! 
Can 't you see me ? Do-ra ! 
TOTAL AMOUNT : 285,000 WON 
Your payment is complete . Thank you . 
No ! No ! 
This can 't be happening ! 
Do-ra . Do-ra ! 
Do-ra ! 
What happened ? 
Hey , you two . 
What are you doing ? 
- We 're back . - What happened ? 
Why did it stop ? 
You 're having the same nightmare . 
I see a sword dripping with blood every single time . 
One was a long sword , and the other one was a short sword . 
Were you scared when you saw that sword ? 
No , it wasn 't fear . 
It was rage . 
I was so angry that I wanted to kill . 
Now , breathe comfortably . 
One . 
Two . 
One . 
Two . 
Go to that place you saw in your dream . 
What do you see ? 
A court lady . 
She 's looking at a flower petal . 
Please . 
A court lady who 's smiling . 
If you can 't give me your heart , then you should die for me . 
I can 't die for you . 
The only person I will die for is ... 
- You 're Soon-yi 's owner , right ? 
- Yes . This way . 
Soon-yi . 
Hang in there . Please . 
I think it 's time for you to say goodbye . 
Soon-yi . 
Thank you for all the happy memories these past 19 years . 
Let 's meet each other again . 
Soon-yi ... 
I 'm sure she was happy to have a family who was sad in her last moments and remembers the time they spent together . 
You have someone like that too . 
Goodness , your drawing looks amazing . 
I got it . I got my love . 
That 's when I saw them . Your wings . 
Don 't they look like this ? 
I 'll be with you wherever it may be . 
What ? 
There is a way to change my fate ? 
It 's your turn now . 
Die for that fairy . 
That 's where a new bud will bloom . 
You smell nice . 
You smell like flowers . 
You smiled . I guess we both like frogs . 
I guess we both like frogs . 
" When I called his name , he came to me and became a flower . " 
You have two more people who are just like these flowers . 
I 'm off to school . 
That 's why you feel like you 've been here before . 
My goodness . Doctor Oh . 
Ah-rom has gotten a lot better . So I 've been meaning to visit you . 
What brings you here ? 
Well ... 
- She has a friend who lives around here . - I see . Is that so ? 
Have you eaten ? 
We were about to have dinner . Would you like to join us ? 
Come on in . 
Come in . 
Come on now . 
Let 's go in . 
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD YOO JEONG-AH 
Can 't you see the other girls ? Please ? Please ? 
You 're a kid . Stop saying such ridiculous things . 
You should eat now . 
I 'm not a kid . I 'm a grown woman . 
You may not know this , but I 'm very popular . 
It 's embarrassing for me to say this myself , but ... Lean closer . 
I 'm known as one of the top five most beautiful girls in Sungin Girls ' High School . 
I got it . We should eat now . 
Hurry up and eat . 
I have something else to tell you . 
Lean closer one more time . 
The top five most beautiful girls in Sungin Girls ' High ? 
No , it 's about something else . 
Okay . 
Hey , you can 't do this . 
You 're in trouble . You 're my man now , Superman . 
You didn 't come here to eat tteokbokki , right ? No . 
SEOUL RECORDS 
Kim Hyun-sik . 
Could you do a gift wrapping ? 
- A gift ? 
- Yes . 
Who are you giving it to ? 
To the man I 've been chasing after with everything I have . 
He 's a lucky guy . 
A pretty lady like you is after him . 
But he keeps saying no . 
I 'm so upset . 
I can 't believe I 'm laughing like this again . 
Goodness . I told you , it 's like Jeong-ah is back . 
I laughed a lot when she was around . 
- Goodness . Doctor , you 're crying again . - My gosh . 
I guess it 's because we keep talking about our daughter . 
No . 
- It 's because the food tastes so good . - You 're a crybaby . 
My daughter used to cry a lot , too . 
Let 's stop talking about her now . 
May I be Jeong-ah for you ? 
I 'll be Jeong-ah . 
Thank you . 
I love all the moments I was excited and happy because I met you . 
I love them all . 
The first time I saw you and all the times I spent with you since then . 
As wild grass , a wild flower , a bug , and a butterfly . 
After being reborn like that ... 
Even when I was 19 years old , and 29 years old as well . 
How did you ... 
Thank you for being by my side and in front of me . 
- Baek-ryeon . - I love you . 
No matter what you are .
