I love all the moments I was excited and happy because I met you . 
I love them all . 
The first time I saw you and all the times I spent with you since then . 
As wild grass , a wild flower , a bug and a butterfly . 
After being reborn like that ... 
Even when I was 19 years old , and 29 years old as well . 
- How did you ... - Thank you for being by my side and in front of me . 
- Baek-ryeon . 
- I love you . 
No matter what you are . 
So when you fell off the cliff ... 
I had killed myself . 
Why did you do that ? 
He said I had to be reborn to meet you again . 
He told me I 'd have two chances as a human . 
Who ? Who told you that ? 
It was a kid . A little boy . 
I think I saw his face . 
But if you keep changing like this , doesn 't it mean you 'll disappear soon ? 
It 's metamorphosis , right ? 
You remember ? 
When will it start ? 
And when will you come back once it starts ? 
Once it starts , it takes about - a week or so . - A week ? 
That 's not bad . 
You can go . Take as much time as you need . 
- Sometimes , it takes a month . 
- A month ? 
Some trips take a month . 
Now that I think about it , - it lasted a year once . - That 's too long . 
Actually , there was one that lasted two years too . 
I can just pretend that you went to the army for two years . 
Baek-ryeon . 
- There was one that lasted five years . 
- Five years ? 
Sometimes it took ten years . 
Ten years ? 
That 's ridiculous ! 
Even long-distance couples can see each other from time to time if they fly back and forth . 
People in the army can even make video calls these days . 
But I can 't even see you or talk to you once you go into metamorphosis . And you want me to wait ten years ? 
Are you serious ? 
Ten years ? 
I can 't wait that long . 
Listen , Baek-ryeon . 
The metamorphosis I 'm going through this time ... 
Why do you even go through it ? 
I explained it to you last time . 
Five hundred years ago , my wings ... 
Your baby face . It 's because of that , right ? 
It 's a necessary process to maintain a baby face , which is essential to a fairy . 
That 's what metamorphosis is . 
If that 's the case , reject it . 
Don 't go through with it . 
- Reject it ? 
- I didn 't tell you this before , but your baby face makes me very uncomfortable . 
You look too young . 
It would be perfect if you look just a little older . 
You can 't be 500 years old . You look too young . 
There are sheet masks and beauty devices that could prevent you from aging even if you don 't go through metamorphosis . 
Why don 't you use them and grow old with me in this lifetime ? 
You can go through it all at once when I die . 
I won 't care if you 'll be away for ten or a hundred years , because I 'd be dead by then . 
Okay ? 
- Well ... 
- What 's that face ? 
You don 't want that ? 
You can 't give up on looking young ? 
Just to meet you again , I became a weed , a fly , a moth and a dung beetle in a field of poop the past 500 years . 
But you can 't even give up your baby face . 
- Come on , Baek-ryeon . 
- Choose . Is it me or your face ? 
If I could choose , I would . 
- But ... 
- But what ? 
- I can 't do that . 
- You can 't ? 
- It 's because ... 
- I don 't want to hear it anymore . 
You 're so firm about it . 
- Baek-ryeon ... 
- We should call it a day now . 
I 've had enough of your bewitching face for today . 
- I need time to think . 
- But ... 
Baek-ryeon ! 
Did I roll around in cow and horse poop just to be treated like this ? 
I clearly thought too highly of him . 
I can 't believe he surprised me with a twist like this . 
Damn it ! 
- How could you do that ? 
- What do you mean ? 
- Come to your senses ! 
- Yes , come to your senses ! 
You both ruined the happiest moment of my life ! 
You 're a fairy and she 's a human . Wake up . 
Yes , it 's almost time for us to go . 
- It 's too late now . 
- You two dated all the women you want . 
But I just met her ! You couldn 't give me a break ? 
You ruined everything ! 
She was the first female human who said I was attractive ! 
She said you were attractive ? 
How ? 
She said I was unexpectedly charming ! 
But at that moment , I disappeared , leaving behind a bill for 285,000 won . 
- What is she going to think of me ? 
- She probably thinks you 're a jerk . 
Damn it . 
That was definitely unexpected . 
EP14 . JEALOUSY 
Am I going crazy ? 
Am I drunk ? 
I don 't get what the problem is . 
Maybe it needs something more . 
Like what ? 
I don 't know . 
You guys should figure it out . 
What did you say ? 
You brought us into this mess . 
Come out ! 
Samsin , come out right now ! 
I 'll burn down everything too ! 
Damn it . Damn it . 
I 'm going to burn these burdensome wings too ! 
I 'll go back to Do-ra right now ... 
My gosh , it 's hot ! 
That burns ! 
Hey ! Are you crazy ? 
You 'll never be able to burn your wings . It 's too hot for you . 
You 're ruthless . 
He 's such a ruthless guy . 
How did he endure this ? 
Do-ra ... I 'm sorry . 
It 's too hot . 
It 's just too hot . 
I can 't do this . 
RELIABLE POLICE , SAFE COUNTRY 
Chief , you know about Sang-hyuk . 
Who on earth is he ? 
I had killed myself . 
He said I had to be reborn to meet you again . 
He told me I 'd have two chances as a human . 
Who ? Who told you that ? 
It was a kid . A little boy . 
I wonder who that kid is . 
" Two chances as a human . " 
I 'm about to go through my last metamorphosis . 
What are the chances ? 
He looks like someone . 
He 's that crazy king ! Isn 't he ? 
Sang-hyuk , you 're Cupid . 
I guess they 're Cupids too . 
Is Ddaeng-chil one too ? 
I don 't see the dog today . 
Are you here to see Ddaeng-chil ? 
- When it 's this late ? 
- Of course not . 
I need to speak to him in private . 
Could you give us a minute ? 
How did he know ? 
Shouldn 't we run away ? 
You said he 's a cop . 
A cop wouldn 't have come at this hour to arrest a fairy . What for ? 
Maybe he wants to eat us ! 
We are just delicate and fragile fairies . 
Who said he 's attractive ? 
So you found out the truth . 
I told you it was just a matter of time . 
If you need help urgently in terms of my area of expertise , we can talk tomorrow morning . 
We need to sleep at night too . 
You know the woman in the photo , right ? 
I need to know who she is . From this man who was with her . 
Did you go to my old house ? 
I 'm sorry . I didn 't ask for your permission . 
Humans only ask other humans for permission . 
Who is this woman ? 
I don 't think I have to answer that . 
I 'll ask you again . 
Is she Baek-ryeon ? 
I need to know why I 'm in the middle of you two . 
You said you saw your past life . 
Then you should know . 
You weren 't in my past life . 
But the woman in my memory was with you . 
I need to know what happened . 
Five hundred years ago ... you killed me . 
I killed you ? 
Then how are you standing before me right now ? 
You saw it . You saw what I 'm capable of . 
And you want to know who that woman is ? 
I 'll tell you what . 
You tried to kill that woman as well 500 years ago . 
What ? 
You said that woman is in your memories . 
You should die for me . 
MY WOMAN 
Yes , Baek-ryeon . 
I 'm going to bed now . 
You 're not going to go into metamorphosis while I 'm asleep , right ? 
I won 't go through it tonight . 
Are you sure ? 
I 'm sure . Don 't worry . 
How can I believe you ? 
Call me as soon as you wake up tomorrow . Okay ? 
I will . 
Good night , my woman . 
What was that ? " My woman ? " 
" My woman . " 
You killed me 500 years ago . 
You tried to kill that woman as well 500 years ago . 
I also want to know why we met again . 
I 'm sure this was all his doing . 
Who ? 
Does he not exist in your memories ? 
Who is he talking about ? 
Don 't go ! 
MY MAN 
Please answer the phone . 
The number you have dialed cannot be reached ... 
Don 't tell me he 's gone . 
Yes , Baek-ryeon . 
Hello ? 
Hello ? Baek-ryeon ? 
Why did it take you so long to answer the phone ? 
- What ? 
- You said you 'd call me when you wake up . 
You promised . 
I just got out of the shower and was about to call you . 
You should have called me before you took a shower . Geez . 
I hate metamorphosis . It 's the worst ! 
What if you go through metamorphosis while I 'm working ? 
Promise me you won 't go through it . 
That 's not something I can promise . 
My gosh . 
Wait . 
Baek-ryeon . Geez . 
- Good morning . - Good morning . 
Detective Seo , you 're here . Hello . 
I was told that Alexandra needs a regular checkup . 
Has it been that long already ? 
Hello , Alexandra . 
How have you been ? 
Let me see if you got better . 
A major surgery can destabilize the level of inflammation for a while . 
But you took good care of her . Her results are much better . 
Her white blood cell and CRP levels are all okay . 
You are a good guardian . 
Alexandra must have done a lot of good deeds in her past life . 
She is lucky to have met you , Detective Seo . 
Why do you think we met again ? 
Why did I try to kill you back then ? 
I have to go now . 
Hold on a second . 
Come on . 
Detective Seo . 
Here . 
Apply it where you got hurt . 
You 're bound to get hurt as a detective . You need one of these effective ointments . 
I applied it on someone . It works right away . 
Do your best to wipe out all the bad guys today . Detective Seo . 
Jealousy . 
Some types of jealousy are great for relationships . 
I guess Dong-gu is not here today . 
You 're right . 
He usually comes half an hour early . 
Maybe he got a girlfriend . 
- The hamburger girl . - That must be it . 
They could be eating the set meals . 
I 'm so jealous . 
Let 's begin the class . 
Ms. Ahn . 
You 're prettier than Kim Tae-hee to me . 
Dong-gu . 
It helps you get interested in him or her again . 
On the other hand , there 's a type of jealousy that 's bad for relationships . You should never do this . 
The more you do it , the more obsessed you become . Obsession leads to destruction . 
I 'll save you , Chae-yeon . Stop the car ! 
- Go away ! 
- Stop the car ! 
Chae-yeon is mine . 
Don 't fight over me . 
No one can choose me . 
Stop the car right now ! 
This is an order . 
There 's something here . 
What 's that ? 
It 's on . 
Hey ! 
What are you doing in someone else 's car ? 
Everyone , get out . 
I know it 's a crappy car , but you can 't go into someone else 's car without permission . 
FORENSIC SERVICE 
My gosh . 
Please tell us what happened in detail . 
These kids were playing in the car . I told them to get out . 
And I came over here and I saw that the car trunk was open . 
When I opened it , I saw a dead body . 
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE 
Ms. Song was famous . 
LEE HYEON-JI 
She flirted with a guy in every division . One of them was Mr. Kim Myeong-sik . 
But after he was investigated by the police as a suspect of the famous Inwangsan Mountain missing woman 's case ... You are under arrest for the murder of Ms. Go Eun-seo . 
That 's when Ms. Song started to stay away from Mr. Kim . 
Ms. Song . 
AIN DRUG STORE 
It 's an STD . 
AIN DRUG STORE 
He gave her the notebook knowing that she had an STD , just like he gave Go Eun-seo the Adultery notebook . 
But don 't you think it 's strange ? 
Why ? What do you mean ? 
I just feel that it 's strange . 
It 's strange . 
Let 's go . 
Okay . 
DNA COMPARISON RESULT 
Your DNA was found on Song Jin-ah 's fingertips . 
DNA SAMPLES ARE FROM THE SAME INDIVIDUAL 
I only killed Go Eun-seo . 
I didn 't kill Ms. Song . 
The signs say she was strangled . 
Song Jin-ah fought back , and in the process , she scratched a part of your body and it was left as evidence . 
I told you not to see other men ! 
Who do you think you are ? 
I just flirted with you . That 's all . 
Stop acting like you 're my husband ! 
You killed her because you were mad that she had a change of heart . 
It ... 
It wasn 't me . 
I didn 't kill her ! 
Damn it ! 
I 'm sorry . 
Are you okay ? 
A red notebook was found inside Song Jin-ah 's studio . 
You did this , right ? 
DISEASE 
Did you do this ? 
How did you get this ? 
I want to stop . 
Officer ! 
I want to get out . 
Officer ! 
Officer ! 
I want to leave ! 
The body of a woman in her 30s who went missing ten days ago was found in a mountain in Oseong , Gyeonggi-do . 
Her body was found in the trunk of a car with an unidentified license plate . To find out the exact cause of death , National Forensic Service is performing an autopsy . 
Meanwhile , Song 's death is ... 
I 'm safe . 
It 's safe here . 
What do you think the problem is ? 
Have you ever missed any shots ? 
No , never . 
That 's not true . 
You missed this . 
Shoot it now . 
You 're right . I did miss a shot . 
I missed this shot . 
I think I missed a shot before too . 
You missed a shot too ? When ? 
BANG MYEONG-SOO DATING ACADEMY 
Yong-bok and Il-yong , tell me five things that are attractive about you . 
Il-yong , you can go first . 
Right . 
There 's no right or wrong . 
Tell me your charms . 
Try to think of your fifth charm . 
Have you thought about it ? 
What kind of charms do you have ? 
What 's the third one ? Is it the same as the first one ? 
Hold on . What 's the second one ? 
- Thank you . 
- Thank you . 
Yes , goodbye . 
Make sure you do your homework . 
- Okay . 
- Yes . 
- What 's this ? 
- What 's this ? 
Ms. Ahn , I think this is for you . 
MS. AHN DO-RA 
- Then this must be for you too . - Goodness . 
What ? 
He just left this ? 
I also want to know why we met again . 
I 'm sure this was all his doing . 
Who ? 
He said that the last case won 't happen . 
That 's why it 's Kim Myeong-sik ! 
He 's in the detention center . What can he do ? 
And the evidence is so clear . 
- Don 't you think it 's strange ? 
- What is it again ? 
The body was found right when we needed it . 
How come there 's evidence on the dead body ? 
We found Eun-seo 's body in the abandoned factory when he said he didn 't kill her . 
So that 's when he admitted that he killed Go Eun-seo . 
But he kept insisting that he didn 't kill Song Jin-ah . 
And then her dead body just showed up . 
Don 't you think it 's strange ? 
What do you think , sir ? 
Sir . 
What did you say ? 
Anyway , I still think the guy in black is suspicious .

What if he disappears while he 's waiting for me in the car ? 
What if it takes a hundred years for him to come back ?

How can he really disappear ?

Who did you go with to that place at this hour ? With who ? 
Superman ? 
You got it . 
Do I have to say more ? 
I 'm hanging up . 
Are you here alone ? 
Yes . 
But we should drink together . 
I think he 's so funny . 
What 's so funny about him ? 
He 's funny . 
Why don 't we go out and have another drink ? 
Should we ? 
Okay , let 's do that . 
I need to use the restroom first . 
- Over there . 
- Okay . 
See you . 
Me ? 
I 'm at the bar that we came to before . 
I just got a girl . 
I 'll be leaving soon . 
It 's just a one-night stand . 
I 'll talk to you later . 
Bye . 
Where 's the man who was here ? 
He ran away . 
- He ran away ? 
- Yes . 
- Why did he run away ? 
- By the way ... Here .

Why do they all leave me with the checks ? 
Did they lend me money or what ? 
They 're ridiculous . 
They must be so happy .

Okay .

Come on ! 
I have to fly .

Who are you ? 
That last case won 't happen . 
Because I 'm in here .
