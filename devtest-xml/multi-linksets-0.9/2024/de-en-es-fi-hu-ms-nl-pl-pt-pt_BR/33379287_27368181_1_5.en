Someone must have called her to go out there , didn 't they ? 
Tomorrow , 1 : 00 a.m. Bring the video that Kim Jaehee and your daughter have . 
I 'll send the address . 
Come alone . So , the last call came from Apgujeong . 
The phone was turned off as soon as the call ended . 
Why do you want to know where Yeseo 's phone is ? 
Just send me the location , okay ? 
Captain Kang . 
The Commissioner is looking for you right now . He wants you to give Noh Joonseo 's case to Major Crimes . 
You need to come here and sort this out ... 
Could you take care of Noh Joonseo 's case ? 
And keep checking Yeseo 's phone , in case it turns on again . 
I 'd appreciate it . 
Hey ! 
I guess Jaehee didn 't tell you about this place , did she ? 
Jaehee ? Do you know Jaehee ? 
In this business , you 'd be an idiot to not know who Jenny is . 
Not many girls go from rock bottom all the way to the top . 
" Jenny " ? 
Then , um , you must know where Jaehee is then , right ? 
How much do you know about Kim Jaehee ? What do you ... 
Worry about yourself . 
It doesn 't take much time to become like them . 
Jaehee saved my life . 
That 's why I 'm trying to help her . 
Because we 're friends . 
GANGNAM B-SIDE 
2 YEARS AGO 
That fucking bitch acts as if she 's a fucking angel . 
Hey , did you see her earlier ? 
Bitch doesn 't even get scared anymore . 
I fucking hate the way she looks at me . 
Where the hell is she ? Seriously , where did she go ? She 's probably crying somewhere like an idiot . 
- I saw her leaving earlier . 
- Who wants to find her ? 
- I do ! - Come on , let 's go . 
What are you doing ? 
Hey , grab her . 
Let me see . Where do you want it ? 
How about here ? Or maybe the left ? 
I think it 'll look pretty as fuck , you little bitch . 
You better not rat us out ... 
- Should I cut her ? Huh ? Yes ? 
I was wrong . 
I 'm so sorry ! 
Fucking answer me . 
Don 't just stand there like a fucking idiot ! 
I never asked for your help . 
Why did you do that ? 
Is it because you pity me ? 
No , I don 't have any pity for bitches like you . 
- Why not ? 
- Why do you think ? 
Because your normal parents made your life so good you can 't even fight back against bullies . 
Your weak ass ain 't got what it takes . Little princess . 
How can I become stronger then ? 
How ... How can I be like you ? 
Why don 't you call your rescuer ? 
Come on , bitch . I told you to call her . 
Apolo ... Apologize . 
The hell is this bitch saying ? 
Can you hear her ? 
I said , what the fuck are you saying ? 
I said apologize , you fucking bitch ! 
- Fuck ! - She 's fucking crazy ! 
- Go ahead . 
- Are you serious ? 
Fucking go ahead , I said ! Hey ! 
Fuck off . 
- Come on , I said fuck off . 
- Hey . Let 's go . 
Hey , Kang Yeseo . 
Put that down . 
Come on , put it down . 
Die ! You fucking bitch ! 
Hey . Hey ! Look at me . 
Listen . That bitch fell off the roof all on her own like a dumbass . 
And it 's just bad luck that we happened to be here . Got it ? I pushed her . I did . 
Hey . Hey , get ahold of yourself , come on . 
- Shit . Snap out of it ! 
And this . She did this too , all right ? 
Yeseo , there 's no need to feel guilty , it 's not your fault . 
Don 't say anything stupid . You hear me ? 
So , the last call came from Apgujeong . The phone was turned off as soon as the call ended . 
Why do you want to know where Yeseo 's phone is ? 
HANGIL CLEANING SERVICE 
" Deep-clean ? " 
Yeah , they said the people from the company called Hangil Cleaning Service come once a month for cleaning . 
I tried calling them , but it 's not a working number . 
If you get caught , the media and prosecution will be all over you . You can 't be here . Go now ! I 'll do whatever it takes to protect Jaehee . Go , now . 
You have to protect Jaehee . 
We 'll observe how this progresses and follow up with you . 
- Get some rest . 
They took Jinyoung to a rehab center . Apparently her addiction is pretty severe . 
What about Mr. Yoon ? 
Yoon Gilho ? 
He 's gone missing again . 
Mr. Kang ... don 't tell Yeseo I 'm here , if that 's cool . 
Why not ? 
She 'll probably cry if she sees me like this . 
Jaehee . 
Where 's the video ? 
Uh , I don 't have it . 
They 're after you right now . They 're after you because of that video . 
You think I 'm stupid ? 
Keeping it would have made it too easy for those bastards . 
I gave it to someone . You gave it ... 
Who did you give it to ? Who has it ? 
Jaehee , you 're in serious danger because of that . 
I 'm trying to help you right now . Okay ? 
Could you get me some food first ? 
- Here . 
You 're gonna buy me anything I want ? 
Yeah ? 
- Do you even know ... 
- Captain , where are you ? 
Your wife just came to the station . 
Geez , man . 
- Did something really happen to Yeseo ? 
- At least give me ... 
Jesus . Is it related to Gangnam Trading Company ? 
Where is she right now ? 
Yeah . 
Oh , those fucking assholes . 
I 'll report her as missing and dispatch a team right away . 
We can start the search from the location we found earlier . 
No , if we move too hastily , Yeseo ... 
Yeseo could be in serious trouble . 
Tell my wife she needs to go home . Make up an excuse if you have to . 
Those bastards want something from me . 
All right . Let 's talk later . 
Are you ready to go ? 
Can you ring these up please ? 
- Can I eat this first ? 
- Yeah , sure . 
- I 'll heat this up , okay ? - Okay . 
Mr. Kang . 
Try to be good to Yeseo . 
Stop feeding her burgers everyday , you know ? 
What ? Come on , it 's not like I bought her burgers every day . 
That 'll be 28,500 won . 
Jaehee , you didn 't give that video ... you didn 't give it to Yeseo , right ? 
Jaehee ? 
I checked all the roads around the convenience store , but because of the rain , checking all the dash cams , too ... It will take at least a couple of days . 
DONGSEONG FERRY 
Leaves two nights from now . 
That 's the name of the boat . 
What are you doing ? 
Look , I barely managed to get this gig so just go away . 
There 's nothing you can do here now anyway . 
That bastard Noh Joonseo is dead , and Jaehee is safe at the hospital . 
I mean , come on . Doesn 't that mean it 's all fucking over ? 
Over ? Nothing 's over . 
What about Noh Joonseo 's crew , man ? 
You really think that bastard Noh Joonseo committed suicide ? 
What if you 're wrong ? 
What are you going to do then ? 
You said that the fucking cop promised he 'd protect Jaehee . 
It 's a chance for Jaehee to start a new life . 
Hey , there . Young lady ? 
Hello , I 'm in front of Unit 803 , and I just found a girl ... 
I told you to teach her a lesson , not ruin her face . 
What 's the matter with you , huh ? 
She hurt you , yeah ? 
If I find out you made a copy , you 'll be as good as dead . 
You know that , right ? 
Even if I say I didn 't , you won 't believe me anyway . 
Just fucking kill me . 
Come on . It 'd be a waste to just kill you . 
Get off me . 
You 've had a nice , cozy time with the boys in Gangnam . To celebrate the launch of the new server , I 'll make you the main event with full options . 
So why don 't we take this opportunity to really kick back and have a good time , huh ? What do you say ? 
What 's the word , Jaehee ? 
Okay ? 
Cover her scars , all right ? 
Yeseo . 
Yeseo . 
Are you okay , sweetheart ? 
It hurt so fucking bad . 
I guess it 's been a while . 
Did it really hurt ? 
I meant to only hit the parts that could be seen . 
How 's Yeseo ? 
Did she get away clean ? 
You didn 't beat her like me , did you ? 
You crazy psycho . 
Geez , what are you worried about her for ? 
Worry about yourself . 
Geez , Choi Suin . Quit nagging . 
She said you saved her , you know , so she had to do something for you too . 
That 's not true . 
She 's the one who saved me . 
Remember the backdoor exit we used to use ? 
I put some clothes and some cash there . 
I 'll try to stall , so hurry and get out . Go . 
And live with Gilho somewhere as far away as possible . 
Don 't you ever come back to Gangnam again . Okay ? 
If you let me go , they 'll fucking kill you . 
Fuck you . 
A bitch like me is built to survive , all right ? 
So stop with the bullshit and go while I let you . 
That 's pretty fucking moving , and I thank you for that . I 'm done running away . 
I should 've done this ages ago . 
I 've dragged it out too long . 
Suin , do me a favor , please ? 
YOON GILHO 
What are you doing ? 
Hop in . 
Give me a minute . 
I 'll do whatever it takes to protect Jaehee . 
Your call cannot be completed as dialed ...

Hi , everyone . 
You 're gonna have a good time with Jenny . 
Okay , guys ? Oh , yeah . I have four ideas ... 
GILHO ... for your nicknames . The first one is ... - Your call cannot ... 
- What the fuck , man ! 
All right , all right . 
I see you 're impatient . 
The Jenny Show is about to start . 
Those sick motherfuckers ... 
Where the hell is this ? 
What do you think ? 
Which one should I use ? 
This one ? 
Hmm ? 
YOU 'RE GREAT TODAY 
YOU 'RE MINE , JENNY 
I gave you fair warning , and you still didn 't fucking listen . 
Where 's Jaehee , you bastard ? 
You sent Kim Jaehee to us . 
We traded her for your daughter . 
Yeseo is such a pretty girl . 
Are you watching me , babe ? 
I said , are you watching me , you fucking bastards ? 
What the fuck is she doing ? 
Oh , Jesus . 
Get down from there ! 
Fuck , fuck , fuck . 
HARDER ! 
HYPE TODAY 
I get to decide my ending . I fucking decide . 
You 'll never get what you want ! 
You 'll never get what you fucking want . 
Fucking bastards . See you in hell . 
What the fuck . 
This fucking bitch . 
- Please stay back . 
- Is she breathing ? 
- Wait , are you sure ? - She 's not breathing . 
I don 't have any information ... 
- Please , for your own safety . 
Jaehee ! 
Jaehee ! 
Oh , my God , no ! 
Jaehee ! 
Fuck ! 
Jaehee . 
No ! 
Let go ! 
Let go of me ! 
Hey , it 's me . 
How are you ? 
I was going to call you , but ... you might 've changed my mind . 
Are you still mad at me ? 
You know , when I was harsh with you I did that on purpose , right ? 
I didn 't want you to stay miserable . 
I know how fucking petty you are . 
You know what ? 
That day , on the roof , you saved my life . 
You fucking bitch ! 
- Have you lost your fucking mind ? - You 're fucking crazy . 
Come on , come at me ! Go ahead . 
So don 't act like you 're weak . 
Fuck this . 
Let 's go . 
You 're stronger than I am . 
You 're born to be that bitch , you know . 
You 're the one who saved my life . 
I know this is so fucking cringey ... but I thought I should tell you this before I go . 
Thank you for that , Kang Yeseo .

THE LATE KIM JAEHEE 
You killed both Jaehee and me . 
This is on you , Dad . 
SUIN 
You doing all right ? 
I 'll be hanging out with Junghwa so she doesn 't get bored . 
Don 't get too happy that this annoying bitch is out of your hair . 
Thanks for everything , Minseok . 
Gilho . 
You make it clear to that bastard K that he better stick close to that motherfucking Mr. Choi . 
Let him know I 'm coming for him .

NOH JOONSEO 
MR. CHOI 
THIS IS PROSECUTOR MIN SEOJIN FROM SEOUL PROSECUTION 
I 'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT YOU , MR. CHOI HAKGU 
I 'M IMPRESSED THAT YOU FOUND ME 
SHALL WE MEET ? 
A bit shabby , isn 't it ? 
Not suitable for a prosecutor like you ? 
It may not look like much , but nearly every restaurant in Gangnam happens to owe some sort of debt to this store . 
I 'm not interested in history . 
What did you want to see me about ? 
You were the one who contacted me first , weren 't you ? 
You must have something in mind if you 've come here instead of preparing to be demoted to the role of small town investigator so what is it you 'd like to speak with me about ? 
Here 's what I have on Gangnam Trading Company and on you . 
If I go ahead and expose all this , Tak Juil 's corruption will be brought to light and so will his connection to you , Mr. Choi . 
Go ahead . 
Did you actually believe we wouldn 't be prepared for such a thing ? 
I 've been keeping an eye on you . 
You come across as laid-back but you actually work pretty hard . 
It was quite creative to involve even your enemy from the Inspection Department . 
If you were a little more meticulous , you may become a pretty effective weapon . 
I can 't believe that idiot , Tak Juil , just used and discarded someone with your exceptional potential . 
What are you trying to say to me ? 
Prosecutor Min Seojin . 
I must say , I admire you . 
What if you were to join me on my team ?
