- Please step back . 
- You can 't take pictures . 
- Please step back . 
No photos . - Step back , please ! Get back . Ma 'am ... 
- Control the crowd outside . 
- Yeah , we just called for backup . 
Make sure you get the witnesses ' contacts . So , ma 'am , did you get a good look ... 
You 're the case prosecutor , right ? 
Is this the main reason you chose Yoon Gilho ? 
Because it 's just easier to frame an undocumented man and close the case , isn 't it ? 
Why don 't you tell me who you are first ? 
It looks like you 're the one meddling with my case . 
I 'm Captain Kang Dongwoo from Gangnam SIU . 
I was escorting a Gangnam missing persons suspect when your people shot him . 
That 's ridiculous . 
Why would we intentionally kill a potential suspect ? 
You saw what those bastards did , though ? 
They were shooting at a dying man ! That 's not intentional ? 
Can you prove Captain Ju gave the order ? 
I don 't know whose plan you 're following , but you 're helping create the worst possible outcome . Keep that in mind , prosecutor . 
Get the fuck away from my car . 
COMMISSIONER MOON 
- Sorry to be calling so late . 
- Hey , what 's up ? 
They 're trying really hard to push their narrative . 
It 's likely the work of Tak Juil . 
Do you need some backup ? 
I 'm thinking of putting together my own team . 
What ? 
Why wasn 't I made aware of your order ? 
If this is how far you 'll go to make your story stick , you should 've at least clarified it before telling me to write it down . 
This Yoon Gilho , maybe he shouldn 't be our prime suspect ? 
Why is it so hard for you to do as you 're told ? Come on . 
I 'm just trying to put out the fire as requested by you , the chief prosecutor . 
While you were being indecisive because you wanted to be so thorough , another person lost their life in the heart of Gangnam . 
Stabbed dozens of times with a push dagger . 
What ? 
I mean ... ... we don 't have time for a deep discussion about the real culprit and all that BS , huh ? 
GANGNAM B-SIDE 
Hey , you can 't go that way . 
What do you want ? 
Let CEO Noh Joonseo know I 'm here to see him now . 
Hello . 
I 'm Noh Joonseo . 
Why are you all so sober ? 
You not having fun ? 
Aren 't you drunk yet ? 
You make me ! 
Okay . In honor of the rebirth of Club HYENA , everything tonight , all the drinks , all the food , it 's all on me . 
Okay , let 's get it ! 
- Noh Joonseo ! - Hey ! 
Make some noise ! 
Excuse my boys for making you wait here all alone . 
It 's a little too loud , isn 't it ? 
I 've called you several times as a potential witness in the Lee Gangsu murder case . 
I 'm sorry , I 've been swamped . I 'm a celebrity , after all . 
I didn 't mean to make you come all the way over here . 
- Here . 
- I 'm good , thanks . 
You met with him on the day he was found dead ? Yeah . He hit me up for a drink , we went out . 
He dropped some wisdom on me about my sit-down . 
Um , like , with the prosecution and all that jazz . 
Then I left first . 
It 's all my fault . I should 've taken him home . 
Well , I suppose so . 
By the way , can you just roll up in here like that without consulting the top brass ? 
Prosecutor Tak doesn 't seem to know that you 're here . 
You and Prosecutor Tak , you two know each other ? 
Of course . Tak is like my brother . 
And he made it clear that he wanted me to help you with your investigation . He says you 're his favorite . 
Since you came all the way here , well , I 'll help you out . 
Unlock your phone and give it to me . 
Don 't worry , I won 't ask you out . 
It 's a secret chat app that people in the business use . 
If you set the right bait , you might find something juicy . 
Yoon Gilho 's account . 
Yoon Gilho 's account . Looks like you know him too ? 
Well , a little . 
You seem quite sure he 's not dead , though for someone you only know " a little " . 
Of course I 'm sure . 
Stray animals always live way longer than they should . 
I 'll set up the game my way , so let 's make sure to touch base . 
No matter who gets to him first , I can 't wait to wrap this up and grab a drink with you . 
Oh , the last person Lee Gangsu spoke to on the phone before he died was saved under the name " Mr. Choi . " The call was from a burner phone . 
I wondered if you happened to know him ? 
I 'm not sure . 
Most people in this business are CEOs and chairmen . 
This is for you . 
If you flip this , you 're looking at a couple million won . 
Anyway , call me whenever . If you need anything else , you know . 
K-POP SINGER INVOLVED IN CHANGWON DANCE GROUP GANG RAPE CASE HAS BEEN ACQUITTED 
INDICTMENT DEFENDANT : NOH JOONSEO 
TAK JUIL 
Yes ? 
Hi . 
You can find here all the details on Noh Joonseo and Gangsu Entertainment . 
I included their close family members , so it 's a lot . 
Ma 'am , are you sure you want to review it all by yourself ? 
Thanks for the hard work . 
Oh ! Also , we just got an update that the weapon found at the place Lee Gangsu was murdered belonged to Yoon Gilho . 
Are you sure ? 
Lee Gangsu was killed by Yoon Gilho too ? 
Wait , I thought I was joining the Special Investigations Unit . 
This is what a real Special Investigations Unit looks like . 
Good God , are you for real ? 
I was excited to return to Major Crimes after three years . 
Looks like there 's no natural light here . 
GANGNAM TRADING CO ? 
By the way , is that punk Yoon Gilho even alive ? 
There 's no proof that he fled , and the search team seemed to have given up . 
What about the dead girl ? You find anything on her ? Oh , yeah . 
Name 's Lee Junghwa . 
Turns out she was with Kim Jaehee when she was taken to the Yeongdeungpo police station for larceny . 
No family , never reported missing , so I almost couldn 't find her . 
Prostitution , credit card fraud . 
Both were trouble makers after fleeing home . 
Investigate their social media and all that . 
What about Yoon Gilho ? 
Didn 't you mention earlier ... 
YOON GILHO ... that Yoon Gilho 's last phone call was made somewhere in Gangnam ? 
Yeah . 
Looks like it 's an arcade located in Nonhyeon-dong . 
LUCKY ARCADE 
That arcade over there , do you know when it was closed down ? 
LIMITED ACCESS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS 
It 's probably been about a year or two . 
They shut down the business after the owner died . 
The owner died ? You sure ? 
The owner was the madam of this bar . She worked with young ladies . 
The business was successful . Very successful . 
GANGNAM TRADING CO . 
Gangnam Trading . 
Do you really think they 're completely gone just because three years ago you stirred things up a little ? 
Hold on , let me show you something . 
Do you recognize either of these ladies ? Did they work for her ? 
She seems kind of familiar . 
But they all looked a lot alike . 
MORE MORTGAGE LOAN ! 
- Yeah ? 
- I told you we would find them soon . 
I sent you a link . Check it out . 
Turns out , they 're almost like celebrities in Gangnam 's club scene lately . 
The three of them seemed close , so I asked around the club where the blond-haired guy like to hang out . 
He quit the day after Junghwa died , claiming he was traveling abroad or something . 
Something 's fishy , isn 't it ? 
If we put the pressure on this guy , we might uncover information about Jaehee or Junghwa . 
MDLemoN , 7 MINUTES AGO 
Wait , he just posted something . 
Where is this bastard ? This isn 't abroad , this is Korea . 
Hey , man . Things are serious right now , huh ? 
People are saying Lee Gangsu was killed by Noh Joonseo . 
So you take care of yourself , okay ? 
You know how tough Jaehee is . 
Give me my money ! Give me my fucking money ! - How 's this your fucking money ? - Now , man ! 
Look at her . She 's got a lot of nerve . 
- Bitch ! - Stay out of this . 
- You son of a bitch ! 
- What are you ... 
Goddamn it . 
Hey , hey ! 
- You 're okay . - What 's wrong with you ? 
- Come here . 
- Hey , hey . 
You fucking bastard . 
Come here ! 
You don 't have any fear , do you ? 
You two girls are reckless . 
Clean yourself up . 
If you have nowhere to go , you can work here . 
The money will be a lot better here than it is out there for you . 
Where you take them after our joint is up to you . I never force anything . 
Any rooms ? 
Let 's go . 
Hey . 
Yeah ? 
Come back in two hours . Don 't be late . 
Don 't wait for me . Just go grab some food . 
I won 't run away . 
- I 'll come in if you 're late . 
- Sure , suit yourself . 
Oh , come on . Look at your face . 
Cut me some slack . Assholes were refusing to tip us . 
But ... I made them pay up . 
What are you gonna do with all the money you earn ... working your ass off ? 
I 'll work until I can leave this business . 
I want to go to a place somewhere like that where I can lounge until I die gracefully . 
At least how I die should be up to me . 
Since I have to die anyway ... I can at least smoke a cigarette , can 't I ? 
I heard you did that yourself . 
Could you do one for me too ? 
To celebrate our new friendship . 
Who says I 'm your friend ? 
What are you then , my lover ? 
It 's only ... because I want to cover this . 
Gross , isn 't it ? 
We 're back . 
Madam Baek . Madam Baek ? Madam Baek ! 
Gilho , call an ambulance . Call an ambulance , now ! 
Come on , Gilho ! Call an ambulance , now ! 
Madam Baek ? 
Madam Baek is dead . We 'll close the business . We gotta find some other work . 
Like what ? 
A convenience store clerk ? 
A dishwasher ? 
The other girls will eventually come back to this business . 
Bet on it . 
Then what the hell do you want me to do ? 
You don 't have anywhere else to go . We 're in the same boat . 
Can 't we just all keep working together ? 
I trust you to keep us safe , Mr. Yoon . 
Wow , so many Internet caf√©s with the word " zone " in the name . 
- Last one . 
What do you think ? Should I just go in ? 
So , once we find that guy , we 'll find ... 
What 's her name ? 
Jaehee ? It was Jaehee , right ? 
You said we 'll find her . 
Hey , that 's him , right ? 
Well , that bitch Jaehee is hiding , right ? What are you talking about ? 
I can 't find her if she 's not coming out . 
It 's not like you 'll handle it if that bastard Gilho causes a scene again . 
I will , you fucking moron . 
I said I will . 
Just hold tight for now until the heat dies down , though , you hear me , you little fuck ? 
Whatever , I don 't give a fuck . 
Chill out . 
Yun 's really pissed off , and he 's going to play a round today . 
I 'm going to set up the game and collect a payment directly , all right ? 
You got it , you bastard ? 
The fuck did you just ... 
- Do you know him ? 
- Uh , yeah . He 's a total scumbag . 
He gives girls drugs in clubs and sends them to hotels to have sex with clients . 
I 've wanted to catch that asshole for a while now . 
- Follow him . Keep your distance . 
What are you doing ? 
Hey , don 't shoot ! 
Don 't shoot , I said , you bastard ! 
Attention passengers . The doors are now closing . Please stand clear . 
JJOONI BOY JOONSEO , THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS WORLD 
Yeah , Ms. Ryu . 
So , I just visited the NFS , and I was told that the DNA found on Lee Junghwa 's body matched what was found on the knife . 
We don 't know for sure if it 's Yoon Gilho 's yet . 
So we don 't know for sure ? No . Also , we got a visit from her aunt . 
Lee Junghwa 's ? 
Lee Junghwa has an aunt ? 
Yes . Seems like she was her only family . 
But she refused to take the body . 
I feel so bad for that little girl . 
She doesn 't even get a proper funeral . 
- Let 's talk some more tomorrow . 
- Okay . Bye . 
Excuse me , miss . 
Do you know Lee Junghwa ? 
The doors are closing . 
Hey , what did you find out ? 
I went over the business cards you sent me but they 're just adult entertainment bars in Gangnam . 
In fact , Gangnam Trading Company doesn 't even have a sign anymore . 
It 's a regular office now . 
But I looked into that whole building anyway , just in case . 
Yeah ? 
I 'll send you the address . 
Check it out now . 
Okay . This is just ... 
... I can 't believe this . 
All right . I 'm busy now , so let 's talk later . No , wait . 
I 'm trying to tell you the building is one we know quite well . 
I 'm looking at it right now . 
Well , isn 't that just a fucking hole in the boat . 
Jesus . 
It 's a hostess bar . 
These assholes still haven 't learned their lesson . 
- Man ... - Hey ! 
Damn , you scared me . 
Jesus , what a bunch of fucking clowns . 
Unbelievable . 
Seriously , you 're still doing this , Jangho ? 
No , it wasn 't me . 
It wasn 't me . I-I ... 
It wasn 't me . You 're losing your touch . 
Hey , Seo Jisu . 
Is this how you greet me ? 
Go easy on me , all right ? 
What the ... 
Who the fuck are you , man ? 
Get out of here , you little ... 
You know where Jaehee is , don 't you ? 
I don 't know , I don 't know ! 
I don 't fucking know . 
Goddamn it . 
This fucker ... 
Hey , girls . Hey , wake up . 
Shit . 
Shit . 
What was that sound ? 
Put your hands up and turn around . Put your hands up and turn around ! 
Fuck , it 's you again . 
Dongwoo . 
Fucking Kang Dongwoo . 
Just get out of here , you piece of shit , you fucking parasite ! 
Come on , let go . Let go of me ! 
It hurts ! 
All right . Keep alert , yeah ? 
Yes , sir . 
This is fucking crazy . 
You know about Gangnam Trading Company . 
What 's your connection to them ? 
It is within my rights to remain silent . 
Why don 't you just do the paperwork and move on ? 
Who 's giving you the orders ? 
Who told you to kill Yoon Gilho and frame him for killing Lee Junghwa ? 
You don 't have the brains to pull that off . Who gave the order ? 
Did you kill Lee Junghwa ? 
Kim Jaehee too ? 
Hey , we 're done here , okay ? 
Put me in detention now . 
You motherfucker ! You fucking bastard ! 
You son of a bitch . 
Answer me . Who 's calling the shots ? 
Stop ! Let go of me ! 
- Let him go , asshole . 
- Hold him ! I 'm not done with you , you bastard ! 
Let go of me , you fucking bastard , let go ! 
Good Lord , this moron . 
The hell kind of deputy inspector sells drugs so openly ? 
I want him fired , no loose ends . 
- Sir , were you unaware of this ? - What ? 
I 'm asking if it 's okay to discard him like that . 
He 's the person who would undoubtedly retaliate against us . 
That 's why I 'm assigning you this task to make sure his hands are tied so he can 't do anything to us later . 
I wish you 'd quit looking for that person of interest . I need you to get your focus back on your primary responsibilities , understand ? 
For crying out loud ... 
Why is everyone like this ? 
The indictment process won 't be hindered with such strong evidence . 
I recommend you just admit the charges to get your sentence reduced - - 
Is that what he 's telling me to do ? 
What ? 
You know , don 't you ? 
I never make a move without his orders . 
- Captain Ju , stop - - 
- Prosecutor Min , could you give my family a call ? 
My wife must be worried sick . 
The wardens at this detention center ... Not really so generous . 
You want me to call the number we have for your wife ? 
She uses a different phone number to contact me . 
Maybe you could you write it down ? 
010 7251 5611 . 
Noh Joonseo . 
Please tell him I miss him a lot , won 't you ? 
And that there 's so much I 'm dying to say , but I 'll hold it in for now . 
We 're done . 
MR. TAK IS QUITTING 
I NEED TO BRING THIS GIFT TO MY SON YOU WON 'T LET ME DIE ALONE , WILL YOU , MR. NOH ? 
Goddamn it . 
Psyche , where are you ? 
Holy fuck . 
Hey ! Psyche ! 
PSYCHE 
I told you not to call me while I 'm shooting , idiot . 
- Joonseo , this bastard was actually alive . 
- Hey , Psyche . Where the hell is Noh Joonseo , you motherfucker ? 
- Noh Joonseo ! 
Mr. Yoon ! Wow , you 're not dead . 
Where 's Noh Joonseo ? 
You still looking for Kim Jaehee ? 
That bitch reached out to us and asked us for money . 
- Cut the bullshit . Where is Noh Joonseo ? 
- Oh , my God . 
Hold on , are wanted criminals allowed to fucking roam around freely like this ? Geez , wait , wait ! 
Wait , hold on . 
You 'll hear from Joonseo soon , man . 
Jaehee 'll be there too . 
We should have a party . 
- Excuse me . We 've responding to a report . 
- Cops ! 
- Over here . It 's him . - That guy . The black jacket . 
- Excuse me ? 
Excuse me ! - It 's him . 
Min Seojin speaking . 
I haven 't heard from my wife yet . 
Did you talk to her ? 
No , not yet . 
Forget about my wife . 
Actually , Prosecutor Min , I 'd like to consult with you after all . 
Just the two of us . 
Without Prosecutor Tak . 
GANGNAM TRADING CO . ? TRANSPORTATION , FINANCE 
PROSECUTOR MIN SEOJIN 
Damn it . 
You should answer your phone . 
It could 've been something important . 
What brings you here ? 
Captain Ju is going to turn himself in . 
I 'm meeting him tomorrow morning . 
So ? 
I know you have been on bad terms for three years . 
Share everything you know with me . I 'll convince Captain Ju , then we 'll be able to wrap this all up nice and quick . 
How can I trust you ? 
This whole thing is rigged by Prosecutor Tak . It 's a game you 're playing . 
If that were the case , I never would have come here . 
What would I gain by disclosing this information to you ? 
How would I know what Prosecutor Tak asked you to do ? 
I 'm the only one who can wrap this up now . 
I saw a girl . 
She was burning incense on the bench at the platform where Lee Junghwa 's body was found . 
As soon as she heard the name " Lee Junghwa , " she ran away . 
Was it her ? 
- I figured you knew her . 
- Oh , for fuck 's sake ! 
I need you to come clean . 
What evidence do you possess that I 'm not aware of ? 
Why were you with Yoon Gilho that night and why are you so fixated on him now ? 
This can 't wait . I need to know . 
Kim Jaehee . 
She 's one of the girls Yoon Gilho was working with , like Lee Junghwa . 
She vanished before Lee Junghwa 's murder . 
She 's my daughter 's best friend . 
I need to find her to save my daughter . 
Does that answer your question ? 
NOH JOONSEO 
Come to the club . 
I 've got a gift for you . 
What ? 
Guess what ? I found our stray animal first . 
Yoon Gilho ? How did you find him ? 
I set the right kind of bait . 
I know a bitch he 's willing to die for . 
Do you mean ... Kim Jaehee ? 
What the hell are you up to this time ? 
Captain Ju told the truth . 
I won 't let it slide this time so get ready . 
Captain Ju told you nothing . 
I know you haven 't even met with him yet . 
- You 're supposed to meet tomorrow , right ? - What ? 
It 's too bad though , Miss Prosecutor . Your morning visit will be canceled . 
Who is it ? 
Excuse me . Are you asleep ? 
Just go to sleep . 
Don 't you remember me , Detective ? 
Get lost , asshole . 
What good could possibly come out of his mouth ? 
The detention center must be full of people who want him dead anyway . 
You knocked my front tooth out at the hostess bar in Nonhyeon-dong last year , remember ? Look . 
Go ahead , turn around , Detective . You see ? 
I 'm just trying my best to help you out . Just tell me what you 've got planned . 
Come by midnight . 
You show up late , I 'll turn her corpse over to the cops . Okay ? 
You should 've at least gotten me a new tooth , you fucking bastard . 
LUCKY ARCADE 
PSYCHE 
I GOT JENNY COME TO HYENA BY MIDNIGHT 
DON 'T BE LATE IF YOU 'RE EVEN A MINUTE LATE , HER PRETTY FACE WILL GET ALL CUT UP 
JUST LIKE LEE JUNGHWA 
We gotta stop them , no matter what . 
These people are ruthless . 
Yoon Gilho is a dead man if he shows up there . 
Noh Joonseo gave me access to Yoon Gilho 's chat account . 
So you were the one who had information to share . 
I admit I made a mistake . 
You don 't have to trust me , but we need to find the real killer and arrest him . Whether or not it 's Gilho . 
Are you saying we can reach Yoon Gilho from a chat app ? 
- Wow , look at this . 
- Welcome , gentlemen . 
Damn , you 're fucking working so hard lately , Jjooni . 
What 's the big deal ? What do you want to show us that 's so fun ? Listen . 
If this is no fun , I 'm out of here . All right ? What is it ? Come on , show me . 
Gentlemen , the girl you 've been missing so dearly . I present Jenny . 
Holy shit . You found her ? - When , how ? 
- Jesus Christ . 
It 's gonna be a fucking fun night . 
Jjooni is so fucking good at his job , dude , seriously . For real , dude ? Where did you find her ? 
Tonight is gonna be fucking amazing ! 
I can 't believe it 's really Jenny .
