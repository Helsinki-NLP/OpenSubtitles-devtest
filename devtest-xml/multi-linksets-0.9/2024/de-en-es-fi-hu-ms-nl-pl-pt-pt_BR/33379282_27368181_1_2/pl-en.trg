GANGNAM B-SIDE 
This Special Investigations Unit was formed on the Commissioner 's order . So stay extra alert . 
The public 's watching us closely right now . 
Oh , hey . You 're here . 
I 'm sure you all know Captain Kang Dongwoo . 
Given the situation , he 's come all the way out here to help us . 
All right . 
Don 't get cold feet , everyone , just because we 're working a murder case . 
We 've got a new suspect now . So let 's shift the direction of this investigation and make use of what we have so far . 
Okay ? 
- Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . 
Hey , Dongwoo . 
When are we gonna get the autopsy date or ID the victim ? 
Thanks for your support , but , uh , regardless of who put you here , we 're not sharing anything about our investigation with you . 
Don 't get in our way , don 't get too nosy . 
Stay quiet while you 're here and keep quiet when you go . 
That would be appreciated . 
Let 's go eat . Yes , sir . 
- Come on . Let 's go . - Yes , sir . 
Hey , Jisu . What 's Jangho up to these days ? 
Send me his number . 
- Hello ? - Yeah . 
Jangho , it 's me . 
" Me " who ? 
You know who . 
Oh , Mr. Kang Dongwoo ? 
- You busy ? 
- Look , Dongwoo , you motherfucker . 
Stop calling me . 
You think I 'm still your little servant , you fuck ? 
Coming . 
... ruined my day . 
Hey , Sungbin , today is such a shitty ... 
KIM JANGHO , CEO 
If I remember , lots of water , two coffee packets ? 
You know , I miss your colorful language . 
EARN HARD , SPEND FAST WORK HARD , DIE GRACEFULLY 
So , how 's work ? 
It 's good business selling women and booze in Gangnam , you know ? 
So you 're telling me you make even more than cops do ? 
My father always wanted a cop son . 
I guess you could say it was his dream . 
Then you took my badge away . 
You know what I wanted to be ? 
A gangster . 
How many folks you think get to achieve two dreams in one life ? 
On top of that , I 'm a former cop . 
What do you need from me after three years anyway ? 
I 'm looking for a few kids . 
Do I look like an investigator ? 
And why would I help a piece of a shit like you ? 
Jisu told me everything , you dumbass . 
What 's this about ? Huh ? 
You beat up some of your customers . RULING OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS COMMISSION 
I had them put this on hold so you could cooperate with my investigation . Look at all your boys there . 
You don 't want ' em just sitting on their hands , right ? 
Christ sakes . 
Okay fine , what kids you talking about ? 
Well , uh , no . I don 't know much either . Like I told you . 
People call him Mr. Yoon . 
In this business , he 's a pretty well known pimp . 
I 've never met him though . 
I 'm telling the truth ! 
You think I 'm that stupid , that I would bullshit Detective Kang ? 
It 's been so long since he 's been in Gangnam . 
Tell us where this bastard is . 
And lose the attitude . 
I told you , I 'm clueless . I 've got no idea . Okay ? 
It looks like everyone 's looking for him because of all that shit about Gangnam and all . 
With the girl who died at Gangnam Station ? Yeah . So , you know about all that ? 
Look . 
Yoon had two aces up there . Two great girls . But then one up and died . So , what does he do then ? 
Closes up the whole operation and just splits town . 
And the other girl is ? 
Jenny 's her name . I never even met her . 
This her ? 
I never met her . I wouldn 't know what her face looked like . 
Without money , you never get to see something like this . 
Can we contact them ? These other girls working for him ? 
Are you crazy ? 
If you do that , he 'll flip out and you 're screwed . 
I sold all my leftover crypto . 
It 's not much because the market 's down . Thanks , man . 
I 'll pay it all back . 
What are you gonna do , for real ? 
All of Gangnam is totally upside down because of you . 
They 're all looking everywhere for Jaehee . 
Can 't you just cut a deal or bargain a little ? 
Give ' em what they want and find the right time to walk away . 
Junghwa is dead . 
" Walk away " ? I can 't do that . 
So , what are you gonna do then ? 
I 'm gonna stay in Gunsan with Jaehee . 
- I 'll keep an eye out for you . - No , Jaehee will go . 
And you ? 
They messed with my girls . I 'm gonna find those bastards . 
Easy . You might end up dead too . 
I 'm not gonna die . 
I owe you money . 
You crazy bastard . Shit . 
Lay low . I 'll keep you posted . 
- You 've been assigned a passenger . 
PSYCHE 
Oh , man . You 've got some nerve , showing up after causing such a shitstorm in Gangnam . 
- Shit . - Huh ? 
You paranoid bastard . 
Hey ! You thought it 'd be that easy to see a celebrity up close ? 
Motherfucker . Something urgent came up so he wanted me to deliver you a message . 
Hey , listen ! He wants you to bring Jenny . 
He 'll pay up , don 't worry . He 'll even get you your own bodyguard . 
You 've been scouted , you bastard . 
Oh , wait , wait , wait . Let me finish . Hold on . 
- Ow ! Oh , fuck . 
- You motherfucker . 
- Wait . 
Hold on . You 're fucked now . - Hey . 
- Ow , that hurts ! 
Psycho . - You motherfucker . 
The cops know what you look like now , so you can 't run the business anymore . 
- You fucking idiot ! Son of a bitch ! 
- What about the cops , you dumb fuck ? - I should just - - 
- Ow , Junghwa ! Junghwa ! 
Junghwa 's gone ! Fuck . But you should save the rest of the girls . 
And Jenny ? Is she with you ? No ? Fuck . 
Am I some kind of punching bag for you , motherfucker , huh ? The fuck ? 
This is an opportunity . 
Just bring Jenny back to him and he 'll give you whatever . 
Okay ? Name your price . 
You serious ? He 'll really give me anything ? 
Yep . 
Tell me what you want and I 'll be sure to let ' em know . 
I 'll talk to him myself . Yeah ? 
Arrange it . Just me and Joonseo , that prick . 
Got it . 
Oh , shit ! You son of a bitch ! 
Fuck , I 'm so pissed . 
Goddamn it . 
Back already , huh ? 
He receive the message ? 
Yeah , of course . 
I explained it nice and clear so he 'd get it . 
He said he 'd bring Jenny . And then all we need to do is get our hands on what those bitches filmed . And then , when we get everyone together , it 's game over . 
So , tell me , when are you gonna make the play ? 
Just relax a little . 
You know I get a bit anxious when something big is going down , right ? 
Why would you be anxious over this at all ? 
Just get it done . 
The bosses are doing all the heavy stuff anyway , no ? 
This tastes like fucking ... 
- Enough is enough , okay ? 
You think , because I 'm playing nice , means we 're friends ? - Motherfucker . 
- Oh , forgive me . 
LUCKY ARCADE 
A WOMAN FOUND DEAD ON PLATFORM AT GANGNAM STATION 
CCTV SHOWS A MAN ABANDONED THE BODY 
Please . Oh , God . 
GANGNAM STATION CCTV RECORDING 
I 've narrowed it down to a few suspects based on what you sent me . 
Someone was filmed at Gangnam Station two days ago you told me . 
Let me have a look . 
Yoon Gilho . Age 45 . From Damyang , South Jeolla Province . 
Missing for the past five years . 
I believe he obtained a new identity . 
He 's the only unregistered suspect on the list . 
His locations on the day overlap most with the case . And he was also filmed at the site where the body was found . 
Okay , that 's all we need . He 's our guy . 
You don 't want to look into everyone else ? 
Nope , it adds up with him . He even has a new identity . 
All right . Then , I 'll talk with everyone at SIU - - 
No , we won 't work with them on this . 
Let 's make it a joint case with Major Crimes . 
- Seoul Police Force ? - Yeah . 
We 've been working with them for a while . 
Your job is to make sure it all fits together neatly , and they will take care of the rest . 
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS ' OFFICE We only have circumstantial evidence . 
Even if we do include evidence from Seoul , we 'll require more direct evidence if you really want to get an indictment . 
Let 's just go with Yoon Gilho ? 
It 'll be convincing , since the man 's unregistered . 
Plus , I assume there 's a good reason why all the top brass want it to be him . 
Question , Captain . 
Fire away , Prosecutor Min . 
You 're not gonna use any big theatrics , are you now ? 
Don 't worry , we 'll provide exactly the right script to indict Gilho . It 'll practically write itself . 
You 're openly saying script ? 
Now , you 're not being cooperative , Prosecutor . 
Either way , this is on Prosecutor Tak 's order . 
Meaning whoever he decides to book , well , that 's who we book , yeah ? 
Wouldn 't you agree ? 
Fucker . Fucker . Come here , you little fuck . 
You think HYENA is yours ? Huh ? Is it yours ? 
I gave you a position because of your pretty face , not to get in fights with everyone . 
I gave you responsibilities . And what do you do ? You just party and get high ? 
So , you still haven 't found that bitch yet ? 
You know that pimp is a real nutcase . 
You little shit . That 's your excuse ? 
Hey . Can 't you see letting that little bitch get away is gonna land all of us in the shit ? 
Joonseo . 
Joonseo . 
Hey , Jjooni . 
Ow , my back . 
Here , come on . Come here . 
If things go wrong for me , they go wrong for you too . 
Do you understand ? 
Goddamn it . 
All right , you little bitch , go find her . 
Fuck ! 
I 'm gonna get him tonight . 
- Really ? 
Tonight ? 
- We 're having a guest , so get some champagne ready . And candy . Grade A only . 
And candy ? 
I mean ... It 's a really quick turnaround . 
Ah , is that so ? 
Fine , then . From now on , I 'll just handle it . 
Hey , come on . Don 't get all mad . 
I 'm just saying . 
I can manage it . 
Then manage it . 
Why 'd he do this to my face ? 
ARE YOU TAKING GOOD CARE OF THE STUFF ? LOL 
MIDNIGHT AT YEOKSAM JUNCTION THE CEO IS COMING , DON 'T BE LATE 
How 's the investigation with the Captain of Major Crimes ? 
You 've got to finish it in one shot . 
Too much delay only makes things complicated . 
' Cause once it 's wrapped up nicely and submitted , you 'll be on , you know , the fast track . It 's what you wanted right ? 
So what you 're saying is , you think you know what I want now . 
I do . 
We 're the same , you and I , ultimately . 
Cut from the same cloth . We have our pride , not much else . And we 're so eager to make it to the top , yeah ? 
At the same time we want to avoid looking too , uh , eager , so we 'll do anything to not seem proud and we pretend that we actually have some dignity . 
- Prosecutor Tak . 
- Hmm ? 
I 'd like to make one thing super clear . 
Having no connections at all , I learned to put up with all kinds of shit . 
But don 't ever think of me as disposable . 
If you want to keep me around , I will need to be adequately compensated , you know ? For all the extra risk . 
Here 's the thing . A negotiation is initiated by the one who has something to offer . 
You think I came to you without anything in hand ? 
You know , I became a prosecutor because I 've got a gift for reading people . 
Why don 't we get right to the meaty part , yeah ? 
Joonseo 's back and he 's free as a bird ! 
- I like it , I like it . 
- There 's one over there too . 
- Hey , Yun . You 're here . 
- Salute ! 
- Hey , Mr. Yun . - Sir . 
Ah , good ! Thank you for coming , Yun . 
Nice . 
You 're partying on the day of the prosecutor 's examination ? 
Yeah well , all of this was only possible thanks to your help . 
Stop stirring shit up . 
I can 't cover for you forever . 
Hey , now . 
One payment from me covered your son 's tuition in Boston . 
- You doing good ? 
- Yeah , but I missed you . 
Missed you too , babe . 
This is a gift for your son . 
What 's this about , Joonseo ? 
You know what ? You give a kid something like this too soon , it spoils them , ya know ? 
Oh , it looks great on you . 
Fucking asshole . 
I 'm after this guy , the one we talked about the other day . 
Fucking son of a bitch . 
So that was it , you slippery bastard ? 
A bribe ? Just ignore it all and go to work ? 
Keep your phone on . 
I 'll hand it over on a silver platter . 
Fine , shithead . 
Do it in one single blow . That 's all I ask . 
Have fun . 
Yun ! The box ! 
Hey , you 're forgetting - - 
The expensive part . I 'm taking it ! 
Yun ! Where are you going ? 
Do your best . Reach out to everyone . 
Whoever finds him first gets a million won and three months immunity from the cops . 
I never mentioned any immunity . 
You should motivate them when they 're doing so good , you know ? 
Don 't discourage them . 
Go find him . 
You 're doing great . 
WANT TO BOOK YOON GILHO 'S GIRLS ANYONE IN CONTACT WITH YOON ? 
Jwipo , there are 31 people in the chat . 
Why isn 't anyone responding ? 
Jangho , be patient . I 'm really doing my best here . 
I 'm doing my best . Oh ! 
I have something . 
- Oh , no ! 
- Seriously ? - What ! 
Reply to it . Hurry . 
DON 'T YOU KNOW HE SHUT DOWN AND WENT MIA ? 
WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING FOR HIM ? 
ARE YOU A FUCKING COP ? 
FUCK , YOU CATCH ON FAST 
I 'M JUST PLAYING 
YOON GILHO THAT FUCKER STOLE MY MONEY 
I 'M GONNA BRING HIM DOWN 
LOL , LOOKS LIKE HE 'S GOT MANY ENEMIES 
WHO ELSE WANTS HIM ? 
PSYCHE SEEMED TO BE GATHERING PEOPLE 
" Psyche " ? 
Who 's Psyche ? Anybody know Psyche ? 
Yeah , I do . 
He 's a thug and a merchandiser . 
He works for celebrities . 
- Where is he ? 
- I don 't know . 
Then find him . 
Okay . 
Okay , I 'll find him . 
WHEN ? 
LET ME GET IN ON THAT 
TONIGHT , AT YEOKSAM JUNCTION 
- All right , you win . 
- Whoo ! - Let 's call it a day . 
- This is so fucking awesome . 
Fuck , why are you here alone ? Where 's the girl ? 
And Noh Joonseo ? 
- Where 's he ? 
- Shit , man . 
Are you fucking crazy , huh ? 
You always gotta bring the goods to make the deal , asshole . 
You gotta make me an offer . 
Then the goods . 
Go fetch Jenny before I pull out of the deal . What ... Hey ! 
You 're shitting me . 
HE CAME ALONE 
YEOKSAM STATION 
How do we know we 'll find anything ? We just gonna wait here ? 
I told you to just go , huh ? 
Oh , come on . You need me . 
Remember you always needed me whenever you were on a stakeout ? 
You won 't quit talking . You hungry or something ? 
I could go for a cup of noodles , yeah . 
I 'm good . You go find some . 
I 'll go get samgak gimbap and stuff . 
Why are you fuckers looking so hard for Jaehee ? 
Don 't you know why , you motherfucker ? Stop , stop , stop , stop , stop . 
Let 's just make this easy on everybody and not complicate it . 
I want the girls and the motherfucking tape they made , huh ? 
The what ? 
That video your bitches took , man . 
Oh , you didn 't know about that ? Oh . 
Hey , you should 've let those girls do their thing . 
You 're not living in the dark ages , my friend . 
Your girls are women . 
All grown up . HE 'S NOT WITH JENNY , KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE VIDEO 
Just pampering them ? No , that won 't do you any good . 
- So that 's why ? - What ? 
Is that why you killed Junghwa , you fuck ? 
Hey . If you have any more questions , why don 't you ask these guys , you fuck . 
What a rude little shit . 
One thing ... I heard she was like ... 
" Please don 't kill me . Please , please don 't , " when she was begging not to die . 
JU YUN MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION CAPTAIN 
Yes ? 
Yeah , I 'll send you the location soon , just bring the warrant . 
We 're gonna catch the suspect tonight . 
Yoon Gilho ? 
We caught him already ? 
We gotta wrap this up before Saturday , remember ? Like Prosecutor Tak told us . 
Hey ! 
Oh , shit , man . 
This bastard is on a whole other level . 
He 's an artist . 
Look . You should at least be on his level . 
JJOONI 
Fuck me . 
PSYCHE 
Noh Joonseo , you son of a bitch . 
Fuck ! Oh , man ! 
Shit . 
Gilho ! 
- Hey , Gilho ! Where you at ? 
- Oh , my God , there 's more . 
You think you 're good but you can 't take all of us , motherfucker . 
Get in ! Come on , get in ! 
- What are you doing ? 
Go get him ! - Now ! 
Hey , Dongwoo ! 
Dongwoo , where are you going ? 
I told you to stay off my radar , huh ? 
Geez . 
Go get him . I mean it . 
Don 't screw this up , or else . 
Damn . 
Holy shit . LOCATION CHANGED I 'LL KEEP YOU POSTED 
Yes , Prosecutor Min . I 'll send you a different location . 
Take your time . I 'll have to re-do the work though . 
What work ? What do you mean ? 
Once the suspect starts talking , things will become unnecessarily complicated . 
I 'd like to make it easier for you . 
What are you trying to pull here ? 
Don 't do anything . Wait until I get there . Do you understand me ? 
Hey , where you been ? 
Oh , is your face okay ? 
Aren 't you tired of this place yet ? 
I don 't like it here . 
It 's just too much like the old days . 
That 's why I only come here when I 'm sad . 
So I can think about the old days , and go " I 'm so fucking successful . I should work even fucking harder , huh ? " All alone . 
You 're right . 
We were so innocent once . 
Innocent and humble . 
What are you saying ? 
Remember , you told me once we 'd take over the country with hip-hop and dance . I was so happy . Ramyeon , soju for dinner . 
- After practicing all day - - 
- Damn , what 's gotten into you ? 
Why are you getting all sappy and nostalgic on me ? 
Look at you . 
Really ? 
God , what is up with you ? 
You 're still an immature kid , aren 't ya . 
When are you gonna grow up ? 
Another soju . 
Oh , hey . Can I get a soju ? 
Hi . Are you Lee Gangsu ? 
- Who are you ? 
- Can I get an autograph ? 
Ah , you 're a fan ? 
So , what 's your name , kiddo ? 
MR. CHOI 
Hello , sir . I 'm Noh Joonseo . 
You know who I am , right ? 
Yeah , I thought so . 
If you allow me to speak my mind freely , your greedy little friend , Lee Gangsu , is of no use anymore . 
Gangnam Trading Company is ready for a new CEO . 
Kim Jaehee . Where is she ? 
You bastard , where is she ? 
You gotta know where she is . Yeah ? 
And why stick the dead girl 's body right there ? 
Ah , shit . 
What ... 
Ah , shit . 
Pull yourself together , all right ? 
Answer me . Come on . 
It 's none of your fucking business . 
You weren 't the one who killed her , huh ? 
It wasn 't you , was it ? 
Almost there . Almost there . Almost there . 
We got him . We got him . 
Step on it . Hurry ! 
What kind of cop keeps swinging and missing every time ? 
What ? 
Gangnam Trading . 
Do you really think they 're completely gone just ' cause three years ago you stirred things up a little ? 
For fuck 's sake . 
Damn , what the hell is going on ? 
Goddamn it . 
Hey ! Shit . 
What the hell is this ? 
Ah , shit . 
Are you okay ? 
The fuck are you doing here ? What ? 
Do not get in our way , Kang Dongwoo . Not today . 
The fuck are you messing around with this time ? 
- Hey ! - No bullshit . 
Get out of the car . 
Don 't get out of the car . 
I said , don 't . 
Geez , he 's hurt pretty bad . 
- Back off ! - Shit ! 
Dongwoo , stop there . 
Why are you pointing that at me ? 
Do you have any fucking idea who you 're aiming at ? 
Put it down , you bastard ! 
- What are you doing , huh ? 
- You 're dead , you shit-bag . - Let 's go . 
- Put the gun down , I said ! 
You motherfuckers . 
Get him now ! 
What the fuck are you doing ? 
- Back off ! Back off ! 
- Hey , hey , hey ! 
Back off , you bastards . 
Stay away from him or I 'll shoot you all down . 
You haven 't reloaded from the first round . 
Man , are you crazy ? 
Dongwoo , you lunatic . This is none of your fucking business . 
I 'm just doing my damn job , Yun ! Now , put those guns down . Guns down , bastards ! 
Dongwoo , could you please read the fucking situation ? 
It isn 't your job to die right now , you fucking idiot ! 
If you 're willing to die for this ... 
Fuck . 
Who ordered this ? 
This fucking guy . 
What are you doing ? 
Goddamn it . Hey ! Don 't shoot ! 
Don 't shoot , I said ! 
He was right there ! 
- Out of the way .
