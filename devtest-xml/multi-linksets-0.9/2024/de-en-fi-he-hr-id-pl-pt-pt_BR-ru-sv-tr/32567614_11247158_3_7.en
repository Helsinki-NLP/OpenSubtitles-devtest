Not sure what you hope to accomplish , Anna . 
I 've tried . It 's beyond repair . 
Huh , that so ? 
Well , don 't blink , ' cause you got your cart back . 
Goodness , I stand corrected again . 
What would our family do without your mind ? 
Your gifts will change the world , Anna . 
But it 's up to you to decide how to use them . 
- Dad ? 
The Assembly . 
They 're ... they 're not really gonna ... 
The mines , they 're seizing them . 
Go . Quickly ! 
Mages ! 
Perfect . 
Dad . 
Anna ... run . 
How many souls ? Over 500 dead , 800 wounded . 
Even more missing . 
The survivors must be protected . 
Gilmore , how soon can you cast that cloaking spell ? 
There 's nothing left to cloak . 
The dragons know we 're here . 
You have that look in your eye . 
What is it , Percival ? 
Ripley knew Whitestone 's location this entire time , but chose now to reveal it to Thordak . 
And I think I know why . 
The Residuum . 
Whitestone 's entire supply . Stolen . 
She used the attack to cover while she raided our reserves . 
Ripley has a mind for machines , not magic . 
Why would she need Residuum ? 
I may have a theory . 
Thordak knows this place now , and Raishan knows it 's unguarded . 
If we 're gonna get Ripley , we need to do it soon . 
Scanlan could try to find her again with Mythcarver . If he was here . 
I could check with my old contacts in the Clasp . 
If anyone knows how to catch a snake , it 's a guild of thieves . 
No need , I 've got her . 
Obsidian Thermite . A rare rock scorched by divine fire during the Calamity . 
This can only be found in one place : the Isle of Glintshore . 
She didn 't just leave this behind . It was intentional . An invitation . 
Clearly . 
But we 'll be going anyway . 
I see nothing wrong with that plan . 
Darling , I know this is personal for you . 
Are you sure you can contain yourself ? 
You said I 'm a changed man . 
Let 's hope you 're right . 
We 'll leave at first light , then . 
Right . Uh , side note . Where is Scanlan ? 
Hopefully , having better luck than we are . 
Kaylie ? 
Too late . 
You weren 't in bed this morning . 
I had to sneak out before anyone else woke up . 
You know , while it 's been nice having something that 's just ours , there comes a time when you realize what 's important to you . 
You want to tell them ? 
I want us to be honest with ourselves . 
I 'd like that , but telling them will change things , and we need them focused on the task at hand . 
I 'm sure you 're right . 
Of course , darling . I 'm always right . 
Huh , look at them , acting like we don 't know . 
Right ? How dumb do they think we are ? 
They 've desecrated every room in Scanlan 's chateau . 
I heard them on the billiard table , just , like , pounding it out ... We get it . 
Trinket , I 'm leaving you to watch over Cassandra and Whitestone . 
They need you . Understand ? 
Okay , we don 't know a tree on Glintshore , and Allura can 't teleport us ' cause we might wind up in the ocean . 
So ... boat , then ? 
No . We fly . 
Road trip ! 
Would you like my coat ? 
Thank you , darling , but I believe we 've arrived . 
Oh , thank goodness . 
A whole day with no ale . 
I 'm starving . 
Don 't worry , I 'm sure there 's a tavern just around the next ancient ruined bend . 
I 'll ancient ruin your bend . 
You all hang tight . Percy and I will scout the perimeter . 
Can 't see a damn thing . 
What if it changed things for the better ? 
What ? 
- Telling them about us . 
- Mm , please . 
Scanlan will mock me relentlessly , 
Keyleth will call me a hypocrite . My brother , I can 't even imagine what he 'd do to you . 
Are you sure that 's why you 're against it ? 
To protect me ? 
Why is this so important , anyway ? 
Uh , hold that thought . 
What is that ? 
Let 's go tell the others . 
Too risky to approach from the air . 
But if anyone 's out there , we can 't see ' em . 
If anyone 's out there , they can 't see us . 
Oh , a path . 
That 's ... convenient . 
And probably crawling with traps . 
- Let me borrow that a tick . 
Uh ... Why don 't you explode your own breakfast ? 
Ah , got one . A message from Ripley . 
The De Rolo crest . 
Something 's not right . 
That was easy . 
- Almost ... 
- Almost too easy . 
I ... Sorry . I 've just always wanted to say that . 
Well , it sounded really cool . 
Vax is almost finished . 
- Once we reach the cave , we should be ready to ... 
- Look . There 's a reason I 've been pressing you about this . 
I 'm in love with you . 
Percival , I ... I 'm ... 
Disarmed . 
Come on , let 's move . 
Stubby , come on . 
It 's quiet . Almost ... 
Almost too quiet . I 'm sorry . 
Did you see anyone when you and Percy scouted it ? 
Oh , uh , no . 
I mean yes . 
Yes , there were some guards . Looked like sailors . 
Percival . 
Orthax . 
Vax ? 
Vax ! 
Mother ? 
Who did this to you ? 
You did , Vex 'ahlia . 
Your love , it kills . 
Percy . 
Shit . 
Hello , Percival . 
You 're late . 
Welcome to your factory . 
A production line powered by a magnificent battery that combines the arcanum of Cabal 's Ruin , steam locomotion , and whitestone residuum . 
All inspired by your design . 
So this is what you 've been up to . Apart from decimating my home . 
I did you a favor . 
- You always despised your noble duties . 
- How dare you ... And once my delirium gas tears through the minds of your friends , you 'll be free of all obligation . 
A clean slate for our partnership . 
After Whitestone , you 're mad if you think I 'll have anything to do with you . 
A minor inconvenience . 
I had to improvise when I realized the Plate was a fake . 
The only issue is this power surge , once an hour , like clockwork . 
Look at yourself . 
Already trying to solve it . 
Why do you fight this , Percy ? 
The thrill of discovery , the ambition ... This is who you are . 
I 've changed . I 'm rid of Orthax now . 
A costly mistake on your part . 
But this partnership is unbreakable . 
When we found each other , I didn 't resist like you . 
I welcomed the insight , the clarity , the power . 
I accepted who I am . And I am so much stronger for it . 
Now Orthax will receive the souls of those slain by your weapons . 
And in return , everyone will have power of their own . And it will be up to them how they use it . 
But at what cost ? 
Your soul ? 
Mages took both our families away . 
That thirst for payback , it 's not why Orthax was drawn to us ... it 's why we were drawn to Orthax . 
You 're right . 
I 've deluded myself . Insisting I 've moved on . 
Maybe it 's time I accept that some scars don 't heal . 
I understand that all too well . 
We both do . 
We 're very similar , Anna . 
I 'm not perfect . 
But my imperfections don 't make me weaker . 
They make me who I am . 
Go ! Get him ! 
I told you he was useless . 
Let me have his soul . Fine . 
It 's time to settle our bargain . 
Stop it ... stop it ! 
Everlight ? 
As I warned , she will not be there . 
The gods promise honey and wine , swearing to remain by your side . 
They lie . 
Let go of me . Let go ! 
You want to help your allies ? To redeem them ? Do you ? 
Then put your faith in no one but yourself . 
The truth is in your blood . 
Kiki ! 
Damn . 
Vax makes that look so easy . 
This is useless , Percy . 
Our weapons are ready to ship . 
I 'm simply finishing what you couldn 't . 
The blood of every innocent life would be on our hands . 
I will not be complicit ! 
Progress cannot be stopped . 
Please don 't leave me . 
Please ! Dead ! They 're all dead ! 
What ? 
It didn 't work ? 
Pike ? 
Thank you . 
No , no , Mother ! 
Please . 
I kept hearing screams ... 
Mother . 
- I may need some help with the Big Guy . 
- A library ? Words ? All words ? 
Why are there no pictures ? ! 
Pikey ... Did I hurt you again ? 
No , buddies . 
I 'm just fucking spent . 
Wait . 
Where 's Percy ? 
Hiding like a coward , are we ? 
Your friends aren 't here to save you this time , Percival . 
Black powder ? 
Not a good spot , De Rolo . 
You 've had multiple opportunities to kill me . 
Weakness will cost you your life . 
Seven ... six ... 
Percival ! 
Wait , Orthax ! 
Always clever , Percival . 
And now revenge is yours . 
You can watch me burn . 
I 'm done with vengeance , Anna . 
Your transgressions have ruined many lives beyond mine . 
What we deserve is justice . 
I-I don 't understand . 
Why show me mercy ? 
I know what that demon feels like . 
Its hatred burning in your veins . 
But I can help rid you of Orthax . 
After time and penance , you could find a better way . 
Your mind could be a gift to the world . 
You 're serious ... 
Vex ... 
Percy ! 
â  ª So caught up , they didn 't know which way to go â  ª â  ª But the bond between them felt forever â  ª 
â  ª Would love win if they could only take it slow ? 
â  ª â  ª With twisted hearts â  ª - â  ª And danger faced â  ª - No ! 
â  ª Together â  ª â  ª But life moves fast â  ª â  ª And something felt wrong â  ª â  ª She ran to him but he was gone ... 
No . Pike ! 
â  ª Let him breathe again ... He 's gone . 
â  ª Now there 's nothing left , oh-oh â  ª â  ª Will life ever be the same ? 
â  ª â  ª Oh , that 's not how it 's supposed to end , no â  ªâ  ª Please don 't leave me .
