She 's too deep . 
Pull her out ! Even I am not that strong . 
This journey is hers and hers alone . 
Where are you , Raishan ? 
Grab your daughters and run . 
I know you 're out there ! 
Keyleth ! 
No ! Oh , no . 
Stay clear or you 'll be pulled in , too ! 
Those who cast this ritual experience the entirety of the world all at once . 
If they cannot resist its pull , the voices of the planet will drown hers out . 
Keyleth 's body will no longer be her own . 
The world will reclaim it . 
So thoughtful to bring us your vestiges . 
Yet I can 't help but wonder , why risk so much to find little old me ? 
You know damn well why . 
Oh , him . 
Percy did deal us quite a setback . But one the vestiges you 've brought me can rectify . Once you 've been properly disarmed . 
It 's unfortunate . 
He would be alive right now if he had made better choices . 
Or if you were there to save him . 
Ah , but you 're just as obstinate as he was . 
Percival possessed genius but no foresight . 
He couldn 't recognize the rot of this world , nor how to disinfect it . 
We could have toppled the old order . Given the people of Whitestone a chance against those dragons . 
But Percy didn 't care . He cared for his people more than you ever could . 
I 'm sure that 's what he told you . But I knew a pettier man . 
When he realized his weapons would feed souls to Orthax , he couldn 't stomach it . 
He 'd rather let the masses die than sacrifice his pride . 
You bitch . 
Having a problem , dear ? 
Sister , don 't . 
Allow me . 
The pull of the ley lines is far too great . 
The soil is consuming her . 
Keyleth , fight it ! Resist ! 
You stood against the council . 
Hold firm again , like a tree in a storm . 
It 's not working . 
Something is holding her back . 
What is it ? 
She 's not far along enough in her earth trials . 
There 's nothing we ... 
You saw something in her . She made you believe . 
Don 't give up on her . 
There is something , but it is perilous . 
Listen to me , Keyleth . 
Do not resist the pull of the world . 
Give in to it . 
I-I-I thought you said she had to fight . 
Ancient trees have roots vast and established . 
You must search the maelstrom below to find your tether . The things in the world that give you strength . 
The people you trust . 
I can 't ... I can 't find any ... Wait . 
Maybe ... I will not dishonor the Ashari ! 
- The Ashari could be in trouble . 
- Then they 'll have to deal with it themselves . 
Now connect yourself to them . 
Every time I raised my voice , I was questioned , dismissed . By my own team . 
She 's almost gone ! 
Do not hold back . 
There must be someone who gives you strength , who makes you trust yourself . 
I can 't . My girl , relying on someone else is the hardest thing we can do . 
If there is love there , it 's more rare than you know . 
The moments together are worth the pain apart . 
Give in to it . Tie yourself to him . 
Please . 
Vax ? 
You know I 'm in love with you , right ? 
No , no , no . 
No . Keyleth ! 
What is this ? 
She did it ! 
Not quite . 
You are the axis around which the elements flow . 
The rock in the churning river . 
Reach out across the world . Sense your target . 
Through sand and stone , follow the root . 
Trace it to the source . 
Trace it to Raishan . 
Wow . Cool trick . 
Trick ? It 's actually quite a difficult bit of sorcery . 
It took me a decade to ... Oh , no . 
Can I move yet ? 
What ? Yes , you can move , buddies ! 
God , I didn 't mean that literally ! 
Okay , nice to see you ! Got to pee ! 
By the Moonweaver 's tits , he looks awful . 
What do I do ? 
Well , I think you just ... talk to him . 
We 'll just , um ... Hi there . 
You aren 't too talkative , which is a definite improvement . 
Look at us , huh ? 
A couple of bastards . 
Guess that 's one thing we have in common . 
Listen , I know I 've been plenty hard on you . 
Some of that was deserved . 
But ... some of it was me being an insecure prick , like my old man . 
I figured if you didn 't know me , I couldn 't disappoint you . And you might not leave again . 
Truth is , when you tracked me down in Ank 'Harel , it was the sweetest thing anyone 's ever done . 
Knowing that someone was thinking about me , well , it 's all I needed . 
And I hope maybe that 's all you need right now . 
' Cause I do , you know . I think about you . 
I miss you , Dad . 
You do ? 
Who 's leading here ? 
You 're a lousy dance partner . 
Oh , yeah ? 
Wait for them to reload and then dash to get my bow . 
- Vax ? 
- Yes , I heard you ! 
Ready ? 
Not really ! 
Shit . 
Split up ? Split up . 
Shoot them dead on sight ! 
Fucking how many of you are there ? 
Stubby ! Brace ! 
Ma 'am , wait . You could hit the kegs . 
I know . 
We 're taking on water ! 
Load the longboats ! 
There are no words . 
I only wish Mom were here to see you . 
There was so much , I ... I didn 't know where I stopped and the world began . 
Until I remembered the ones who keep me here . 
Thank you . 
You do your people proud , Keyleth . 
And ... you found the dragon ? 
Yes . I need to get a message to the others . 
Do you have a skyship or ... 
My dear , the ground does not merely speak to us . It can also listen . 
Whom would you like to reach ? 
Careful now , Scanlan . Sure you don 't need me to chew it for ya ? 
Oh , I-I think I 'm okay . 
Better than okay . 
Thanks again , Pike , for sticking by me . 
You know , I got a feeling things are gonna be a lot more normal now ... What the fuck ? ! 
Can they hear me ? 
Uh ... Keyleth ? 
I mean , the reception 's not the greatest , so ... Scanlan . Pike . Grog . 
Come to Zephrah . It 's important . Please . 
Zephrah ? You think she found something ? 
Doesn 't matter . 
I-I 'm staying here . 
The hell you are . 
I am not leaving you again . 
Listen , you old twat . 
Your loyalty to these weirdos is your only endearing quality . 
Don 't blow it . 
- But ... - But nothing . 
Go . Save the world . 
I 'll be here when you 're done . 
Besides , I got a song to learn . 
Abandon ship ! 
She 's goin ' down ! 
What are you doing ? 
Load the rest of my weapons . 
There ain 't enough room for us and those crates ! 
Now there is . 
Well done , Orthax . 
Care to send our stowaways to the ocean floor ? 
Gladly . 
Behind us ! 
No ! 
Please ! 
Percy ... ? 
- It 's all over . 
- Not yet . 
Arrogant to the end . 
I just ... know something you don 't . 
My work ... would have made the world safer , better . 
The world would be better with Percy still in it . 
Come on ! 
At least there 's room for both of us on this thing . 
Ah , perhaps . 
But look what I found . 
Well , we did it . 
The others should have been here . 
I love you . 
But I do miss them . All of them . 
Should 've let that sink to the bottom with Ripley . 
I don 't think so , sister . 
I don 't know how I heard it . Maybe the Matron 's powers , but ... Percy 's voice came from this weapon . 
I don 't understand . 
Maybe I 'm losing it . But what if Orthax 's victims , Percy 's soul , is somehow trapped in here ? 
No . 
No , don 't you dare give me hope . 
Sister ... Believe me , I wouldn 't if I ... Okay , what the hell is this now ? 
Vex ? 
Vax ? 
Keyleth ? 
Uh , are we in trouble ? 
Are we ever not ? 
- We , um ... We got Ripley . 
- I saw . 
- Look , I need to apologize to all of you ... - Kiki , I 'm sorry how we left things ... 
- There 's so much I meant to say - I know I should 've stayed 
- but I was too scared ... - and explained ... 
Her turf . She talks first . 
Of course . 
Guys . I 've been begging you to listen to me this whole time , to trust me . 
But the truth is , I had to trust myself first . 
And I do now . 
You gave me that strength . 
That 's what a team does . 
And even though I shouldn 't have run off when I did ... I had to leave to understand how much I need you all . 
Especially you , Vax . Because I-I 'm in love with you . 
Now , w-what were you gonna say ? 
I , uh , don 't remember . 
Words ... not working . I liked Keyleth 's speech better . 
Dumb . 
Well , shit . 
Now that we 're a team again , we gonna finish this thing ? 
One more dragon . 
One last stand . 
And this time , we 'll follow your lead . 
If you have a location ... ? 
Hells yes , I do . 
What , no welcoming party ? 
Where are people 's manners ? 
Holy crap , is that a Ziggurat ? 
I should 've stayed in a coma . 
I saw Raishan , through the soil , preparing some ... ritual . 
Ugh , another dead end . 
Clear . 
Wh ... Did we miss her ? 
She 's here . Somewhere . 
You sound awful , Raishan . 
And you look even worse . 
Ah . The child found me . 
Just as I expected . 
So very predictable . Like sheep . 
Whatever you 're up to , you won 't succeed ... Child ! I have existed for centuries . 
You cannot fathom what I 'm capable of . 
But I grow weak . 
So there 's no point in holding back any longer . 
Not against you ... or your friends . 
Down ! 
It 's nearly over , Keyleth of the Air Ashari . 
When your people infected me , they had no idea what they awakened . 
No ! 
I shall avenge my suffering and wipe your kind from existence ! 
Only one thing remains . Yeah . For you to die . 
You see ? 
Predictable . Like sheep to the slaughter .
