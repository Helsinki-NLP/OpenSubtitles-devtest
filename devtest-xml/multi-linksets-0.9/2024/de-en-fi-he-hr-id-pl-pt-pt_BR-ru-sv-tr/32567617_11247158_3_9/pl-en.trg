No . 
You repay my leniency by attacking my throne ? 
I shall turn you to ash . 
Get these men out of here ! 
Dis is bad . 
They came to help us . A-And now ... They 're being slaughtered . 
Thordak wasn 't supposed to leave the eggs . 
We were gonna ambush him . 
Dear gods . 
Well , we can 't stay here . We have to do something . 
There 's nothing we can do . 
Okay . Plan 's down the crapper . 
Anyone got another one ? 
Percy would know what to do . 
The rest of those eggs are about to hatch . 
I say we stick to the strategy ... get to the nest while the army holds off the front . 
They were only supposed to fight the little ones , not Thordak ! 
Besides , Raishan 's tunnel doesn 't exist . 
We can 't get in . 
There 's still the main entrance . 
Oh , oh , the one with Thordak 's kids patrolling it ? 
The one we said was too dangerous ? 
That one ? Brother , we can 't just leave the others . 
Thordak will wipe them out in two minutes . 
And with our help we can push that to , what , three ? 
Fuck this noise . 
We do both . 
Keyleth , Pikey , go help the army . 
The twins will join once they get me and Scan into the nest . 
We smash the eggs . You smash his crystal . 
Any questions ? 
Dude , that was impressive . 
Sorry , I blacked out there for a sec . 
What 'd I say ? 
Come on , brainiac . Let 's fly . 
Ballistas ! Fire ! 
Do your best , cur . 
Fire at will ! 
I got you . 
What happened ? 
Why are you back ? 
Well , uh , we didn 't want you to die alone . 
It 's a-it 's a ... It 's a bad joke . 
We need to get the soldiers out of here , now ! 
To where exactly ? 
Follow me . We 'll double back against Thordak , and keep him busy . 
You 'd condemn us . 
We should rush the young ones and try to punch through . 
Don 't you two get it ? 
They got us boxed in with no way out ! 
You were saying , dear ? 
Through that wall ! 
Hurry ! Let 's go ! Zahra ! 
Kash ! 
I heard you two weren 't coming . 
- I 'd go anywhere for love . - Oh , um ... I 'm not ... 
Don 't flatter yourself , darling . 
Now that we 've joined the fight , you might actually have a chance . 
Ah , you know . Small chance , anyway . 
Let 's clear the front door . 
Oi ! Fancy a race ? 
Okay , we 're good . 
â  ª Scanlan 's Hand â  ªâ  ª Are you sure about this ? 
I never made a plan before . 
Yeah , neither has anyone else in the group . 
We 're fucked either way . 
They 're in . 
Back to the others . 
Look out ! 
Keyleth , get me down there ! 
No , no , no , no , no ! 
Raishan ? 
- What is she ... ? 
- Run ! The ground ! It 's unstable ! 
Stay close ! 
I saw Raishan . And she wasn 't helping . 
At least she 's not fighting against us . 
I don 't like it . 
Incoming ! 
Over here , fugly ! 
So , uh , what are we doing for dinner ? 
Kash , I wish you would take things a little more seriously . 
That 's no good . 
Cover me , babe ? 
Right . Careful . 
Here goes nothin ' . 
Oh , that stung ! 
Come on , big boy ! 
Enough ! 
Kash ! 
Wait . Hold up . 
- Is that ... ? No ! 
Gods , no . 
Don 't look . 
Kash ! 
Vax , we 're running ! 
Come on ! 
Shaun . Take Zahra and get her out of here . 
What about you ? 
He 's ruined one too many lives . 
We 're finishing this . 
Good luck , you handsome fool . 
Kash ... I can 't believe ... He won 't die in vain , damn it . 
Raishan said the soul anchor is the source of Thordak 's power , right ? 
So how do we hit it ? 
- Kiki , ready for the big one ? 
- Let 's fucking go . 
Now ! 
Are you all right ? 
Did it work ? 
There 's no way . 
That must 've done something . 
Let 's not stick around to find out . 
Come on , please . 
Fuck ! I thought I had it ! 
Well , you 'd better figure it out . 
Zahra , I can 't . 
Even when I doubted it , Kash knew these vestiges were meant for you . 
Thordak has taken so much . 
Make the fucker bleed for it . 
Ooh , Scan-man ! Ha ! I found one ! 
Uh , might want to recount , pal . 
Okay . Better hit ' em quick , or we 're gonna be seriously outnumbered . 
Wait , this feels wrong . 
I mean , they 're like babies , right ? 
Are you shitting me right now ? 
I mean , maybe we wait till they 're a little older ... 
Grog ? These are bad eggs , you hear me ? 
Now make me some goddamn omelets . 
Was that , uh , was that too much ? 
Rage ... ! 
Kind of terrified , kind of turned on . 
No ! Anywhere but the face ! 
â  ª Dick lightning â  ªâ  ª 
No , no , no , no , no , no . Don 't do that . 
Where the fuck 's he going ? 
Grog and Scanlan have to be out of the nest by now , right ? 
That 's not how our luck works . 
Grog , shut ' em up ! Shut ' em up ! 
Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! 
Stop ! Stop ! 
It 's me ! Oh . Whoa . 
You look like shit , buddy . Feel like it , too . 
Listen , we got to bounce before ... 
Oh , shit , hide ! 
My blood . 
My heirs . 
No ! 
Hey , you 've been the plan guy all day . 
- You got another one ? 
- What , me ? I just punch things . 
Wait . 
I punch things . 
Who did this ? 
Yep , that 's me . Yeah , I did that . 
Sorry . I thought this was an all-you-can-eat egg buffet . 
My children are born so hungry . 
Your blackened flesh will fill their bellies as recompense . 
Oh , yeah ? How are they going to eat me with a ceiling on their heads ? 
Fool ! You don 't know what you 're doing . 
Never do . 
You defy a king ! 
Fuck ... ! 
We 're dying . We are dying right now ! 
Look , the exit . 
Scanlan ! 
Whoo-hoo ! Oh , what a ride ! 
Right , Scanlan ? 
Scanlan ? 
W-Wake up . 
No . No . 
Can ... can you fix him ? 
Damn it . 
Please . You got to fix him . 
My babies . 
Our dominion . 
My precious future . 
Wiped away ! 
I will rend your flesh . 
Vax , what do we do ? 
We make one last stand . 
Pike , wait ! 
Put your faith in no one but yourself . 
It 's not the armor . 
It 's me ! 
I 'm here , Thordak . 
Fucking traitor . 
Raishan . 
Obliterate our enemy . 
By your command , my king . 
You bitch . 
You dare ? 
I freed you . Followed you . 
Assembled your conclave . 
You should have kept your word . 
Taste my disease . 
Very well . 
I shall return . 
Vex , Vax . 
This world can be cruel . 
Filled with those who would tear it down . 
But it is also brimming with hope . 
Take care of each other . Protect your friends . And remember ... there is nothing stronger than love . 
Thordak ! 
Don 't . 
I want to hurt for a while . 
He 's alive , but he won 't wake up . 
But he 's gonna , right ? I 'm ... not sure . 
We did the best we could . 
Yet it won 't bring them back . 
Mother . Percy . 
Go to her , brother . 
I was wrong about Raishan . 
It doesn 't matter . 
It does . 
I 'm sorry , Vax . 
And I should say the same to her . 
What are you doing ? 
Merely admiring what we managed to accomplish . Together . 
I ... I wanted to thank you . For helping us end the conclave . 
Your thanks are unnecessary . 
We both had reason to hate Thordak . 
Still , your alliance was appreciated . 
So what now for Vox Machina ? 
Uh , hard to say . 
I don 't know how we can just go on the same . You know ? 
What will you do ? 
Anything I desire . 
A-Are those ... ? Wait , what is this ? 
Your instincts do you credit , girl . 
I always thought you were the wise one , Keyleth . 
Never let your guard down around your enemy . 
You did give me exactly what I needed . 
Don 't you move . 
Come to congratulate me ? 
We already killed one dragon today . 
We can make it two . 
Such bravado . 
But I should offer my thanks . 
Without Vox Machina , I couldn 't have done any of this . 
Nor any of what 's to come . 
Fuck ! 
Where did she take him ? 
Are you all right ? 
Nothing is .
