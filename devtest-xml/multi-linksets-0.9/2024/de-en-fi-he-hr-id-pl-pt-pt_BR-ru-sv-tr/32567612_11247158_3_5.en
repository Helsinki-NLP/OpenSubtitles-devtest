We find the Chimera , we slay the Chimera , simple enough . 
So we head to the coast ? 
For the thousandth time , that is where the creature was . 
It 's obviously moved to the cliffs by now . 
You know what ? I am so sick of you second-guessing me . 
Maybe if you weren 't so shortsighted ... I 'm sorry , " shortsighted " ? 
Are you mocking my height ? 
I 'm mocking your thick skull . 
That 's enough , both of you . 
We 're splitting up to look for leads . 
Why don 't you two partner up ? You have such a unique rapport . 
Wonderful , babysitting again . 
Yeah , yeah . Just keep up , tight-ass . 
Like I said , by the coast . 
You mean the cliffs near the coast . 
Kima , wait ! 
I got this . 
You most certainly do not . 
Allura ! 
Kima , get down ! 
Are you trying to get yourself killed ? 
I said out of my way . 
See ? Told you I had it . 
Kima . 
Where are you ? 
Oh , shit . 
Anything ? 
Vorugal is still down there , I can sense it . Then what are we waiting for ? 
We can 't just charge in against a dragon without a plan . 
The plan is : I find Kima and rip that fucking monster apart . 
While that strategy has some merit , we lack the numbers for a dragon assault . 
And we 're out of time . 
In an hour , we have to reopen the gateway for our friends . 
Why this sudden prudence ? 
Would you wait if Vex 'ahlia was in danger ? 
Would you stand by if Percival 's life hung in the balance ? 
That 's completely ... 
Percy and I aren 't ... You aren 't what ? 
We 're not together . 
You could have fooled me . 
Still , you make a fair point . 
We 've always rushed into danger for each other . 
It would be hypocritical not to in this case . 
Thank you . 
This is what I meant . 
Getting involved causes all sorts of complications . 
But we 're not involved , are we ? 
What ? 
N-No . 
Then it 's not complicated . 
I wonder how the others are faring . 
I daresay better than us . 
Why is the Gateway so goddamn far ? 
Oi ! You think you can catch us , dingle-dick ? 
Uh , maybe don 't mock the murder-man . 
I know you 're out there . 
It 's only a matter of time . 
Keep hiding , rat . 
I 'll find you . 
Curious . 
The ice down there looks rather thin . 
We could use it to our advantage . 
Never mind the ice , do you see Kima ? 
Footprints ? Anything ? Well , not from this distance . 
Then let 's get closer . 
Be patient . 
We don 't have eyes on the dragon . 
This is Kima . She doesn 't do patience . 
Without me , she 'll put herself in even more danger . 
Perhaps we follow Allura 's lead . 
I 've never seen her so rash . 
All the more reason for us to keep a level head . 
Because we 're always so levelheaded . 
Cold getting to you yet ? 
Fuck this . 
Run , little rabbit . 
- Oh , by all means . 
- There she is . 
I have you now . 
Kima ! Over here ! 
Allie ? 
Damn it . 
Hold on ! 
Perfect . 
Wait ... Level heads , remember ? 
Caught one . 
Get down ! 
The hell , Allie ? Get out of here . I 've got this . 
All evidence to the contrary . 
No ! 
Yes ! 
Come on , fight back . 
Keep it interesting . 
Head , leveled . 
Nice bloody shot . 
I 'll find Kima . 
Meet me at the portal . 
Looking for a challenge , are you ? 
Oh , fuck my life . 
Lovely bottomless pit you 've found , darling . 
Quite spacious . 
Thanks for the catch . 
Mind getting me out of here ? 
Yeah , sorry , love . 
Fenthras has a mind of its own sometimes . 
Your weapon is too goddamn loud ! 
I 'm sorry , we can 't all blast magic out of our bloody fingers ! 
Oh , dear . 
Percy ... ? 
Looks like he abandoned you . 
Did I ? 
This hunt is far from over . 
Fuck it . 
Let 's get weird . 
- I 'm sorry I didn 't listen to ... 
- Forget it . Let 's go find our ladies . 
- Where the shit is the gateway ? 
- I don 't know ! All these rocks look the same ! 
It should be dead ahead . It 's just closed . 
Something must 've happened to the others . 
Keyleth , can you open the portal from here ? 
Oh , really ? Sounds hard . Try anyway ! 
There it is ! 
I can start it . But they have to activate it from the other side or we 're stuck . 
Think that guy will give us five minutes if we ask real nice ? 
Guess not . 
- Allie . 
The fuck were you thinking back there ? 
I told you to stay put . 
So you could dive headfirst into Vorugal 's toothy maw ? 
Someone has to save you from yourself . 
Really ? This again ? 
Why can 't you ever trust me ? 
I ... 
I 'm sorry . 
Look , I don 't do this shit because I have a death wish or anything . 
It 's just my way of keeping you out of danger . 
Um , ladies ? 
The gateway . 
- Right , right . Impending doom . - Of course . 
Not my forte , but I 'll give it a shot . 
No . 
He 's found us . 
- We need more time . 
- We 'll keep him outside . 
Or not . 
Hold him off as long as you can ! 
Are you crazy ? 
It appears so ! 
Guys , Vax is in trouble ! 
- Yeah . - We 'll get him . 
Oh , gods ... 
Scanlan , now ! 
Great , now I 'm crazy too ! 
Grog ? 
- Kiki , anything ? 
- It won 't budge ! 
Fire ! 
Maybe I can absorb it ! 
Pike ? Pike ! Get out of there ! 
The plate . I think it 's working . 
Oh , shit ! 
Oh , shit . Your head . 
What about it ? 
Oh , what the fuck ? 
Guys , look . The portal ! 
Oh shit , oh shit , I don 't want to die bald ! 
Move your asses ! 
Come on , come on ! 
Yes . It 's them . 
- Big boy ! Big , big boy ! - Help , help , help , help ! 
Big , big boy chase us ! 
Shit ! 
What is that thing ? 
Hey , you think they 're gonna fight or fuck ? 
Throwing a demon at a dragon ? 
Hell of a plan . 
That is what we 're known for . 
Your hair is ... 
Cram it , de Rolo . I 'm having a day . 
You 're mine ! 
Holy shit . 
Everyone to me , now . 
Wait , wait , wait ! 
Okay , go . 
This show is amazing . 
Hell yeah , it is . 
Okay , five gold on the fire guy . 
Oh , the one-two combo . 
Uh , come on . Get him , get him . 
Oh-ho-ho ! Bringing the pain ! 
- Did you see that ? 
Uh , maybe we watch from back there . 
Yeah , yeah . Yeah , a little distance sounds good . 
Clear the fucking way ! 
You lose . 
Is it over ? 
Maybe he 's too tired to fight ? 
Why do you guys have to jinx us like that ? 
Yeah , you 're right . 
Sorry , sorry . 
What do we do ? R-Run ? - Attack ? 
- I got an idea . 
Wait here . 
What ? 
Hey , that 's mine . 
Where the belligerent fuck is she going ? 
Don 't worry . 
That is Lady Kima of Vord . 
Slayer of beasts , survivor of Emberhold , and the woman I love . 
She 's got this . 
Yes . Come . 
Okay . Now some help . 
You heard her . 
We got you , Kima . 
Pour it on . 
He 's taking off . 
Looky what I caught . 
I will not be contained ! 
How is this thing still alive ? 
Oh , I don 't know . 
Can you cast a spell on a moving target ? Uh , what ? 
Kima ! Are you still with me ? 
Die , prey ! 
Thanks , babe . 
Ready ? 
No , but do it anyway . 
Careful what you chase . You might just catch it . 
Once again , just charging in , regardless of the danger . 
But that 's ... okay , right ? 
It 's what I fell in love with . 
Come here , tight-ass . 
I know , we 're not together . 
But that doesn 't mean we have to stay apart . 
Dragon scales . 
Vorugal . 
Another failure . 
Useless , all of them . 
Everyone is against me , but it matters not . 
My spawn are hatching . 
They only need their first prey . 
Is that so ? 
Who goes there ? 
I have the perfect place in mind . 
Whew , hair . 
That is a relief . 
Oh , no offense , buddies . 
Eh , none taken . 
Not many can pull off this look . You know what I mean ? 
It 'll be dark soon . 
Allura , can you ... uh , " bamf " us out of here ? 
Unfortunately , I 'll need to rest before I can " bamf " anything . 
I mean , I guess we can pile into Chateau Shorthalt . 
- Where ? - You know , my waterbed homestead . The hot box . 
The short shack . You know , my-my nightclub . 
We 're all a little tired for jokes , Scanlan . 
Trust me , if I made a joke , you would be laughing . 
Of course , I can 't do the trick without a door . 
You mean like this ? 
Grog , you 're amazing . 
Okay , just pop in my magical key , and ... 
Scanlan ... what the fuck is that ?
