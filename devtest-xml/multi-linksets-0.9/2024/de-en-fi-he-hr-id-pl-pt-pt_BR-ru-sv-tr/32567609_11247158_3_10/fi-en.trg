Without Vox Machina , I couldn 't have done any of this . 
Nor any of what 's to come . 
Da fuck just happened ? 
She took him . Raishan took Thordak 's corpse . 
Kiki ? Are you okay ? 
Of course I 'm not okay . 
She laid a trap for us and we walked right into it . 
- Oh , we didn 't know . 
- I knew . 
This entire time I 've known , but I couldn 't convince anyone . 
You can 't blame yourself for this . 
I don 't , Vax . 
Every time I brought it up , every time I raised my voice , I was questioned , doubted , dismissed by my own team . 
Wait . 
What are you doing ? 
Not waiting for anyone else 's approval . 
Not relying on anyone anymore . 
- Keyleth , please ... - Don 't . Don 't come after me . 
Keyleth ! 
Keyleth was right , you know . 
We deluded ourselves . Convinced each other we could solve any problem if we did it together . 
And you disagree ? 
Before Vox Machina , there was you and me . And we never left business unfinished . 
You want to go after Ripley . 
I thought avenging Mother would feel better . 
It didn 't . Because I know there 's one more wrong to right . 
What about the team ? 
There is no team anymore . 
If this is what you want , sister ... I 'm with you . 
What is happening to us ? 
So , still nothin ' ? 
His body 's healed . But he won 't wake up . Oh . 
Ooh , you try prayin ' ? 
I ... don 't know if that will help . 
Let me try somethin ' . 
Scanlan ? 
Hey , Scanlan ! 
Wake up , you lazy ass ! I got booze ! And naked ladies ! And naked ladies covered in booze ! 
Oh , man . 
Dat always works . 
Maybe he doesn 't want to wake up ? 
Buddies , you just might be right . 
I got to find Allura . 
Don 't move until I get back . 
Wha ... ? 
Sorry , sorry . It 's Pike , hello . 
You know me . Sorta . 
Listen , which room is Kaylie in ? 
Uh ... six . 
Thanks , Doc . 
I 'm her ride . 
You 're the healer . Why would I be able to do fuck-all ? 
Because he cares about you . Like , genuinely cares . 
I-I 've never seen him like this about ... anyone . 
Except himself . 
He 's been working on this song . 
It 's for you . 
Yeah ? 
Then how come he never came to see me ? 
He did . 
Tried , anyway . 
Kaylie , he risked everything to find you . 
Look , I 've known Scanlan a long time and we 've been through a lot . 
Are the two of you , you know ... ? No . 
God , no . 
Well , I mean ... 
Okay , fine , I did , you know , we were gonna try to ... We don 't need to talk about that . 
You bring something out of him no one else can . And , I don 't know , you might even make him want to live . 
Scanlan fucking Shorthalt . 
There you go , green friends . 
Keyleth ... 
How will I lead the Ashari if I couldn 't even get six people ... six friends to listen to me ? 
Stumbles are a part of growth . 
Like Mom 's garden . 
When she left , I overwatered , underwatered , wilted the whole thing . 
But I never tore it out . 
The seeds were there , just under the surface , waiting to be coaxed back to life . 
Except I won 't get another chance . 
None of this matters if I can 't find Raishan . 
You know something . Dad . Tell me . 
There is an ancient ritual . 
It can locate someone over vast distances . 
That 's exactly what I need . 
H-How do I use it ? 
You don 't . 
The ritual is extremely dangerous , known by only a handful of Earth Ashari . 
They will not share it without permission from the Council . 
Then you better call a meeting . 
Stilben . Home to the least trustworthy filth in the realm . 
You sure about this ? 
You can 't clean up the world without getting dirty . 
Then ... after you . 
Korrin , the Council has gathered . 
What business did you call us to hear ? 
Thank you , Uvenda , councilpersons , I ... Actually , I wanted to address you . 
I am Keyleth , daughter of ... Why are you not on your AramentÃ © ? 
I assure you , we wouldn 't have called you here if it wasn 't urgent . 
At the battle of Emon , I fought alongside brave Fire Ashari , who gave their lives against Thordak . 
We won . 
At least until Raishan betrayed us . 
And I think ... I know it 's my duty to stop her . 
Which is why I ask you to entrust me with the Earth Ashari Seeing Ritual . 
What ? 
Absolutely not . 
You 're not ready . 
I 'm not the same girl you knew when I left . 
I 've survived the Fey Realm , ridden into the Hells of Despath . 
I have passed through fire and become one with it . 
You have no idea what Raishan is capable of . 
The Ashari have dealt with this same dragon before . 
Our elders afflicted her with a corruption that will eventually be her end . 
Wait . 
We cursed her with that disease ? I-I didn 't ... There are a great many things you do not know , Keyleth . 
You 're barely through half your trials . And now you 're asking to , what , skip ahead in your AramentÃ © and learn this dangerous rite ? 
It could kill you . 
I can handle it . 
Can you ? Your mother said the same and she was never heard from again . 
As Ashari , our mission is to guard the rifts . 
Raishan may blame us for her condition . You may have personal animosity with her . But that cannot supersede your duty , and it does not justify the risk . 
The request is denied . 
- Dad ... 
- I 'm sorry , Keyleth . 
I must recuse myself from this decision . 
Lousy cheat ! 
Idiots . 
You 'll attract attention . 
Now get out of my sight . 
A pepperbox ... 
This little thing ? I picked it up in Darktow . 
You chose the wrong door , lad . 
Just came to ask where you got that pepperbox . 
I could answer ... or I could slice your throat . 
Don 't be trimming another You wouldn 't harm who keeps the cloak . a fellow member of The Clasp . 
No beads on your scar . Didn 't see your mark . 
Suppose we be doves , then . Guess that makes us friends . 
- Vex , get off , get off ! 
Sister ! 
- He was about to kill you ! 
No , he wasn 't . He 's Clasp . 
Apologies . She 's a little , uh ... - She can be a bit ... 
- Don 't worry about it . 
I got a sister , too . 
Fuckin ' love her . 
Let 's start over , shall we ? 
You 'll always be with me . 
And one day you 'll be ready for your own journey . 
You only have to listen . 
A ship 's been making its way up and down the Lucidian coast , delivering these weapons . 
Flies no flag . Bears no marks . 
Stops here to restock . 
Any chance you know when the ship is coming back ? 
Only docks at night . Never announced ahead of time . 
Then I guess we should get comfortable . 
You 're on your own now . 
I don 't mess with these fuckers . 
Thank you , friend . 
There 's no friends among thieves . 
Just remember , our debts are paid in blood . 
See you on the other side . 
May winds watch you all as you return to your clans . 
With the firelight extinguished , this council is adjourned . 
Not yet . 
Our business is not complete . 
You haven 't listened to me . 
The council has ruled , Keyleth . 
No , you did . 
Not them . 
I 've been told this fight isn 't worth the risk . 
Warned to be cautious . To wait out Raishan 's disease . To shut up and stay on my AramentÃ © . 
But that 's not leadership . It 's cowardice . 
You speak with a confidence you have not earned . 
Your mother knew th ... I am not my mother . 
My path is my own . 
A real leader is willing to give up everything for what she believes . 
That 's who I 'll be when I sit on this council as the Voice of the Tempest . 
Yes , the Ashari have a duty to our people . But we also have a duty to Exandria . 
Like it or not , we are part of this world . And I 'm ready to fight for it . 
I 'm ready to die for the people I love . 
You can deny me , Headmaster Uvenda . But I will not leave this arena unless I hear the same from each council member . 
Since this ritual belongs to my people , our opinion must be considered . 
We are Ashari , but Keyleth is right . 
We are also Exandrian . 
It 's time we started acting like it . 
Pa 'tice , you have no connection to this dragon . 
You won 't be able to perform the ritual for her . 
Which is why I will teach the girl . 
And the rest of you concur ? 
Thank you for standing up for my daughter . 
Hold your thanks , Korrin . 
Gaining the council 's permission was easy compared to what lies ahead . 
Many have died attempting this rite . 
So when do we start ? 
Still nothing . 
We should just go down there and force someone to talk . 
Stubby , I know you want to find her . But we can 't lose our heads . 
Of course . 
Methodical . 
How 's this ? 
I 'll see if I can pick up some conversation . 
You stay put . 
Great . 
It takes years for Earth Ashari to master their powers . 
To draw energy from the ground . Become one with the soil . 
But this place , a nexus of intersecting arcane ley lines , will help you access those same abilities . 
Strange statues . 
The ritual harnesses the nexus 's power . But even here it is difficult to master . 
Wait , these were people ? 
Remember what you possess as an Ashari . 
The force of the wind blowing your hair , the power of the rock under your feet . 
Like these ley lines , you are an axis around which the elements flow . 
And as soon as you teach me , I will use those things . 
But I cannot . 
Because I already have the ability . 
Like a mighty elm sprouting from a single seed , you must anchor your power and allow it to grow . 
A ship . 
Enough waiting . 
I am not missing her . 
Snap to it ! 
Nasty habit . 
Those 'll kill you , you know . 
Well . Look what we have here . 
Eh , your turn to roll . 
We caught someone snooping around the docks . 
Damn it , Vex . 
Connect with the ground . The stones , the mud , the imperfections . 
Like this ? 
Good . 
Now sink in , but slowly . 
Lose control , and you could lose yourself . 
That 's a calming thought . 
I ... I sense something bitter . 
Yes . The tether of enmity between you and Raishan . 
It courses through the ground like a sickened root . 
Follow it through the soil , through the rock . 
Follow it to her . 
Headmaster ? I-It 's too much . 
I can 't stay connected . 
Hold focus , Keyleth . 
No ! 
No , it 's pulling me under ! 
Keyleth ? 
Why can 't I do this ? 
The fuck you doing here ? 
Nothing . I was ... lost . Heh . 
Now you 're found . Sorry , hon . 
Anchors aweigh . 
Hold it . 
Boss told me to do the honors . 
Why ? What does she care ? 
Eh , you want to ask her ? Be my guest . 
Interesting . Where 's your hook , Nikolai ? 
Ah , well . Can 't fault me for trying . 
No ... 
The hell were you thinking ? 
You almost ruined us . 
I 'm sorry . I ... If I stop , even for a moment , everything I feel about Percy comes rushing back . 
Like I said , I 'm with you . But this only works if you 're with me , too . 
I know . 
And I am . 
Oi ! Intruders ! Intruders ... 
Cut the mooring . 
Launch the ship ! 
Well , so much for doing this quietly . 
Vex , a little ... help ! 
Shit . 
Thanks , sis . 
Nature can sense when something is holding you back . 
Now try again . 
Focus . 
Reconnect with the soil . 
I ... won 't ... fail ! 
Is-is that Raishan ? 
No . 
It 's something else . 
Looks clear . 
Welcome aboard . 
Ripley . 
At your service . 
Shit .
