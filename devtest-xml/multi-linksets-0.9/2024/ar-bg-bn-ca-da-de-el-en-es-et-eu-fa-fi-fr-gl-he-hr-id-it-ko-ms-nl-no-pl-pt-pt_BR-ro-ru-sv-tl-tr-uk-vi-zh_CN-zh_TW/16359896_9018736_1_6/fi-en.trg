We spend so much time hiding who we really are , making sure no one sees the person we truly want to be . So it 's hard to remember there was a time when we were truly excited to show the world our true face . 
Very impressive . 
That uniform suits you well . 
Does it look right ? I had trouble with the shoulder guards . 
There . Perfect . 
- What ... what is it ? - Nothing . 
Tell me . 
Your gauntlets are laced incorrectly , but no one will notice . 
What ? Help me fix it ! 
I remember my first war council meeting . They were smaller affairs back then . More private . Ozai , however , seems to enjoy having an audience . 
Father says he welcomes different opinions . 
I 'd advise against testing that . Best to observe and learn for now . 
There . 
How do I look ? 
Like a prince . 
Why are we off course ? Who changed the heading ? 
- Lieutenant Jee , I asked you a question . 
- We were given new orders . 
- New orders ? By who ? - By me . 
We 've been playing catch-up for too long . I think it 's time for a new strategy . 
I am the one hunting the Avatar . 
I am in charge of this mission . 
And I am an admiral . 
Fire Lord Ozai saw fit to put me in charge of all operations related to the capture of the Avatar . 
Of course I welcome your assistance . 
In fact , I expect it . 
I 'll need all the resources at my disposal , no matter how minimal . 
I 'll come by later to discuss a few personnel changes I 'd like to make . 
What 's happened ? 
Lieutenant Jee , resume our original course . 
Did you hear me ? 
Resume course ! 
Do you know what the punishment for mutiny is ? 
I do , and that 's why I can 't do what you say . 
Are you seriously gonna let this spineless slug tell us what to do ? 
We can 't let him come in and take it away . Not after everything we 've been through . 
For the last three years , we 've only had each other , and that 's still true . 
Only those of us on this boat know what it 's been like . Zhao is not the one who deserves your loyalty . - Zuko is . - Loyalty ? General , with all due respect , your nephew doesn 't know the meaning of the word . 
If he did , he would 've shown us , the people who 've been with him night and day for three years , a lot more respect . 
Instead , we 've had to put up with his insults and abuse and tantrums . 
I know Zuko has his rough edges . But you must understand he 's been through a lot . 
And he knows far more about sacrifice than you can ever know . 
Greetings , wise sages . I 'm glad to see you . 
Uh , my name is Aang , and I 'm here to visit the shrine of Avatar Roku . 
You see , I 'm the Avatar . 
We know . 
Wait ! 
You 're supposed to be men of peace ! 
After him ! 
I 'm a friend . 
This will take us to Avatar Roku 's shrine . Quickly . 
He must be close . 
Whoa . Easy , girl . 
Caught a scent , have we ? 
Okay , Nyla . Let 's go . 
My name is Shyu . 
Sadly , the Great Sage and the others believe the Fire Lord is their true spiritual leader . 
They have lost their way . 
So all of this belonged to Roku ? 
These are relics from previous Avatars that my grandfather gathered for safekeeping . 
I need to make contact with Avatar Roku . He 's the only one who can tell me how to save my friends . 
I will hold them off for as long as I can . 
Step aside . 
Great Sage , this boy 's the Avatar . He is a hope for the world . 
Remember the teachings of Avatar Roku . Fire is not meant to dominate the other elements . It should exist in balance with them . 
The only one who can provide balance is Fire Lord Ozai . 
He will unify the world , not the Avatar . 
And you have no idea how powerful he will soon become . 
Now , for the last time , step aside . 
I can 't do that . 
Then you shall burn along with the rest of the nonbelievers . 
Who dares disturb the peace of the Avatar ? 
Uh , it 's me . Aang . 
Is it not customary to bow before your elders ? 
And to avert your eyes ? 
And hop on one leg ? 
Forgive me ! I couldn 't resist . 
It 's good to see you , Aang , but what took you so long ? I thought you would come to seek my advice sooner . 
Avatar Kyoshi told me that I need to figure things out on my own . That it was part of my journey . 
Sounds like her . 
Kyoshi has always been kind of ... I thought you 'd all be like that . Aren 't Avatars incarnations of each other ? 
We share the same spark , but we are our own people . 
I 'm different from Kyoshi , just as you are different from either of us . 
For instance , what did Kyoshi tell you the role of the Avatar was ? 
She said I need to be a fierce , merciless warrior . 
Yes , there are times when the Avatar must resort to force and intimidation , but in addition to being a warrior , the Avatar must also be a diplomat . 
So we can solve the world 's problems without hurting anyone ? 
We can try , but there are consequences if we fail . 
Painful ... consequences . 
But like Kyoshi , I am here to aid you in your journey . 
Anything you need . It has to do with Koh . 
Anything but that . 
- You don 't understand ... 
- No , you don 't understand . 
Koh is a predatory spirit who can hurt you in ways you can 't imagine . 
Just ask Avatar Kuruk . 
I don 't have a choice , and I 'm running out of time . 
He 's captured my friends , and if I don 't do something , they 'll be lost forever . 
Please . I heard you defeated him once . 
No , I never defeated him . I only managed to take something from him . 
Perhaps you 've come to return what you stole from me . 
A totem that represents something that Koh needs and cannot forget . 
The pendant belonged to the Mother of Faces , an ancient spirit who crafted faces for all living beings . 
It 's because of her that identity came into this world . And she is Koh 's mother . 
Koh longs for the same thing we all do . Family . 
A totem ? 
Sounds like something he 'd be willing to trade for . 
Thank you , Roku . 
I hope that you 're able to save your friends . But the truth is , for the Avatar , friends can be ... a liability . 
The Avatar has to make the impossible choices , placing the world 's needs ahead of your needs . On that , Kyoshi and I agree . 
Trust me . 
It 'll save you and the ones you love a lot of pain . 
What happened to them ? 
Paralyzed . 
Everything 's gonna be fine . 
So you 're the Avatar , huh ? 
Not sure what all the fuss is about . 
You need to let me go . 
No , really . You need to let me go . 
People are depending on me . You don 't know what 's at stake . 
I 've heard the stories about how you 're gonna save the world . 
Here 's the thing . Some of us don 't need saving . Some of us have got this world figured out . 
You got your Firebenders and your Earthbenders and your whatever-benders , and they all want something . They 're all willing to fight to get it . 
So if you 're smart , you just sit back and wait for the dust to clear and then pick through broken pieces for the leftovers . 
Far as I 'm concerned , world 's just fine the way it is . 
Time 's up , Avatar . 
You did it . 
You actually got him . 
Feel free to count it . 
I trust you . You know why ? 
Because if there 's any missing , you 'll come after us ? 
Because you 're so cute . 
Oh , and careful . This one 's got a lot of heat on him . 
A bunch of hunters have been sniffing around . Folks not to be messed with . 
See you around , Avatar . 
Please just let me do what I have to do , and I swear I 'll come back . 
My friends are in danger , and I 'm the only one who can save them . 
If I don 't return soon , I 'll lose them forever . 
Why ? Why don 't you listen to me ? 
Do you know what it 's like to have people depending on you ? To have someone 's life in your hands ? 
Then please let me save them ! 
You couldn 't have always been this way . 
What happened to you ? 
The Earth Kingdom 's forces are concentrated along the southern coast . 
We tried flanking them , but they keep lengthening the line . 
How about a pincer move ? 
They 're anchored by cliffs . They can outflank any attacks . 
What would you do ? 
- Your Highness , I would suggest ... - Not you . 
Zuko . 
What would you do ? 
Horns tactic . Enveloping flanks , leaving an escape route to draw them out . 
Didn 't you hear the general ? They 're protected by cliffs on one side . 
Tundra tanks to come over the top . 
They 're Earthbenders . Our tanks would be buried under rocks in seconds . 
General . 
We could advance a division ... here . With the enemy 's firepower focused on that diversion , we can launch pinning attacks here ... and here . 
If you send them into the heart of their forces , how will they retreat ? 
They won 't . 
But they 'll be lost . 
You 're gonna sacrifice them . 
Sacrifice is a part of war . 
What division do you suggest ? 
The 41st . They 're mostly new recruits . 
Good . 
This isn 't something you learn in a textbook . 
Little boys should know better than to play at war . 
It 's a terrible plan . 
What did you say ? 
I said ... it 's a terrible plan ! 
Soldiers are gonna die , and for what ? 
It 's unworthy of a Fire Nation officer . 
You dare question ... Enough ! 
There is only one way to resolve this . 
Agni Kai . 
Someone 's out there . 
Let us through ! Do you know who I am ? 
Of course we do . 
Just as we all know you 're in defiance of my orders , which means that by disrespecting me , you 're dishonoring your father , which , I guess , shouldn 't be surprising , given the stories I 've heard . 
We 'll take the Avatar . 
Over my dead body . 
Tempting . However ... 
The Yuyan Archers . 
Ozai was gracious enough to lend them to me . 
It 's said they can shoot the wings off a glowfly from a thousand paces . 
Where will you take him ? 
Pohuai Stronghold for the night . Then straight to Capital City . 
He 's been waiting a long time , and I don 't want him to be disappointed any more than he already has been . 
If we take the Eastern Pass , we can make it to Pohuai by nightfall . 
- Prince Zuko . - Watch out for the Archers . But Zhao will likely station them by the Avatar ... Zuko ! 
Pohuai Stronghold is impenetrable . 
Why do you think Zhao told us he was going there ? 
He knows attacking it would be suicide . 
Entire armies have tried and failed . 
Not only that , but Pohuai lies inside Fire Nation borders . 
- I don 't care ! 
- But Ozai does , and if he finds out ... 
- But the Avatar ... 
- He 's lost ! 
For now . 
Right now , Zhao has the upper hand . But sooner or later , he 'll make a mistake , and that 's when we can make our move . 
Until then , patience . 
Make sure you get this . The Fire Lord will wanna know all the details of the Avatar 's capture . 
Make it clear I spared no effort in securing him . 
And we should add a few thoughts from the Avatar himself . 
If not for the Fire Lord , then for posterity . 
Now , Avatar , had you heard of my name before your capture , or was this the first time ? 
Please . You have to let me go . 
There are four guards , not three , and both his hands and his feet are shackled . - Make sure you get it right . - There are innocent lives at stake ! 
I can 't let everyone down again . 
Not again . 
If I were you , I 'd be thinking less about my past and more about my future . 
It 's not my future I 'm worried about . 
Really ? 
I mean , I 'd worry a little . 
Oh , you won 't be killed . If you die , you 'll just be reborn . We 'd have to begin our search for the Avatar all over again , so ... you 'll live . 
Though not well . 
Blow all the hot air you want . It won 't change your fate . 
What are you doing ? Don 't write that down . 
We are the loyal sons and daughters of fire , the superior element . 
Until now , only one thing stood in our path to victory . The Avatar . And today , we 've done something no one has been able to do . 
We have captured the Avatar ! 
This is just the first step . 
There will be mighty battles to be fought . But not tonight . 
We will praise the glory of the Fire Nation ! 
Did you get everything ? 
You know it . As much wine as I could haul . 
Gonna be some night , huh ? 
Let 's hope there 's less firespitting than Ahn 's birthday . 
My eyebrows only just grew back . 
- All clear . 
Who 's there ? 
Sound the alarm . 
Who are you ? 
Right . Run now , talk later . 
Make sure to include the full transcript of my speech , but change " loyal " to " faithful . " 
Now , was that " loyal " or " faithful , " sir ? 
The Avatar has escaped ! The Avatar 's escaped ! 
- There ! 
On the wall ! - Don 't let him get to the gate ! 
The Avatar ! Stop him ! 
Hey ! Here . 
Hop on ! 
Hold your fire ! 
I need the Avatar ... alive . 
What ... what are you doing ? 
Open the gate ! 
Do it ! 
Now ! 
Open gate ! 
Do you have a shot ? 
Take him out . 
Kill the mercenary , and recover the Avatar ! 
Now ! 
Where did they go ? 
Check over there ! 
Did you see anything ? 
I have a small boat nearby . 
We can 't go anywhere . Not with those soldiers still out there . 
You shouldn 't try to move . 
You 're hurt . 
- I 'm trying to help . - I don 't need your help . 
Fine . Have it your way . 
What ? 
Nothing . 
Can I ask you something ? 
Goat hair or rabbit ? 
Your calligraphy brush . Goat hair or rabbit ? 
Your characters are so neat . I mean , I could never get mine like that . Monks used to say lemur droppings were more legible than my brush strokes . 
Look , I know I shouldn 't have taken your notebook , and I 'm sorry . It 's been a lifesaver . Really . 
All the Air Nomad monks , they 're all gone . So all I had was your notebook . 
I can 't tell you how many nights I stayed up reading it . 
You helped me a lot . 
I mean , it helped me a lot . 
Goat hair . It 's stiffer , more control . 
My teachers made me practice every morning . 
I wasn 't allowed to do fight training until I had done 100 vertical strokes and 100 horizontal . Me too ! Except mine were for spiritual studies . 
A lot of the time , when I was supposed to be meditating , I was actually sleeping . 
I always got caught . Probably didn 't help that I snored . 
Those guys out there , they 're Fire Nation . 
So they 're on your side . Why are you fighting them ? 
They 're not on my side . 
But they will be . When I capture you and bring you back , I ... 
If I catch you , I can go home . Then I can take my place as the rightful heir to the Fire Lord . 
And that 's what you want ? To be the next Fire Lord ? 
Yes . Of course . It 's what everyone expects of me . 
Gyatso . He was my teacher . 
He said we can 't worry about anyone else 's expectations . 
I know . It 's not that easy . 
I mean , I 'm the Avatar , and ... it 's what everyone expects of me . 
All I do is worry about that . 
Maybe you don 't have to be like the other Firebenders . 
Maybe you could be better than them . 
You know what the Fire Lord is doing is wrong , so you don 't have to be like him . 
You can show some compassion . 
How dare you ? 
I 'm the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation . I 'll be the example for all Firebenders . 
And my father is a great man . 
Compassion ? 
Compassion is a sign of weakness . 
I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to hurt you . 
I have a feeling you 've been hurt more than enough . 
Prepare yourself . 
Father ? 
But ... I 'm ... I 'm here to duel General Li . 
You 're here because you have no respect for our military . 
- That 's not true . 
- Really ? Even when they come up with terrible plans ? 
My plans ! My strategy . My military . That 's what you have insulted . 
Forgive me , Father . I meant no disrespect . - Rise . - No ! 
Please , Father . 
Rise ! Brother ! 
Don 't do this . 
He 's your son . 
We 'll see . 
Rise and fight , Prince Zuko , so you can learn some respect . 
Is this everything ? 
Give me everything . 
Compassion is a sign of weakness . 
The soldiers are gone , so you should be able to get back to your ship without getting spotted . 
You know the worst part about being born a hundred years ago ? 
I miss my friends . 
Like Kuzon . 
He was the best . And he was from the Fire Nation . 
If we knew each other back then ... do you think we could have been friends ? 
You should turn in , sir . 
We 'll keep watch . Any sign of the prince , we 'll let you know . 
Thank you , Lieutenant , but I 'll wait a little longer . 
You 're wrong , you know . About him not caring . 
If anything , Zuko cares too much , especially about the people on this ship . 
Of course , sir . 
Lieutenant , have you ever wondered how you and the others were assigned this mission ? 
The doctor is creating a special herbal balm just for you . 
Now is not a good time . 
- I wish to speak with my son . - He 's hurt . 
- He 'll recover . 
- But he 'll never heal . 
The doctor says you 'll recuperate quickly . 
It 's a sign your body is strong . That 's good . 
Your spirit , however , still needs strengthening . 
You held back today . 
Maybe you saw that as a sign of respect , but it wasn 't . It was weakness . 
You must purge that weakness out of you . 
You must be willing to give up the weak to make yourself strong . 
That is what makes us the Fire Nation . 
That is why we sacrifice the 41st Division . 
Sometimes the weak can become stronger . 
Sometimes you just have to give them a chance . 
I have made a mistake . 
I 've sheltered you , and it 's made you soft like your mother . 
Well , since you seem unable to learn within the walls of this palace , perhaps the demands of the world outside will prove to be a better teacher . 
You will leave here immediately , and you are not to return until ... until you have conquered the greatest remaining threat to our nation 's destiny . 
You will find , capture , and bring me the Avatar . 
You are not to set a foot within our borders until this task is completed . Under threat of the severest of penalties ! 
Ozai ! You can 't ! Brother , it 's done . 
And since you 're so concerned with the 41st Division , take them with you as your crew . 
The 41st ? We 're the 41st . 
And you 're all alive because of my nephew 's sacrifice . 
There 's something out there . 
It 's him . Drop the lines ! 
- You 're injured . - I 'm fine . We should have someone look at it . 
I 've dealt with worse . 
I 'm not going to ask you where you went , but in the future , nephew , I would appreciate it if you let me know whether or not you 're still alive . 
There actually are a few of us who care about ... about such things . 
Attention ! 
Our prince ... has returned . 
What 's going on ? 
They must 've missed you at music night . 
It 's amazing how far we 'll go to hide our true selves from the world . 
Perhaps it 's because we don 't want people to know how much they really mean to us which is funny because the truth is , we would do anything for them . 
We 'd travel incredible distances . Risk our lives . Even fight monsters . 
But I suppose it can be scary to admit you need people . 
Some might see that as a weakness , a liability . 
- How do you feel ? After all , what greater pain is there than losing someone you love ? 
Or worse ... Gyatso ? 
... finding out someone you love has left you behind . 
Can we talk about it when I get back ? 
Of course . 
Once I save my friends , we 'll have more time . 
I guess that 's why we feel the need to hide away and protect ourselves . 
So we put on a mask . 
It 's not hard to understand why . 
What 's hard is knowing that sometimes ... the mask is who you really are .
