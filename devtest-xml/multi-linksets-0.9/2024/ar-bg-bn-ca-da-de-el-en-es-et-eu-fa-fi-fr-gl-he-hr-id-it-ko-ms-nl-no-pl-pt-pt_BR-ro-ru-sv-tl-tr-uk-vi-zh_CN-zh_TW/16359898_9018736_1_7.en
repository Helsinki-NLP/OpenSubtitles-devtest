Prince Zuko , the Imperial Guard , they 're coming to take the prince into custody . 
- What ? - The Imperial Guard ? 
- They 're already on their way . - Lieutenant Jee , slow down . 
I was just on Admiral Zhao 's ship going over the latest ... fuel usage figures . 
Lieutenant Dang and I were burning the midnight oil . 
Oh ! Dang stepped out to take a message . 
Keep drinking . 
I overheard them discussing new orders . Orders from the Fire Lord himself . He sent his personal guard to bring Prince Zuko back to Capital City , where he is to stand trial ... For treason . 
- Treason ? 
- Are you certain ? Yes , sir . I heard Dang order his men to shore to meet the guard . 
Tonight ? That means he 'll be here any minute . 
This is Zhao 's doing . 
Somehow , he 's convinced Ozai you 've turned against him . 
Pohuai , Zhao 's figured out you were the one that freed the Avatar . 
Prince Zuko , you need to leave , now . 
Do not start the engines until you are well clear . Stay off the main roads , and travel only at night . 
Uncle , we can 't let my father believe I 've turned against him . 
I know , but first you must get to safety . Let me sort things out with Ozai . 
Thank you , Lieutenant Jee . 
Stay safe , Your Highness . 
Jee had no idea . 
It was all too easy to get him to take the bait . 
What will you tell the Fire Lord about his son ? 
I 'll tell him the truth . 
That the prince chose to put his needs over those of his countrymen . 
And that his son was a traitor . 
Blasting jelly . 
The prince ! 
Zuko . 
Now I need to deliver my condolences to General Iroh . 
I 'm sure he 's been through a terrible shock . 
Zuko 's on his own , and he wasn 't anything like I thought he 'd be . 
He just seemed so alone . 
I 'm shocked . 
Sokka , Aang made a connection with him . Right ? 
I just realized Zuko and I , we both have a lot on our shoulders . 
This whole time , I 've been worried that I don 't know what I 'm doing . 
And the truth is , I don 't . 
I haven 't learned any of the other bending skills , and I 'll probably continue messing up , but at least I 'll be able to do it with my friends by my side . 
That 's right . Team Avatar . 
What is it , boy ? 
Look ! 
It 's the Northern Water Tribe ! 
We did it . We finally made it . 
They 're here ! 
Avatar , welcome to Agna Qel 'a . 
This is ... Beautiful . 
It 's perfect . 
We 've been expecting you . 
- Mother ! - Your beast is in good hands . 
My men will take him to our buffalo yak stables , which are in a heated grotto with plenty of light and space . 
Make sure he gets seaweed . Lots of seaweed . 
Of course . 
Welcome . I 'm Arnook , chief of the Northern Water Tribe , and I offer you our hospitalities and our protection in the name of the Ocean and Moon Spirits . 
Thank you . You don 't know how long we 've been looking forward to this . 
I can 't tell you the joy it brings us to welcome a long-lost brother and sister from the South . 
This is Master Pakku . He is our senior waterbending master . And this is my daughter , Princess Yue , our tribe 's spiritual leader . 
There 's something I need to tell you . You 're in danger . 
Avatar Aang ... 
I know it sounds crazy , but I 've seen a vision , and in it , the North is under attack . We know . 
Several days ago , our scouts picked up a Fire Nation fleet steaming this way . 
We 've been keeping track of them ever since . 
We are grateful to have you with us . 
With the power of the Avatar on our side , we 'll teach them a lesson they won 't soon forget . 
Citizens , it is a great day for our city as we welcome mighty allies , and we shall celebrate their arrival with a feast . 
- Feast . - The spirits have protected us ... - Stop staring . - Huh ? I can 't help it . There 's something about her . 
- Have we met her before ? 
- No . Now quit it before they think something 's wrong with you . More than there already is . 
I swear , I will not rest until I hunt down these villains . 
Our enemies can 't be allowed to get away with such a brazen crime . 
And I know where to start the hunt . 
I know who did this . 
It was Ozai . 
Ozai 's lost all shred of humanity . 
He 's become so obsessed with conquering the world , he cannot tolerate anyone who would get in the way of this , not even his own flesh and blood . I see . 
I sympathize . 
It does make what I 'm about to say a bit awkward . 
The Fire Lord has given me the honor of leading a great armada with orders to conquer the North . 
We know the Avatar is headed there , to the last great Waterbender stronghold , and so I am setting out to take it . 
Forgive me , Admiral , but you weren 't the first to come to mind for such a ... prominent mission . 
I admit that I have little experience in battle . 
Of course , that also means that I have no track record of failure . 
Unlike you . 
That 's enough . Enough ! 
The Fire Lord deems your performance below average . 
But I defeated him ! 
You should 've finished him at least two moves earlier . 
Thus , you will undergo another trial tomorrow . 
You realize he 's playing games with you , right ? 
Didn 't feel like a game when that boulder was flying at my head . 
Just saying your father already knows you 're the best . 
He just doesn 't want you to know that . 
Let my father empty his prisons . 
Send every bender he has at me . I 'll burn everyone in the world until he admits the truth . 
What truth ? 
That I 'm the one . 
Why don 't you just go and talk to her ? 
And say what ? " Hey there . 
Sokka , Southern Water Tribe . " 
She 's just a girl . 
She 's a princess and a spiritual leader . She probably sleeps on a throne and only eats dewdrops and sunshine . 
No way . 
Stewed sea prunes . My favorite . 
Is it good ? What 's it taste like ? 
Like ... like home . 
Katara ? I just wanna say thanks for helping me get here . 
I wouldn 't have missed it for the world . 
A world I wouldn 't have seen if it wasn 't for you . 
So enjoying the food , are we ? 
It 's delicious . 
You say you were entirely self-taught . Yes , I feel like I 've come pretty far , but I still have so much to learn . 
That 's why I couldn 't wait to get here to meet other Waterbenders and especially esteemed masters like you . 
It must 've been difficult to grow up cut off from other benders . 
The Fire Nation 's attacks took so much from you . From all of us . 
The worst part was I ... I couldn 't do anything about it . 
What 's important is you survived . 
That is what we do . Water is the element of change . 
And we Waterbenders have always adapted to the flow of life . 
Tomorrow morning , go and find Yagoda . 
She is one of our finest instructors , and she can start you on your journey . 
Thank you , Master Pakku . 
How about some cloudberries ? 
Here you go . 
Thank you . 
You can help me finish this . 
Come on . It 's pretty good . 
What do you think ? 
It 's delicious . 
When I was a kid , I used to hide out here when my dad would meet with the elders . 
He said he wanted me to see how things worked in the tribe because , someday , it would be my responsibility . 
Not very fun . 
Hmm , so I 'd hide out here with the grans and make dessert . 
You are just a girl . 
Did you think I wasn 't a girl ? No , no , no . 
I just figured with you being a princess and all ... - That I was stuck up ? - Yeah . I mean , no . 
I mean , that 's what I thought , but , no , you 're ordinary . 
Not ordinary , because that wouldn 't be good , and I think I should stop saying words now . 
I get it . I know out there I seem all ... but that 's what they expect me to be . 
Don 't get me wrong . I love serving my community , but every now and then , I just have to go somewhere and ... Make dessert ? 
No , I get it . 
You know , back home , it was my duty to protect the village . 
I took that seriously . 
Katara would probably say too seriously , but the thing was ... It 's your responsibility . 
Yeah . Yeah , and if I didn 't do it , who knows what could 've happened . 
You know , I made a promise to my dad , and I was gonna keep that no matter what . 
But there are times it would 've been nice to not have to worry . Times I wish I could be ... Just a boy ? 
How do I know you ? 
Princess Yue . 
They 're ready for the evening blessing . 
Thank you , Hahn . 
You didn 't have to leave the feast . One of the priests could 've come . 
It was no trouble at all . Really . 
Welcome to our ice wall . It has withstood attacks for over a century . 
Chief Arnook , if you don 't mind , I 'd love to talk to our brother from the South . Some combat advice . Me ? You wanna ask me about fighting ? 
You have something none of us have . Experience . 
Tell me , Fire Nation armor . Is it metal ? 
The reference we have has spikes on the shoulders . 
Uh , no metal . Leather . And , uh , they don 't have shoulder spikes anymore . 
The rest of the platoon should hear this . Would you mind coming to talk to them ? 
Um , sure . 
Tell me , Avatar Aang , what do you think is the best approach to the coming battle ? 
Might I suggest you lead the offensive front ? 
You could spearhead an attack ... Actually , airbending is primarily a defensive discipline . 
Our style is to evade and avoid conflict . 
But you 're not just an Airbender . You 're the Avatar . 
Truth is , I haven 't mastered any other bending . 
But that 's why I came here , hoping someone could teach me ? 
But we 've heard stories of how you 've saved communities , defeated the Fire Nation platoons , even battled monsters . 
How were you able to do all that ? 
My friends help me . We work together . 
It would 've been wise to have focused on your training during your journey . 
It seems we won 't be able to count on the Avatar . 
Water is life . 
Water allows life to flourish . 
And to heal . 
Master Pakku told me we 'd be having a special guest today . 
Thank you for having me . 
I 'd heard stories of water healing , but I didn 't think it was still being practiced . 
Oh , yes , it 's a vital part of our culture . 
Feel the flow of energy through the body . 
Connect that flow to the energy in yourself . 
Healing ... is more than a physical process . 
It 's about empathy . 
You must understand what it means to feel pain . Then take that pain away . 
You are a natural . Thanks . 
I 've gotten good at picking things up quickly . 
We had to think on our feet a lot . Nothing to focus your mind like a fireball coming at your head . 
Which reminds me . When do we get to fight training ? 
Excuse me ? 
I think my basic forms are pretty good , but I could use help with accuracy and increasing power . 
I 'm sorry , but women don 't fight . 
We use our skills to heal , not to harm . 
I don 't want to just heal . 
Healing is a noble and sacred tradition . The highest of callings . No , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it like that . 
It 's just that ... I think my skills lie more in combat . So if it 's okay , I 'd like to train in fighting techniques . 
In the Northern Water Tribe , women aren 't allowed to fight . 
Aren 't allowed ? 
That 's not right . But that is our way . 
Understood . 
They seem like a good group . 
We 've trained them as best we can , but none of them know what we 're about to face . None of them have seen real battle . 
Hey , I 'm sure they 'll do great . Especially with you leading them . 
So ... Princess Yue . She seems great . 
Yue , she 's dedicated , kind , generous . 
She represents the highest ideals of our tribe . She is the best of us . 
You like her . 
The princess and I , we were betrothed . 
It was arranged by our parents when we were children , but when she turned 16 , she broke it off , which is her prerogative . 
But she never gave a reason why . 
So you would 've gone through with it ? 
Thank you for coming to pay your respects to Avatar Kuruk . 
I 'm here to do a little bit more than that . 
I 'm hoping Kuruk can help me make a difference in this fight . 
Is that a problem ? 
It 's just been a long time since anyone went to Kuruk for anything . 
The truth is , his memory has faded for most . 
During his time as the Avatar , Kuruk didn 't engage much with the world . 
Some say he became enamored with the Spirit World and spent most of his time there . 
Unfortunately , that meant he wasn 't around much to help us deal with our problems . 
So he didn 't do his job as the Avatar . He let everyone down . 
I believe there must be more to his story . 
I hope you 're right because I need help , and he 's the only one who could possibly understand my situation . 
Hello , Aang . 
I see you made it to the North . 
Yes , because the Northern Water Tribe 's in danger . 
Avatar Kyoshi showed me a vision of Agna Qel 'a being destroyed by the Fire Nation . 
I need to stop that from happening . 
You can 't . 
If she showed you the North being destroyed , then it will happen . 
But the battle 's outcome is still uncertain . 
Whether the Fire Nation prevails , whether the Waterbenders survive , all of that is up to you . 
I 'm just one kid . 
No , you are the Avatar . When I was at Kyoshi Island , Avatar Kyoshi helped me unleash these incredible energies . 
The Avatar State . 
Yes ! She said it gave me the strength of a thousand benders . I can use that power to save the North . 
But to gain control over it , you need to first master the other disciplines . 
Except she was able to take control . 
She could channel the power through my body . 
She was in control . You can do that . That 's not possible . 
- Yes , it is . Kyoshi did it . - I 'm not Kyoshi . 
- But you still could ! - No , I can 't ! 
After I became the Avatar , I discovered dark spirits were on the verge of crossing over into our realm from the Spirit World . 
I had to stop them , so I spent my life fighting them . 
The war I waged on the spirits damaged my body and corrupted my soul . 
In my condition , I wouldn 't be able to control the Avatar State any more than you could . 
And despite all my sacrifices , I still couldn 't save the one that mattered the most . 
A predatory spirit came to seek vengeance on me . 
Ummi , my beloved , paid the ultimate price . 
The spirit stole her face . 
- Koh . - Listen to me , Aang . 
The Avatar must walk alone , or else the ones you love will suffer . 
Oh , sorry . I was looking for Katara . 
I should get going . 
Is something wrong ? 
No , I 'm just a little tired . 
I guess you need to go and " recombobulate . " 
I knew it ! It was you ! 
- Yes . - You 're the fox ! Yes . But how ? 
Not long after I was born , I got very sick , so my father pleaded with the spirits to save my life , and ... a miracle happened . 
The Moon Spirit answered his prayer and imbued me with some of its essence and restored my life . 
That 's the night my hair changed color . So you 're a spirit ? 
Part spirit , mostly human . 
Being of both worlds has meant that I can be a bridge between the two . 
That 's why I became a priestess , is to help people connect with their spirituality . 
It also means I have the ability to visit the Spirit World in my dreams . 
So you pop over there just for fun ? 
Wouldn 't you ? 
It 's magical . 
Not quite the word I would use . 
You didn 't like it ? 
What 's not to like ? 
Nearly being mauled by a spirit monster or getting my face eaten by a predator or reliving the most painful memories ... Painful ? 
It was nothing . Never mind . 
Don 't do that . 
Don 't make it less than what it is . 
It was something that happened when I was a kid . 
I overheard my dad saying he was disappointed in me . That I wasn 't cut out to be a warrior . 
That he didn 't believe in me . 
Do you know what I remember about you from the Spirit World ? 
You were worried about your friends . 
Your heart . 
That 's what sets you apart . That 's what makes you a warrior . 
I have a feeling if your father saw you now , he would agree . 
I need to know something . 
Why did you turn down Hahn ? 
Hahn is wonderful . 
He is everything that a girl could want . But he is not the boy of my dreams . 
My friends mean everything to me . I can 't do this without them . It 's how I made it this far . And with their help is how I 'll make it through this battle . 
We 're Team Avatar . 
There is no Team Avatar . 
There is only the Avatar . 
Stop thinking about what you need , and think about what 's best for them . 
Being the Avatar means being the one who bears the burden . ... alone . 
A bear ! 
Uh , actually , it 's a fish . See ? It has a fin . 
Hey , so did you talk to Kuruk ? 
Was he able to help ? 
No , he couldn 't help me . 
I 'm on my own . 
Ah , Katara , how was your time with Yagoda ? 
Great , but I wanted to ask . Where will I be stationed during the battle ? 
Women aren 't allowed in combat . I thought you knew . 
No , I didn 't . I wouldn 't have accepted it if I did . 
It 's not a matter of accepting anything . It 's how things are done . It 's stupid , and it 's wrong . 
This is not up for debate . 
I 've been fighting Firebenders ever since I left home . Can any of your men say that ? 
- Doesn 't matter . - Why not ? This isn 't about them . It 's about you . 
You 're not strong enough . Women aren 't strong enough . 
You haven 't been training and preparing to lay down your life for everyone here . 
And I 'm not going to let what happened to the Southern Tribe happen here . 
They won 't let me fight . 
They 've been stuck behind this wall for so long , they 've become frozen in time . 
Maybe we should talk to Yue . 
- Or maybe ... - Maybe we should listen to them . 
Maybe it 's better if you didn 't fight . 
This battle , it 'll be like nothing we 've ever faced before . 
I can 't lose you and Sokka . 
Aang , you 're not gonna lose us . 
But just the thought I could is gonna hold me back . These people need the Avatar . 
And I can 't be the Avatar with you around . 
I wonder what they 'll call me when the news reaches Capital City . 
I quite like " Zhao the Conqueror . " It should have some flair . Admiral , if I understand these battle plans , you are attempting a frontal assault on Agna Qel 'a . 
The city is surrounded by impassable barriers on three sides . Its front is protected by an ice wall . 
What makes you think you can succeed when so many others have failed ? 
Because I have something none of the others had . 
I have destiny on my side . 
Despite what our propaganda would have you believe , the Waterbenders are neither weak nor cowardly . 
Underestimating them will lead to tragic consequences . 
That won 't happen . 
For one thing , the fleet has been outfitted with new , deadlier weapons , but ... more importantly ... I have personally made arrangements to ensure our victory . What is that ? 
This ... this is destiny . 
He 's attacking the fortress head-on , like a bull in heat . 
There may be more , but he 's keeping it to himself . 
I fear I 've underestimated Zhao . He 's more dangerous than I thought . 
Yeah , I figured that out as I was swimming away from the burning wreck of my boat . 
We 've almost reached the North . Have you got a plan yet ? 
A plan ? 
The plan is to prove my father wasn 't wrong to trust me with this mission . The plan is to go in and capture the Avatar once and for all . The plan is to reclaim what 's rightfully mine ! 
So no plan ? 
I 'm working on it , Uncle . 
I 'm still surprised by Zhao 's boldness . I 'd have thought it beyond him . 
It 's almost as if he 's working with someone else . 
Someone much smarter . 
Choose your opponent . 
- You must select one ... - No , I 'm done . - Azula , stop playing games . - I 'm not the one playing games . 
This is your last chance . Fight or fail . 
You dare ! 
You wanna test me ? 
Set me loose . 
Let me go into the world and show you what I can really do . 
I 'm through playing games here . 
Look , Pakku 's an idiot . 
It doesn 't matter what other people think . It doesn 't matter if Dad didn 't think I 'd be a great warrior , but I can still be great in some way . 
The point is , I get to decide , just like you get to decide who you are . 
I 'm gonna challenge Pakku to fight . 
I know . He 's a master . He 's probably gonna mop the floor with me , but it doesn 't matter . 
All my life , I 've held myself back , and I 'm not gonna let someone else do it to me now . 
Katara . Remember at the Southern Air Temple when you said we had to go with Aang ? That we had to help him save the world ? 
You were right . 
If we hadn 't gone with him , I wouldn 't have seen how two kids from the Southern Water Tribe can measure up to anyone . 
Firebenders , Earthbenders , spirit creatures , even strapping , young Northern Water Tribe Warriors ... Sokka , if you 're trying to talk sense into me , you 're not doing a very good job . 
Sense ? Who 's talking sense ? 
No , what I 'm trying to tell you is ... go kick his ass . 
- What 's going on ? 
- I 'm not going to fight you . 
Because you 're afraid of what you might learn . That you 're wrong . 
Please . Go back to the healing huts with the other women . 
Fine . You wanna learn how to fight ? 
Study closely . 
Had enough ? 
Is that all you got ? 
I 'll say this . You 're an excellent Waterbender . 
But you still won 't let me fight . 
No one 's pushed Master Pakku like that . 
That was incredible . Those ice disks . How did you do that ? 
Can you show me ? 
Well , I doubt anyone 's gonna say you 're not strong enough now . 
No , they 'll just say I lost . 
Did you ? 
You said you 're afraid of losing us , and that 's why we can 't stay by your side , but it 's my decision to fight , not Pakku 's and not yours . 
Yeah . Do you think we came here just to leave you on your own ? 
Silly Avatar . 
I don 't know if I can protect you . 
You can 't . 
Yeah , and worrying about who will or won 't get hurt , it 's not just the Avatar who has to deal with that . 
That 's what it means to be a family . 
Kuruk , Roku , Kyoshi . They all said that I need to do this by myself . 
The Avatar must bear the burden alone . 
This is the past . Now , only one person can tell you the future . The person who 'll write The Legend of Aang . 
She means you . You got that , right ? 
The Fire Nation 's here . 
Time to fight .
