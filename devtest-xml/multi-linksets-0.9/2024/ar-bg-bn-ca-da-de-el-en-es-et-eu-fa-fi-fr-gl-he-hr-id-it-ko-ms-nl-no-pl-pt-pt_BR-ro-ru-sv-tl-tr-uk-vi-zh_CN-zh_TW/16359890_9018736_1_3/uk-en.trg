Everything is set . 
We strike tonight . 
Shouldn 't we wait ? We don 't have the numbers . 
We don 't need numbers . 
We have our anger . We have our grief . 
And for the first time in a century , we have hope . 
I want you to meet someone willing to risk everything for our cause . 
Like all of us , she has lost too much . 
My mother and my brother . In the Siege of Ba Sing Se . 
She works at the palace . She 's willing to help us at great personal risk . If she can summon the courage , so must we all . 
Fire Lord Ozai must die tonight ! 
There is no way out . 
But you must have known this was a one-way journey . 
Or did you expect my men to just lay down their arms after you slaughtered their Fire Lord ? 
We expected that all decent Fire Nation citizens would 've welcomed being freed from your tyranny . Tyranny ? 
Don 't you mean ... unity ? Prosperity ? 
Are we not the greatest nation in the world ? 
Have I not led us to the brink of bringing the entire world under one rule , our rule , to ensure an era of peace ? 
At what cost ? How many more lives ? Will it take another century of loss and suffering ? 
Do not speak to me of loss . 
My compliments on making it this far . 
Then again , we in the Fire Nation have always prided ourselves on our resourcefulness . 
Isn 't that right , Azula ? 
Yes , Father . 
You may have stopped us tonight , Ozai , but there is one out there who cannot be stopped . 
The one who will restore balance to the world . The one who has returned to us . 
The one who will restore balance to the world ? 
Can you believe they think the Avatar has returned ? 
Leave us . 
What 's this ? 
A message from one of my commanders in the Southern Seas . 
No one of any importance . 
What he had to report , however ... Zuko has found the Avatar ? 
Your brother has done the impossible . 
Just as I had asked . 
The Avatar . 
Really ? 
The water whip . Arms . 
Weight shift . Wrist snap . Okay . 
I don 't get it . 
Basic bending forms are mostly just physical movement , but when you get into the harder moves , like the water whip , you really need to reach inside and feel the energy flow . 
The monks always told us to find a place where emotion meets spirit . A place deeper than thought . 
Tap into your feelings and gather energy from them . 
Tap into your feelings . 
That 's okay . I bet it was my fault . 
I should never be a teacher . The monks always said I never listened . 
I think that 's what they said . I never listened . 
All the more reason for us to get to the Northern Water Tribe , right ? 
That 's right . They 've got the best waterbending masters in the world . 
I might even listen to them . 
Okay , it 's time to go . We shouldn 't stay in the same place for too long . 
I liked her too . 
Yeah , she was cool . 
Of course , I have no idea what she saw in you . 
Hey , what 's not to like ? 
Look ! 
- What is it ? Fire Nation ? - No ! 
I think ... I think it 's another Airbender ! 
He 's headed for that mountain . 
That 's no mountain ! 
That 's Omashu ! 
Appa ! Yip yip ! 
He could be anywhere . He was headed north when he left Kyoshi Island . 
He 'll need to stop for food and water . He may be the Avatar , but he still needs to eat and drink . 
The population center , then . 
- I can alert my contacts . - No ! I told you , no one else can know of his existence . 
Understood . But if I may , we have a window of opportunity as long as the Avatar remains in this area . 
If he gets too far north ... There are Fire Nation forces everywhere . They 're sure to find out . 
Which is why I suggest you allow me to contact a few trusted sources . 
They don 't need to be told any more than necessary . 
Very good . 
Commander Zhao 's ship has arrived . Perfect timing . To the Fire Nation . 
I don 't like him . 
He does have a disagreeable quality . 
I spoke to some of his crew . Word is Zhao failed his officer training program three times . Did I ask for your opinion ? 
My apologies . 
He was only trying to help . 
He was gossiping about a superior officer . 
- An officer you don 't like . - That 's beside the point . 
There is an order to the way we do things here . Rules . 
We are Fire Nation , even out here . 
Especially out here . 
Omashu was carved out of a living mountain . It 's one of the wonders of the Earth Kingdom . Of the world , actually . 
And they have an incredible delivery system that winds through the whole city . 
And the people there , they 're artists , scientists , builders . Plus , the food there is amazing . 
You again ? 
What did I tell you before ? 
You ! Step forward ! 
They don 't take kindly to outsiders in Omashu . 
What makes you think we 're outsiders ? 
No reason . 
Wait . 
We 're new here , but we have a friend we need to see . 
We just could use a little help getting inside . 
Sorry . It 's either that or the turnip sack . 
I 'm sure you can make that look good too . 
Omashu 's one of the last Earth Kingdom strongholds . 
Try as they might , Firebenders haven 't been able to take it yet . 
So how do you know we 're not a threat ? Just a feeling . 
Hold there . 
State your business . 
Headed to market , as usual . 
Oh , wasn 't a great crop this month . 
She told me I wasn 't watering the turnips enough . Knew there was a reason I married her . 
Irrigation , am I right ? 
Uh , my ... my brother-in-law would agree if he could speak . 
Struck mute at birth . 
You 'd be amazed at how much he can say without words . 
Just the other day , he made us laugh so hard ... All right , that 's enough . Move along . 
Good luck finding your friend . 
There he is . Look . 
Aang , wait up ! 
Hey , watch out for my ... 
An Airbender ? Of course I 'm not . 
Help ! 
Aang , we can 't see ! 
He 's an Airbender . 
And you 're a Waterbender . 
Teo ! Teo ! 
- Are you all right ? Are you hurt ? - Dad , I 'm ... I 'm fine . - We should get him out of the smoke . - Here . Our house is right here . 
Thank you . 
- Thank you ... - Katara . 
My name is Sai . 
What were you doing out there ? 
I just landed . How was I to know there 'd be another bombing ? Bombing ? You mean that wasn 't an accident ? 
Nothing the Fire Nation does is an accident . 
The Fire Nation ? 
Yeah . Their spies are everywhere in the city . 
It 's not safe anywhere these days . 
Omashu can be a dangerous place . 
More water . More water . 
You 're an Airbender . Do you realize what this means ? 
We finally have a way to take the fight to the enemy . You could drop bombs on them . Rain down destruction . 
Air power is their weakness , and you ... you are air power . 
Pretty great , huh ? Dad 's the mechanist to the King of Omashu . 
" Mechanist " ? 
Ah , just a fancy word for someone who wastes a lot of time tinkering . 
Don 't listen to him . 
He 's responsible for maintaining the best parts of the city . Like our delivery system . You 've seen it , right ? 
It 's amazing . 
I play but a small role . 
Hey , if everyone in Omashu were as dedicated as you , this war would be over . 
The Fire Nation would be on their knees by now . 
Well , we have our own part to play in the war . Right , Aang ? 
Yes . Yes , uh , which is why we have to go . 
Oh , right . Of course . 
Just promise me you 'll really stick it to the Firebenders . Make ' em pay . 
- Sokka . - This stuff is incredible . I mean , look at this . 
Those are for cleaning under your toenails . 
It can get bloody . 
Did you see the mechanism on that sorting machine ? It 's spring-powered . Ingenious . Should 've done that with our kayak racks . 
You 're all right . 
This place used to be incredible . A place I couldn 't wait to see . 
A place where amazing things were created , not destroyed . 
It 's my responsibility to help these people . 
How are you gonna do that ? 
Being the Avatar isn 't just about fighting . It 's about helping people , like Teo and his father and everyone in this city . What about getting to the North ? Didn 't Kyoshi tell you you had to get there to prevent a tragedy ? 
Yes , and I 'm gonna do that , but I have to do this too . 
If I 'm gonna save the world , I have to do it one person at a time . 
That 's why I 'm staying in Omashu because I wanna help , and I think I can . 
Because I 'm the Avatar . 
Now tell me about these bombings . 
" He 's done the impossible . " He 's done nothing . He spent three years on an ocean cruise while I 've been here doing everything Father has asked . 
Who 's the one risking her life to root out traitors ? Oh , that 's right ! Tell us about your mission . Were you nervous ? Was your life really in danger ? 
Not really . People in the resistance aren 't the brightest of flames . 
Then again , what can you expect from peasants ? 
At least you got out into the city . 
Zuko may be banished , but he 's out there exploring the world . If I were him , I wouldn 't wanna come back . 
Yeah , well , all dear old Zuzu wants is to make it back here and take away everything I 've worked for . 
Technically , he is first in line to be Fire Lord . 
Not that he deserves to be . 
He doesn 't , but now he has hope . 
- And that 's dangerous . - Retreat ! 
So what can you do about it ? 
You 're here . He 's out there . 
There are always ways to get in the game if you know which pieces to play . 
The Avatar has returned . 
My mother told me stories of the Avatar and how he 'd return one day . Dad , do you remember her stories ? 
What I remember is that your mother was taken from us by this cursed war and everything we 've had to do to stay alive since then . We worked hard , and we kept our heads down . 
- That 's not how we 'll change the world . - But it is how we 'll survive . 
You pretend like you don 't care , but I know you hate the Fire Nation as much as I do . 
Why else would you build all this if not to help our army ? Like this . 
That 's just an experiment . I can 't even get the damn thing to work . 
Look , I 'm not here to cause any trouble . 
I know how . I have a hunch about where the bombers might be gathering . 
It 's high up on the mountain . 
Can 't really reach there by myself , but with your airbending ... Just there . The strongest updrafts are in the morning , so we should fly then . 
What , tomorrow ? No , Teo , you 're supposed to help me with the airship . 
I still need to fix the attitude control before I show it to the generals . 
I can help with that . 
My sources say an Airbender was spotted there . 
Omashu . 
Enemy territory . 
Indeed , but not to worry . 
There are ways to gain entry if you know the right people , which I do . 
I 'll send two of my best men to confirm the report . 
- They can be in and out before ... - No . 
Uncle Iroh and I will go . No one else . 
As you wish . 
I trust you understand the danger . 
If anything happens in Omashu , we won 't be able to help you . 
The prince and I will be fine . 
- What are you do ... 
Fire Nation spies . 
But that means the mechanist is a ... Traitor . 
Come on . 
The mechanist has been working for the Fire Nation , building devices , selling secrets . 
Sokka and Aang . They 're in danger . - I 've gotta warn them . - They 'll be fine . 
The mechanist may be a turncoat , but he 's a coward . 
He 'd never take any direct action . 
This one , on the other hand ... Wait . 
Who are you ? 
They call me Jet . 
They 're flying ! 
Look at that ! 
There 's the cave . 
Your pursuit was so clumsy , I wasn 't sure you 'd ever catch up . 
Big talk for someone who 's outnumbered . 
Good thing I brought friends then . 
Oh yeah . I brought friends too . 
Hey , buddy . 
Awesome shooting there , Longshot . 
That was a mean swing , Pipsqueak . 
Nice moves . I had a feeling you knew how to handle yourself . 
- Really ? 
- Cool attack on that flamehead . 
Thanks , Pipsqueak . 
- He 's The Duke . I 'm Pipsqueak . 
It 's great to have a Waterbender on our side . 
Who are you people ? 
We 're the good guys . 
Where 's he taking him ? 
Don 't worry . Pipsqueak knows how to take out the garbage . 
You coming ? 
And if you add plates here and a vent here , all you need to do is install a bleed valve to regulate pressure . 
And you 're saying you implemented this with water-based transportation ? 
Well , no , it 's just an idea I had to make our ice-dodging ships more maneuverable . 
Very clever . Your father must be proud of you . 
Yeah , um , Dad doesn 't really pay attention to stuff like this . 
He 's got more important things to worry about . He 's a warrior . 
The world is filled with warriors . But there are far too few great engineers . 
Engineer ? 
No , this is just a hobby . 
My , uh ... my role is to protect the village and be a warrior , just like Dad . 
Protecting the ones we love is important , but I also know we must pursue the talents that we 've been given . 
Sokka , you 're a gifted engineer . Don 't ignore that . 
It 's not always easy to find your path in life , but when you find it , you must embrace it . 
People who saw the bombings also saw a burst of green flame . 
Tincar salt burns green . 
It 's a mineral tanners use to cure animal skins . They came up here to dig it out of the mountain . Just stuff I picked up from my dad . 
- He must be really proud of you . - I guess so . 
I think he sometimes wishes I was more like him . 
Don 't get me wrong . He 's incredible . 
After the Fire Nation attacked our village , he kept us alive . He built our life here . 
And you want him to do more . 
I want him to see that we have to do everything we can to save the world because if not us , then who ? 
Welcome . 
You live here ? 
We 've had a few bases , but this one 's served us well . Yeah ! Come on ! Firebenders haven 't been able to track us here . 
I still don 't understand what Firebenders are doing in the Earth Kingdom city . 
Well , Omashu isn 't what it used to be . 
In the old days , the city stood strong , but as the war dragged on , the king lost his nerve , grew tired , senile . 
Let corruption spring up all around him . Fire Nation seeped in through the cracks . 
So you just took it on yourselves to fight the Firebenders ? 
Well , if not us , then who ? 
Everyone here has lost someone to the Fire Nation . 
Families . Loved ones . 
We 're orphans , refugees . 
At least , that 's what we were . 
What are we now , Smellerbee ? 
Freedom fighters ! Yeah ! 
Someone was here recently . 
Here , look . 
If you mix tincar with salt water and then boil it down , you get this . Blasting jelly . 
A few jars could blow half the neighborhood sky-high . 
What is it ? What did you find ? 
The Firebenders weren 't behind the explosion . 
My mother was the fighter in our family . 
When the Fire Nation came to our village , she held them off while my dad hid me in a well . 
I wanted to fight , but ... he wouldn 't let me . 
I was eight . 
And when I came back up ... they were all gone . 
I know what it 's like to lose family too . 
It was quiet ... the night my mom died . 
Until the soldiers came . 
I try not to think about it . But recently , it 's been coming back to me . 
I think it 's been affecting my bending . 
I don 't know anything about bending , but I do know that you have to use everything inside you to help you fight . 
Tell me , what do you remember when you think of your mother ? 
I don 't mean how she died . I mean when she was alive . 
I remember her getting up every morning before everyone else . 
I remember seeing her outside the hut , getting to work , preparing breakfast . 
And every day , she would stop when the sun rose . She would watch it and smile . Every day . 
Remember that . 
Remember the sunrise . 
We don 't have to be afraid of our pain . 
- What are you doing ? 
- Trying some Omashu barbecue . It 's not often you get the opportunity . 
This is the great Omashu , the best the Earth Kingdom has to offer ? 
I gather its charms are lost on you . 
" Charm " ? You mean the dirt , the noise , the ... the stench ? 
- Thank you . - What happened there ? 
I 'm told that Fire Nation agents in the city have taken to sowing terror to weaken the Earthbenders ' resistance . 
That 's not right . Warriors don 't hide their faces in a fight . 
Father would never approve of this underhanded tactic . 
Given how long this war has lasted , who knows where true north lies in the Fire Nation ? 
It has come to my attention you are involved in a matter vital to the safety of our empire . 
I 'd be in your debt if you kept me informed on the progress of your mission , particularly as it relates to Prince Zuko . 
In return , I will keep in mind your loyalty and cooperation when the time comes for such debts to be paid , a time that may arrive sooner than expected . To the Flame Eternal . Princess Azula . 
Good news ? 
The best . 
It may have taken a while , Lt. Dang , but we are finally in the big game . 
You know the officer on Prince Zuko 's crew , the one who slipped you the information about the Avatar ? 
I 'd like to speak to him . 
- Sokka ! - Aang , check this out . 
Where 's Katara ? 
Uh , I haven 't seen her all day . I was helping Sai with his airship model . 
He just left to show it to the generals at the palace . Why ? What is it ? 
Teo and I found where the bombers have been getting their explosives . They 're making blasting jelly in a cave up on the mountain . 
Blasting jelly ? That 's not all . We also found these . The robes from the turnip cart . 
So it wasn 't the Firebenders behind the explosion ? It was ... You 're not gonna believe this . I know who 's behind the bombings . 
What ? 
- No , Jet 's not the bad guy . Sai is . - Are you kidding me ? 
Sai has done nothing but help us . Jet 's a con artist who lied to our faces . 
- He didn 't lie . - He didn 't tell the truth . 
Because he couldn 't ! 
He 's fighting the Firebenders , and he has to protect himself . 
You don 't know what he 's already lost . 
Besides , I saw Sai talking to the Firebender . He 's the traitor . 
You don 't know what you saw ! 
For all we know , Sai could be working with the king 's men to root out spies . 
He 's headed to the palace right now . He could be reporting everything . 
- You 're wrong ! - This is just like you , Katara ! 
Willing to believe anything as long as it helps you ! 
This is just like you ! Never believing anything I say ! 
I 'm sick of you treating me like I 'm a little girl ! 
Then grow up ! 
Where are you going ? 
To prove you 're a jerk ! Oh yeah ? 
Well , I don 't need proof for that ! 
- Would you like to try one of my ... - Not right now . 
Jet . 
- Listen , we need to talk . - Sure . Later . We just launched a big mission . Things might get hot for us around here . 
Mission ? What mission ? 
You were there when we confirmed the mechanist was a traitor . 
We took care of his partners . Now , I need to take care of him . 
Jet , what are you gonna do ? 
I told you . We know how to take out the garbage . 
- I 'm so sorry . - Oh , it 's fine . It 's fine . 
- I 'm so clumsy . Are you hurt ? - No . - No harm done . No harm done . 
You 're going to blow him up ? 
Not just him . He 's got an audience with the king . 
Sokka was right . You are the bad guy . 
Katara . 
The warehouse we destroyed , that was a meeting spot for spies . 
And by flushing them out , we got those three yesterday . 
The mechanist will help us root out even more evil . 
Innocent people are gonna die , Jet ! 
That 's the price of freedom . 
It 's too late ! 
There 's nothing you can do to stop it ! 
You were right . Shut up and gloat later . Right now , we need to stop Sai . Jet planted a bomb on him . 
What 's the fastest way to the palace ? 
It 's at the highest point in the city , so we need to ... 
This guy ? Again ? 
Go . Get to the palace and stop Sai . 
This is my fight . 
Keep your firebending in check , or you 'll have the Earth Kingdom Army to deal with . 
I don 't need fire to defeat this boy . 
Watch out ! Excuse me ! 
I have an idea . Come on . 
How dare you hit that child ? 
Sai said all routes lead to the palace . We have to take this one to the end of the line . 
The end of the line may be coming soon . 
Ready ? 
One , two , three ! 
Stand and fight ! For what ? Why is this so important to you ? 
You 're an enemy of the Fire Nation . 
And that 's it ? That 's why you 've been hunting me for three years ? 
How do you know it 's been three years ? 
Unless ... You have my notebook ! 
A Firebender ! A Firebender ! 
My ... my ... my cabbages ! 
Protect the king ! 
We must leave ! Now ! 
Find the Firebender , and close the gate ! 
- Go ! Save yourself ! - What ? 
For the Fire Nation !
