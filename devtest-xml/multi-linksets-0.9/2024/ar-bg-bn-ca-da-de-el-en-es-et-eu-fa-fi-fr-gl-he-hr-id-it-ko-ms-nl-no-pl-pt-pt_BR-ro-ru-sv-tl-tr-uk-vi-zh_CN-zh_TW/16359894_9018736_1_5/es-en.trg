Run ! 
- Get them ! - How many are there ? 
Five ? Six ? Maybe more ! Faster ! 
Let 's go ! Let 's go ! 
They 're getting away ! Hurry ! 
So ... ice discs ? That 's new ! It 's something I saw the Earthbenders do . Thought I 'd try a Waterbender version . 
Your bending has gotten really sharp . I mean , you 've been inventing new moves . That 's the mark of a skilled bender . 
I have been feeling pretty confident , but I 've learned everything I can from Gran Gran 's scroll , so what I really need is to get to the Northern Water Tribe . 
We 've been running into the Firebenders a lot more often . 
We 're getting closer to the Fire Nation border . It was bound to happen , even without Sokka 's tragic dating attempts . 
Hey , how was I supposed to know she was a Fire Nation soldier ? 
Look , we need to keep our guard up , at least until we get to the North , where the ... Aang ? 
Fire Nation . 
Why would they do this ? 
Why do they do anything ? 
This is all my fault . 
It 's the Avatar 's job to protect the natural world . That 's just as important as helping people and fighting Firebenders . 
How many more forests have died because I wasn 't here ? Because I don 't know what I 'm doing ? 
Gran Gran says ... life is a cycle . 
And out of death comes new life . 
This will be a forest again . 
That 's what you should see . 
Seeds for the future . 
Not past mistakes . 
No , it 's okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you . 
You lost ? 
Uh , my name 's Sokka . 
Rhymes with " okka " and " wakka wakka . " 
She looks very brave . She have a name ? 
Well , maybe we can come up with one for her . 
How about Pippinpaddle Oppsokopolis ? The third . 
Shi-yong made her for me . Shi-yong ? 
Is Shi-yong your friend , or is he ... Sokka ! 
No , wait . 
Over there . 
There you are . 
You know better than to wander off by yourself . 
Hey , she ... she dropped this . 
We 're not here to cause trouble . We ... 
She was just scared . 
Something bad happened here , didn 't it ? 
Please forgive my manners . 
- Thank you for helping my daughter . - No need to apologize . 
Living this close to the Fire Nation means you 've gotta stay on your guard . Yes . We have seen our share of war . 
Was that how the forest was destroyed ? A battle ? No . The Firebenders just wanted a clear path as they moved through the mountains . 
And that 's why they burned down the forest ? 
But after the fire , strange things started happening . 
Our crops started dying . Our ... our animals stopped grazing . 
A few days ago , we sent out an expedition to search for food . And they never came back . 
My son , Shi-yong , he was with them . 
We know what it is like to live in fear . But this , this is something deeper . 
It 's something beyond this world . 
You 're right . Your people are beyond this world . But I can get them back . 
Any news ? 
No , sir . 
Nothing ? 
How many places can there be for a giant sky bison to hide ? 
- And no reports of anything unusual ? - None . 
Except ... Except what ? 
One of the resupply merchants mentioned something about kids playing with ice blocks near Senlin Pass , but he was probably mistaken . 
So someone saw ice in a place where no ice should exist ? 
Most people would call that unusual , wouldn 't they , Lieutenant Jee ? 
- I 'll send some men to investigate . - No , I 'll have to do it myself . 
As always . 
Commander Zhao is very impressive ... working with no support in a forgotten little corner of the world , and yet he found the Avatar . 
I 've always admired how you manage your commanders . 
You always seem to know how to get the most out of their talents . 
Now , if it were me , I 'd send more resources to Zhao . 
" Water the most promising seeds . " You taught me that . 
You may be right . 
Tell Colonel Shinu to mobilize the archers . And alert the chancellor I 'll be redirecting some funds . 
And , Azula ... Zhao didn 't discover the Avatar . Zuko did . 
He 's the one who displayed resilience and dedication . That 's what I expect from a future heir . 
The world we live in isn 't the only world there is . 
There 's another realm beyond ours . 
The Spirit World . 
Usually , the two remain separate , but there are places where the barrier between them is thin . 
So you think the forest is one of these thin places ? 
I don 't think it . I feel it . 
And I believe the fires weaken the barrier even more . 
The Avatar is the bridge between the natural world and the Spirit World , and I can feel how close the two are . 
It 's like ice that 's started to crack . 
So you 're gonna hop into the Spirit World , grab the lost folks , and hop back . 
Something like that . Yeah . 
You sounded a lot more confident before . 
Because all of this is my responsibility . 
Yes , I need to get to the North so I can save the Waterbenders , but I also need to help these people so they don 't lose their homes and the ones they love the way I lost mine . 
It 's impossible for you to do everything . 
It 's like Bumi said , " The Avatar has to do the impossible . " 
I need to find where the spiritual energies are strongest . 
And where 's that ? 
I 'll know it when I find it . 
You almost said something specific . 
A shrine to the spirit of the forest . 
This is the place . 
So what do we do ? 
We watch over Aang . 
Once his spirit crosses over , his body will be vulnerable . 
We need to protect him . 
And how will we know that this works ? 
I 'm not sure . 
- I 'm getting hungry . - Hey , do you mind ? 
I 'm trying to concentrate here . 
Sokka , I think it worked . 
- What is happening ? 
- I don 't know ! Aang ? 
I 've separated my spirit from my body , but somehow , I brought you guys with me . 
How is that possible ? 
Must be the energies in the place and the thinness of the barrier and my power . 
Well , get us back ! Get us back now ! 
I 'm ... I 'm sorry . 
We 're in the Spirit World . 
Don 't mention the Avatar . We can 't let word get out . Agreed . And we should tread lightly . 
The Fire Nation may control this territory , but it 's still Earthbender country . 
- We don 't want to cause trouble . - When have I ever caused trouble ? 
When , indeed . 
I heard Waterbenders might 've been around these parts not long ago . - Did you see them ? 
- But you remember hearing about them . - Sort of . 
Perhaps this ... will help . 
Now , did you see the Waterbenders ? 
But I heard the Avatar might be traveling with some Waterbenders . 
- What did you say ? 
- The Avatar . He 's with some Waterbenders . Isn 't that right , Muki ? 
What ? The Avatar ? That 's what those pirates said . 
No , it wasn 't the pirates . It was that canyon guide . 
He said the Avatar fought off some canyon crawlers with the help of a couple Waterbenders . 
Was he the one who told us about how they stopped the volcano ... It seems they 've heard about the Avatar . 
Right after they fought the mad King of Omashu . 
I 'm gonna lose him . I 'm gonna lose everything ! 
If word has gotten to this backwoods hole , that means everyone knows . Everyone in the Earth Kingdom . Everyone in the Fire Nation . The hunters will be out . There 's blood in the water now . 
Help me ! She 's crazy ! 
Don 't die , you idiot . 
I only get half if you die . 
What are you looking at ? 
A low-life bounty hunter . 
Low-life ? Big talk for a little boy . 
I 'll let it pass ' cause your dad 's kinda cute . 
Should 've known they would 've let mercenaries run wild here . 
Gyatso used to tell me that the Spirit World and the physical world are tied together . 
What happens to one affects the other . It 's kinda like your soul and your body . 
Separate but connected . 
That makes sense . 
Gyatso had a way of making things easy to understand . He made everything easy . 
He sounds amazing . He was . 
You know , I 've always felt I was a spiritually-attuned person . 
- Might be why I crossed over with you . - Is that a frog or a froggy thing ? 
I have no idea how he got in here . 
The villagers are probably trying to find a way out . They 're probably looking for something familiar . 
Assuming they realize they don 't belong in here . 
None of you belong in here . 
Uh , who said that ? 
Who said what ? 
No human belongs in this realm . 
That is one big birdie . 
" Birdie " ? I am no birdie . 
I am the spirit of knowledge itself . 
Please excuse Sokka . He didn 't mean anything . 
- Aang , who are you talking to ? - What do you mean ? 
They do not hear what you hear . 
Their small minds are incapable of comprehending my speech . 
But I hear you . You are the Avatar . 
You were meant to have one foot in this world . 
They , however , are interlopers . 
And the longer they stay , the more dangerous it will become for them . 
Dangerous ? 
Dangerous ? The birdie 's not gonna eat us , is it ? 
That should be the least of his worries . 
There are creatures in here that will do far more than devour your body . They 'll eat your soul . 
Aang ? What 's he saying ? He says he 's not gonna hurt us . 
All we want is to find our missing friends , and we 'll get out of here . 
There is one who lives in a stone hut not far beyond the woods . He may know what 's become of your friends . 
Follow the path , and you will find him . Wait . Wait . What did you mean about danger ? 
What could happen to them ? 
There are things in here that will reveal truths to humans . 
Truths they 're never prepared to face . 
It will show them who they really are , and that can cause a great deal of pain . 
Farewell , Avatar , and remember , stay on the path . 
Bye-bye , Birdie . 
That 's enough . 
The lesson is over , Your Highness . Azula ! 
Are you okay ? 
Here , let me help you . 
Um , that was intense . Yeah . 
- You could 've hurt him . - That 's his fault . He should 've been better . 
Except this wasn 't about the trainer ... was it ? 
Azula , you 're the best . 
Everybody knows that . 
You 're perfect . 
That 's not good enough . 
There you are . Where have you been ? 
Apologies . I got distracted watching a game of Pai Sho . 
I 'm sure they are . Now let 's go . They didn 't follow the expected tactics , but that was their strength . 
Uncle , is there any chance you could finish this story on the boat ? 
Prince Zuko , there is much you can learn from these Pai Sho players . 
They are untrained , but that only means their minds are open to new ideas . 
And so they are ready when a solution reveals itself . 
June is the best at what she does , and that 's finding people . 
She 's a mercenary . Her loyalty is bought and sold . 
How can you trust someone like that ? 
June is a professional . 
Prince Zuko , I know you have always believed there is a right and a wrong way of doing things . 
It is a mark of a great leader , but the rules are different out here . 
Commander Zhao knows this , and he 's already making moves while we have yet to draw our tiles . 
So ... tell me about this Avatar . 
- Oh , did you see that ? - See what ? Did you see ... that ? 
Sokka , relax . The owl said we 'd be fine as long as we stuck to the path . 
Right , Aang ? Right . 
Aang ? What did the owl really say ? 
He said it could be dangerous for you guys in here . 
That you might have to face the truth . 
But how bad could the truth be , right ? 
Right . 
Yeah . Yeah , I can deal with the truth . 
You had to say something . 
Aang , please tell me that 's some spirit language only you can understand , and it 's saying , " Welcome , friends , would you like some cake ? " 
That 's not what it 's saying . 
Just stay on the path . The owl said it 'd be okay as long as we stay on the path . 
We 're on the path . 
We 're on the path ! We 're on the path ! 
Get off the path ! 
It 's the spirit of the forest . 
It 's wounded . 
I can 't bend . I can 't bend ! 
I can 't either . 
Look out ! 
Hey , skunky ! Why don 't you pick on someone your own size ? 
I ... I didn 't mean me . 
- Sokka ! 
Pain . Pain . 
So much pain . 
Actually , they 're just scratches . 
Not you . Hei Bai . 
Hey , what ? 
Hei Bai . That spirit . 
It 's in a lot of pain . 
I must 've landed harder than I thought . 
I 'm a little discombobulated . 
You 're funny . 
And you 're a talking fox . 
Then again , not the craziest thing I 've seen today . 
I need to get to my friends before they get eaten by that monster . 
It 's not a monster . It 's hurt . 
That 's what pain does to you . It changes you into something that you 're not . Don 't you know what it 's like to be hurt ? 
Well , these scratches are making me pretty irritable , so ... Do you always make jokes when you don 't wanna talk about something ? 
What ? That 's not what I do . 
You should go . I hope you can " recombobulate . " 
Spirit World . 
Oh , and be careful . 
The fog can be ... dangerous . 
- Mom ? 
- There you are . 
I 've been looking all over for you . 
This can 't be . 
- Is it really you ? 
- What ? 
Katara , are you okay ? 
It 's just been so long . 
Come on . We 're late . 
I 'm telling you , four strands is stronger . 
I didn 't say it wasn 't stronger . I said it was a waste . 
Katara , you 're not braiding . 
You know I was never good at this . 
Sokka used to tease me about ... Where 's Sokka ? 
He and your father should be back from their fishing expedition soon . 
Katara ... I can 't bend . You will . I know it . 
Someday , you are gonna show the world just how powerful you are . You will protect all of us . 
Fire Nation ! Run ! 
Hide her . 
- Find the Waterbender ! - Go ! 
Katara , we have to get inside now ! 
No , I 'm not going in there ! 
Hide . And whatever you do , don 't come out . 
Where 's the Waterbender ? 
We know you have one in the village . 
All the Waterbenders are gone or dead because of you . 
You 're lying . 
Turn the bender over . 
Or die . 
Wait ! 
It 's me . I 'm the Waterbender . 
So much fear . 
So much despair . 
Spirit World . More like mud world . 
It smells like Appa after a rainstorm . 
Well , that doesn 't seem right . 
Dad ? 
The spirits of water bear witness to this mark . 
For the strength and leadership displayed during his ice-dodging trials , I grant this Mark of the Wise ... to Sokka . To my son . 
This is the day of my ice-dodging trials . 
This is the day you passed your ice-dodging trials . 
Just as the warriors in our family always have . 
You did make it exciting though . 
Bato ! 
You were cutting it a little close around those icebergs , weren 't ya ? 
Yeah , that 's right . I lost control . I ... I didn 't know what to do . 
If you hadn 't have been on the boat and stepped in ... We all came through in one piece . 
That 's all that matters . Right , Hakoda ? 
Yes , that 's right , and selecting the right crew is part of being a wise leader . 
You see ? 
Why don 't you go find your sister ? And we can all celebrate . 
Hey , Sokka . We just saw your ice-dodging cutter or what remains of it . 
If this is how you pass a test , I 'd hate to see what you do to a boat when you fail . 
What a joke . 
I didn 't think he 'd get in trouble that quickly . 
If it weren 't for you , Sokka would have wrecked us . 
We 're lucky to be alive . 
It was tricky . Even I only saw the breakers at the last second . 
You don 't have to make excuses for him . 
I 'd hoped , when he really had to prove himself , that he 'd do ... better . 
The truth is , not everyone is meant to have people 's lives in their hands . 
Give in to your despair . 
Home . 
It isn 't real . It isn 't real . 
What have we here ? Someone who can resist ? 
That can 't be possible . Unless ... Ah , of course . 
It 's my old friend , the Avatar . 
Do I know you ? 
I should say so . 
Why would I try to kill you ? 
Oh , it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved . 
But you know all about stealing , don 't you ? 
Perhaps you 've come to return what you stole from me . 
I don 't know what you 're talking about . All I want is to find my friends . 
Your friends ? 
Now , why would I let you play with my food ? 
Aang ! You finally made it ! 
This isn 't ... this isn 't real . It can 't be . It 's another trick . It 's another illusion . 
I know it 's hard to believe , but ... it 's really me . 
There are lots of Illusions here , but you 've emerged from the fog . 
This is real . 
Recognize this ? 
One of the last games we played . 
Your turn . 
Cheater . 
I can 't believe it 's really you . 
How is this possible ? 
Well ... after you left the Southern Air Temple , the Firebenders attacked . 
It was sudden and swift . 
Most who perished moved on in the Great Cycle . 
I chose a different path . 
You chose not to move on to the next stage of enlightenment ? Why ? Because I knew you would need me . I do need you . 
I 'm supposed to be the Avatar , and everyone is counting on me , except I don 't know what I 'm doing . 
But now you 're here . 
Aang , I can 't tell you how to be the Avatar . 
Of course you can . 
Avatar Kyoshi told me that I need to get to the North to prevent a great tragedy from happening . 
Except ... I don 't know how . 
I don 't know anything . 
- You know a lot more than you think . 
- I doubt that . I mean , how am I supposed to save the world if I can 't even save ... my friends ? They 're somewhere in the fog . 
That is the Fog of Lost Souls . 
A place that imprisons people in their darkest memories , and it is the hunting ground for Koh , the face stealer . He preys on those paralyzed by despair and doubt . 
He must have the villagers too . The ones we came to rescue . 
Koh will have taken them to his lair . 
Koh will hold them there until he 's ready to feed . 
When that happens , their souls will be lost forever . 
I have to save them ! 
Koh is a primal spirit , a dangerous and ruthless predator . 
There is no way to defeat him . I have to try . 
I have to do something . 
Koh . He said that he knew me . That I 've taken something from him . 
It 's true . Previous Avatars have tangled with Koh . 
It 's said Roku once even got the best of the spirit , but nobody knows exactly what happened . 
Okay . Then ... I need to talk to Roku . 
I 've contacted Avatar Kyoshi at her shrine . I can do the same with Roku . 
Except Roku 's temple is in the Fire Nation . 
- It 'll be a dangerous journey . - I don 't have a choice . 
I 'll be back . 
There 's something I need to tell you . 
You ... couldn 't have done anything ... if you 'd stayed with us . 
You couldn 't have stopped the Fire Nation . 
You couldn 't have prevented the war . 
You would have just died along with everyone else . 
So ... let go . 
Can we talk about it when I get back ? 
Of course . 
You should hurry . Koh will feed again before too long . 
Right . Once I save my friends , we 'll have more time . 
Time . Time is a funny thing . 
There 's only one way to keep it straight . It 's by remembering what really matters . 
I hope you can help me , Avatar Roku . 
I know you 're in pain . I saw your spirit . 
I 'm gonna make this right , and I 'm gonna save my friends . 
I promise . 
Sorry , buddy . You can 't come this time . 
You too , Momo . 
It 's too dangerous . 
Keep them safe for me , okay ? 
Of course , keeping sight of what 's important can be hard . 
Sometimes it feels like we 'll always be alone . And the only thing keeping us company is our own pain . 
We tell ourselves we are the problem . 
Especially when things we can 't control come our way . 
That 's why we must let go of our pain and regret and remember what it is we 're really fighting for . The ones we love . 
Let that be the light that guides you through the most treacherous of times ... and the darkest of nights .
