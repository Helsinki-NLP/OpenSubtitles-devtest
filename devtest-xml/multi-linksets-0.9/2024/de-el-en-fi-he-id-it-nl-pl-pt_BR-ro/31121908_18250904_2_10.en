- Oh , my God . Duncan is dead . - What ? No , no one said that . 
Fingers crossed he pulls through . Yeah , fingers crossed . Most def . Okay . Lexi 's on her way to the hospital and Sam is going with her . I guess I 'll have to cover for them both . 
Give me that yogurt . - What ? - We 've got a paper to put out . 
Ugh , coconut ? 
[ sighs ] Be brave , Dennis . 
Mr. Rhodes , I am so sorry . 
It 's okay , Nell , because I think I understand completely what is going on . 
- You do ? 
- I 'm immortal , and you are a witch . 
Well , no . See , that 's not exactly it . 
Okay , then what is exactly it ? 
[ stutters ] I mean , how can I be in an ambulance on my way to the hospital while I 'm also here with you in an employee common area that smells like old paella ? 
Well , since I started writing obituaries , I see the ghosts of the people I 'm assigned . Maybe it 's genetic . My grandmother did see spirits , but she also talked to chickens . 
- Okay , let 's ... - I did prewrite your obituary . So that could be the reason why you 're here . 
- You must have so many questions . 
- Yes , I do . 
Why aren 't you rich ? 
I mean , I could think of a million ways you could take your power and turn it into an incredible financial gain . 
Do you know why I 'm not rich ? Huh ? 
Do you ? [ stammers ] You 're too tall . 
Would you like to know why I am not rich ? 
' Cause you sold this paper right from underneath us , and you didn 't even tell your daughter . Do you know how totally crushed she was ? 
She was on her way to confront you and tell you to stop , but then you died . 
You finally crack , you freak ? 
Not now , Mason . Okay ? 
I am trying to process my emotions about Mr. Rhodes . 
Right , right . Sorry . 
Um , let 's see . 
Boo-hoo . Ding-dong . The guy was a jerk . 
Freak . 
Wow . No feelings , no loyalty . 
- Now , that kid 's gonna be rich . - [ groans ] 
- Sam . 
- I beat ya . [ yelps ] 
I just heard about Duncan . 
- Come here . 
- It 's so horrible . 
Yeah , it 's complicated . 
Hey . Can you see me ? 
Am I transparent ? 
Can you see my face ? 
I just have to get to Lexi and make sure she 's okay . - Mm-hmm . 
- You know , I have her phone . I have her wallet . 
What else is she gonna need ? 
- [ gasps ] Her stapler . 
She 's gonna ... - Oh , no . Sam , no . I 'm sure they have one of these at the hospital . 
But that 's the one she learned on . 
Oh , Bangs is sad . 
It 's just that she 's been there for me through so much this year . 
I really want to be there for her right now . 
You know what , Sam ? I 'm gonna come with you . 
- Really ? - Yeah . - I think we should all go and see Lexi . - Great . - No , no . I 'm not going to the hospital . - Yes . 
I don 't wanna see my own body . 
It could put a rip in the space-time continuum . 
Dude , this is not Back to the Future . 
Hello ? 
Hello ? Where did he go ? 
- They stabilized Duncan . - [ gasps ] 
He 's at the hospital , and they 're prepping him for surgery . 
- Whoa , that is so weird . 
I mean , surgery is so weird . 
They cut you open , dig around . 
You know , if they touch something metal , your nose lights up . Just , " Ping ! " 
You don 't know what surgery is ? I do not have time to explain it to her . 
Half of the sports section didn 't show up . And now I have to figure out what the " playoff " is . 
Cheryl , banana . [ sighs ] [ groans ] Overripe . 
Be brave , Dennis . 
Edward . 
- How 's Lexi ? 
- She 's getting to know the nurses . Good . Good . 
I don 't see why I can 't look at my own father 's medical chart . 
Because it 's illegal and would be a HIPAA violation . 
Call me a hippo again and see what happens . 
She looks so stressed out . 
Why aren 't you doing anything ? 
I am . I 'm working 23 down . 
You 're doing a crossword ? 
Lexi needs you to , like , calm her , comfort her . 
- Yeah . 
- Okay , great . 
- Well , I 'm gonna go talk to her . 
- Here 's what we 're gonna do . Get color coded and alphabetical at the same time . 
Mandy , I know you look scared , but I promise you it will be worth it . 
Hey , sweetie , I 'm here . Can I get you anything ? 
Do you have a stapler ? 
I don 't know how to use this one . 
Do I have a stapler ? [ chuckles ] 
No , I don 't . Damn it , Nell . I 'm gonna check the gift shop . 
[ Nell ] Quentin . 
Hey , you still in your feelings , or did you cry it all out last night ? 
Nope . Nothing a hot shower and a continental breakfast at the DoubleTree couldn 't fix . - Hmm . 
- You ready for my interview , Quentin ? 
Gird your loins because my resume is gonna blow your nads off . 
Well , I 'll meet you in the conference room , Ms. Hercules . 
Why are you interviewing Tina ? 
And why did I not know her last name was Hercules ? 
Well , first off , you 're not a very good listener . - What ? - Second , there are a few openings at some of my company 's other holdings . I 'm culling the best candidates at the SoCal Independent . 
The best , huh ? 
Okay . I 'll go home and get my good blazer on . 
Unfortunately , you won 't be having any interview in any blazer . 
Is this because you accidentally called me Mommy ? 
I only called you Mommy because you gave me that super soft and warm blankie . 
- [ groans ] - No , that is not the reason . It 's because , as an obituary writer , your job is easily replaced by AI . 
- [ Duncan ] Yep . - [ yelps ] It 's definitely because he called you Mommy . 
You need to get an interview with that suit . 
- [ Dennis ] Nell ! - Huh ? 
Okay , Duncan is going into surgery . His heart 's gonna be outside his body for the next three to six hours . 
- Weird . 
- That 's also how much time I 'll need to fix Mason 's horoscopes because they all say , " Scopes , bruh . " 
- You . - [ grunts ] - [ grunts ] 
An interview ? 
Your heart is flopping around outside of your body and that 's what you 're worried about ? 
No , we gotta go and see Lexi . I 'm getting a clearer picture as to why your life is in shambles . 
You 're a squanderer . You squander . 
I do not squander . I am not a squanderer . 
I work very hard at this paper . Oh , please . Lots of people work hard . 
You have an incredible ability , yet you 've never used it for your own good . 
That is not how this works . 
No , that 's not how it 's been working , but now you have me , a titan of industry . 
Let me get you a job with that goober . Just get me in the room . 
[ scoffs ] You want me to use you to get a job ? 
That 's so selfish . 
- Is it really selfish , or is it smart ? 
And for all you know , I could be your last ghost . 
- Oh , my God , you 're right . - Exactly . 
So use me to do something meaningful for yourself . 
Fine . 
Quentin , I want an interview . And if you don 't give me one , I 'm gonna tell everybody that you suck your thumb . 
One in ten adults do it . 
I 'll see you in five minutes . 
Okay . Let 's not , uh , clean up too much . 
[ stutters ] It 's good . You look like you work at a car wash . 
Well , I 'm just saying if you 're too perfect , then the interviewer thinks you 're desperate . 
I am desperate . 
Do not say a word . 
The first person who speaks loses . 
Okay , let 's get started . 
What would you say is your biggest weakness ? 
Amateur hour . 
He 's trying to get you to diminish your skill set . 
Uh , pivot with a joke . 
My biggest weakness ? Tiramisu . [ chuckles ] 
Uh-huh . Not a great joke . 
This is what you gotta do . Uh , spread out . Take ... Take up more space . Show your dominance . 
Yeah , more . [ stutters ] More . More . 
More ... Okay , we 're not a gargoyle . 
All right . Uh , let 's start with some of our openings . 
No , no . You 're gonna lead the meeting . 
You tell him why he 's gonna hire you . 
Y-You know what ? Pace with me , Nell . Pace . 
Okay . Well , let me tell you why you should hire me . 
Stronger . 
Uh , a-and it 's not because of my years of experience or my investigative skills ... - Okay , curse . Curse . - ... or even because I 'm a damn , very damn , damn good writer . 
Yes , now get up in his face . 
You 're gonna hire me because I 'm bringing you journalistic expertise at a bargain price , and you are lucky to have it . 
Now , I want you to grab that pruney thumb and extend it upwards so that you show me you comprende . 
Yowza . I seriously underestimated you . 
You are far more qualified than I anticipated . 
We may just have some openings at our other holdings . 
Do not say a thing . You 're gonna walk out . 
We 're walking , and we 're not gonna look back . 
You did it . You did it , Nell . 
- Whoo ! - Look at me . - You 're about to get it . Get it . Oh , yeah . 
- I see you rocking it . 
- [ Duncan ] Here it is . Oh , my God . You were so right . 
I crushed it . Why haven 't I done this before ? 
That 's my girl . 
Yeah . Oh , wait . 
No , no , no , no , I am not your girl . No , Lexi is your girl . 
And I just realized that you haven 't asked once to go and see her . 
Lexi 's fine . 
Hey , let 's go to Caesar 's Palace . I can get into the bacchanal buffet . 
No . [ sighs ] 
You have an opportunity to see your daughter before you potentially die , and you 're here with me ? 
I 'm not the squanderer . You 're the squanderer . 
Don 't use my word against me , especially after all I did for you with the thumb-sucker . 
You told me to use this to help myself , but that 's not how it works . 
I use this to help you . And if you 're gonna be my last ghost , I 'm taking you to the hospital . 
I 'm not going to the hospital . 
You have no choice . You 're getting in my Prius . 
I 'm not getting into a Prius . 
Damn it . I 'm in a Prius . 
All right . Where 's Mandy ? Hello ? Does anyone have eyes on Mandy ? 
Hey , do you wanna take a break ? 
I got you some ... - ... balloons . - Thank you , Sam . 
Did she like the balloons ? 
- Thank you . 
- Hey , you know , is this really necessary ? 
I 'm sure Lexi 's probably fine . 
[ Lexi ] Mandy to the nurses ' station . I know you stole my Fresca . 
Mandy to the nurses ' station ! 
- Does she sound fine to you ? - No . Come on . 
You 're gonna use me to deliver a message to Lexi . 
This could be your last chance to fix your relationship . Look , Nell , the Rhodes family , you know , we 're not lovey-dovey , get-your-feelings-out type of family . 
We communicate with long periods of silence , sometimes lasting years . 
Well , we don 't have years . 
So tell me what you want me to tell Lexi . 
All right . Just tell her , uh ... [ stammers ] Start with , " Le " ... I got nothing . 
What do you mean you got nothing ? She 's your only daughter . You can 't be so cold and empty inside that you got nothing . 
What do you want me to say , huh ? 
That I messed up ? That I chose work over my family ? 
That we went her entire life without having a real conversation ? 
You think that 's gonna make her feel any better ? 
Well , when you put it like that ... [ nurse cries ] 
I don 't even know who that woman is . 
She 's crazy . [ cries ] I think that might be Mandy . 
Okay . I 'm loving that the napkins are in a basket . That is a good start . But it 's easier to kick cardiovascular disease when you add a little pizzazz . 
Could you please just look up from the crossword , at least ? 
She 's doing napkin origami over there . 
Impressive . 
So then you push it through , fan out the tail and voilà . 
Ugh , I can 't believe I have to do everything around this hospital myself . 
You know what ? Let 's take a deep breath with me , okay ? Let 's try that . 
In , two , three , four . 
We are running low on bedpans and need more type O-negative blood . 
- I can only donate so much , Sam . 
- Hey , real quick . 
What 's an eight-letter word for a cashmere shawl ? 
What does it matter ? 
Pashmina , which was also the name of my first albino pony . 
Huh . What about a six-letter word for director and star of Yentl ? 
Oh , Barbra . But only two As . She took away the middle one when she knew she was going to be famous . 
You 're really good at this . 
- Thank you . 
- You 're welcome . 
I think I 'm gonna check and see if there 's an update on my father . Okay . 
I , uh , get the crossword now . 
When I get overwhelmed , it helps me calm down if I have something to fixate on like my Rubik 's cube . 
And I know Lexi 's the same way . 
A puzzle with a solution . Small wins . 
Those things help us relax in situations we can 't really control . 
I see why the two of you are so good for each other . 
All right , let me try one . 
" Three-letter word for foe of dog . " I don 't know . " War " ? 
- That is correct . 
- Making five down " Wanada . " [ sighs ] Hey . 
Cricket , it 's so nice that you 're here . 
Well , honey , Duncan is a complicated man , but I want to be here for Lexi too . 
Plus , girl , that buffet spread is better than any hotel I 've been to . 
- Nothing . - So , how you doing , honey ? 
It 's a weird day . 
You know , with Duncan being in here and the paper being sold , it just ... 
- It 's made me think about a few things . 
- Aw . Well , tell me all about it while I eat this stuffed mushroom . 
[ Cricket ] Mmm . You know , I always thought that my job writing obituaries had value . 
I-I mean , not monetarily , because it doesn 't pay squat . But somehow because I 'm telling their last story , I was bringing closure to the person who died . But I don 't think I 'm impacting them at all . 
Well , of course not . 
Honey , they 're dead . 
Right . [ chuckles ] [ chuckling ] Obituaries are not really for the dead . They 're for the living . 
When Monty died , I felt so connected to him because of your obituary . 
It was like through you , I had one last conversation with him . 
- Yeah ? 
- Yeah . 
Nell , that is so special . 
Hey , how 's it going ? 
Oh , now that Mandy 's gone , we 've really gotten into a groove . 
That 's awesome . 
Maybe it 's a good time to take a walk with me . 
Ladies , I 'm taking my ten . 
- [ staff sighing , chatting ] 
So , I know you didn 't get a chance to talk to your dad before all this happened , and you had a lot of stuff that you wanted to say . So maybe you could say it to me instead . 
You 'll feel better . - That sounds dumb . - That sounds dumb . 
See what I 'm saying ? 
The ... The Rhodes , we don 't talk about our feelings . 
I get it . 
Rhodes don 't talk about their feelings . 
[ chuckles ] That 's exactly what my father would say . 
Oh , really ? Well , what would you say back ? I mean , pretend he 's here . 
Pretend he 's standing right next to me with a big dumb look on his face . Nice . All right , this is a waste of time . 
I promise it 's not a waste of time . 
Fine . 
I 'm upset he sold the paper without telling me . 
It makes me feel like he never thought I could run it in the first place . 
When he first gave me the paper , I was left with no resources , and he thought it would close in six months . 
I bought it as a write-off . 
- But I made it last for years . 
- Wow . I-I figured out a way to be resilient and never give up . 
It 's something I 've had to do my entire life , by the way . 
And he 's always seen me as someone who needs to be taken care of . 
He 's never seen the real me and everything that I can actually do . 
And look what you did . 
You built this paper and a beautiful community . 
I can 't believe they all came here for my father . They didn 't . They came here for you . 
And I have a feeling your dad would want to know the real you . 
I hope he pulls through so he gets the chance . - Yeah . - I do too , Lexi . 
We all chipped in to put out the paper early so we could be here . 
Actually , it was all me . 
I wanted to be generous , but they did nothing . 
Thank you . 
See , Duncan ? 
This is what I do for ghosts . 
Good news , everyone . 
The surgery was a success . 
- [ cheering ] - Father 's going to be okay . 
I 'm not crying . 
Life found a way . 
Enjoy the Rolex . 
Father ! You 're looking well . 
Oh , well , thank you . 
I had them do a little nip / tuck before popping the ticker back in . 
Oh , well , I 'm glad you pulled through . 
I have something important to tell you . 
Oh , really ? 
You figured out how you 're gonna spend all that money we got from selling the paper ? 
Uh , oh ! You 're gonna buy an Italian soccer team . 
Hmm ? Invest in a celebrity tequila . 
Go to space . 
Actually , I need to say something , but it 's hard . So I 'm just going to say it . 
I bought the paper . 
The new owner was selling it for parts , and I bought all the parts . 
I borrowed against my trust , liquidated my savings and refinanced my horse . 
And I 'm sure that you think it 's a bad investment and a terrible idea . 
No , actually , I don 't . 
- Really ? - Please . Talk me through the deal points . 
Sure . 
[ Nell ] Some people think a newspaper is just about the news , but it 's about so much more . 
When I first started writing obituaries , I thought my job was about reporting the facts . But as with all good storytelling , I discovered it 's really all about the people and their relationships to each other . 
It 's about the challenges they 've faced and how they 've risen to the occasion , how they 've become someone or something they never knew was possible . 
And to get two sheets together , you simply ... You see , you put it like that and look at this . They 're married now . 
With every obituary assignment , I 'm not just learning about other people 's lives , they 're also teaching me about mine . 
This job that once seemed like a burden has become so meaningful to me that I would even do it for free . 
" But I think we would both agree , in light of the new ownership , I definitely deserve a raise . 
Sincerely yours , Nell Serrano . " 
So , what do you think ? 
I love your little book report about your job . And I agree with all of it . 
- You do ? 
- Yes . Except for the raise part . 
I just sunk all of my money into this place . So it 's gonna be a hard no . 
But I 'm a damn , very damn , very damn , damn good journalist . And I 'm gonna convince you why you 're gonna change your mind . 
Oh , no . 
You don 't know who you 're dealing with . 
I could do this all day . 
My father started me young . 
Oh , hey . Oh , wow , you guys look huge . 
[ both ] Thank you . 
You 're welcome . 
So , boss lady , I hope you 're not so fancy that we can 't take you out to lunch . 
As much as I 'd love to , I already have lunch plans with our landlord . 
Hello , everybody . 
- It 's great to be back . 
- [ Jeremy ] Good morning , Mr. Rhodes . 
Ah , I can see you 're still getting dressed in the dark . 
Thank you , Mr. Rhodes . - Of course . 
- [ Lexi ] Hello , Father . I 'll be with you in a moment . 
Hey there , Mr. Rhodes . 
Oh , hello , Mel . 
Glad you 're back . 
How you feeling ? 
Pretty good for a guy who was technically dead and had his heart flopping around outside his body for several hours . 
Yeah , that must have been weird . 
Hey , quick question . Uh , seeing as I 'm the obituary writer and it 's kind of my jam , I was just wondering , do you remember anything during that time ? 
Or see anything or anybody ? 
No . 
No , not really . Uh , just everything went black . 
- You know , like I was in a void . 
- Uh-huh . [ chuckles ] Great . 
Except it was very tight . - Yeah . 
- And uncomfortable . 
That makes sense . Kind of like I was in a Prius . 
How would I know what that 's like ? 
Wait a minute . 
[ whispers ] What ? 
Since it 's a new day at the newspaper , I thought I would take the opportunity to rebrand with a more up-to-date , modern image . 
- Mmm . - Mmm . Love getting a makeover . 
- Yes , great idea . 
- Yeah . So , from today moving forward , our beloved SoCal Independent shall be known as the SoCool Independent ! 
I mean , it 's very similar to SoCal , just a little bit cooler . 
[ laughs ] What a difference an " oo " makes . 
So what do you think ? 
- Well , it doesn 't sound professional . - Or reputable . - Or real . 
Uh . [ scoffs ] Because it 's not ! 
[ chuckles ] - Goof ! 
[ laughing ] - Oh ! - Fun boss , get it ? 
- Oh ! 
Prank 's on you . - What a perfect prank . It was amazing . - You should 've seen your faces ! I just have to make a quick call . You gotta prank me next . 
I got you good . 
What a laugh . 
Take them down .
