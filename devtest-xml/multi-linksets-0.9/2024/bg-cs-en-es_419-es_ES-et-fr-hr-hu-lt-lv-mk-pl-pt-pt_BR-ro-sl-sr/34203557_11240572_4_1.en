I don 't believe it . It 's too simple . 
You wish it had been you ? 
Well , Agnes , now you 'll have to find a new purpose in life . 
Apparently , you are in need of an organ player . 
No one can know that I 'm alive , neither Mom nor Helen . 
There are still people in the world who hate me . You have to be careful . 
I have certain desires ... within me that , I can 't always tame . 
- Your son wants to kill me . 
- It was just a simple scuffle . 
Don 't move an inch ! 
There 's a camera there . Are you sure you want to call someone in ? 
Don 't struggle , and this won 't hurt . 
And now all we need is a confession . 
You know very well who killed Karolina . 
- How far along ? - One month . 
I 'm not your enemy . It 's them who are after your freedom . 
There 's no way in the world you would let my son go free . 
You 'll never get away from me . 
- Dad ? - Dad ! 
Police , don 't move ! 
- You 're under arrest , you dickhead . 
- How 's your girlfriend doing ? 
And where 's your father buried ? 
Where exactly is his grave ? 
- Coming ? Fuck . - Up ! Bring it up ! Evie ! Evie ! 
- I don 't believe you . - Stop ! Police ! 
How could you ? 
You don 't deserve to die . 
You lost . 
You have no longer have a family . 
Angel of God , guardian of mine , always be there at my side . Morning and evening , day and night , always guard me with thy might . 
Watch my body , watch my soul , and lead me to heavenly doors . Amen . 
Hurry up ! 
Move it . This is ain 't a spa ! 
The library 's rolled in here . 
- What is this ? 
- The book about angels you wanted . 
I asked for theological books , not stuff like this . 
That 's what they gave me for you . 
How about I go myself and show them what I need ? 
- You can cuff me if you want to . 
- No can do . 
There are other inmates in the library right now . 
I 'll be quiet . 
And then someone whacks our fucking star , and I lose my annual bonus ? 
Who needs that ? 
Don 't expect miracles . 
You guys did murder a guy so you could steal his car . 
Matthew Janik murdered him . 
I just failed to render aid . 
I was at the trial , I heard you . 
And the judge even believed you . 
You didn 't ? 
I was thanking God that Janik was still on the run and hadn 't testified , because you 'd get , I don 't know , twice as much . 
I got too much , anyway . 
What did you find ? 
They didn 't question the owner of the company car that was being used by the murder victim . 
They neglected the fact that the woman who found the body wasn 't really sober . And two witnesses were subpoenaed past the actual deadline . 
Is that enough to overturn it ? 
Well , it is if you have a good lawyer . 
A lawyer this expensive better be good . 
- When do I get out ? 
- I don 't know . 
I 'm going to file the motion next Monday . 
If it 's granted , the case begins all over , but that doesn 't necessarily mean you 'll get out . 
Then you better make sure I do . 
The prosecutor is still searching for grounds to charge you with other murders , as well . 
And if they can find new evidence , they might even go back to the case that was previously closed . 
They won 't find anything , because I 'm innocent . 
- I 'll be filing the motion next week . 
- Try harder . 
It 's boring in here . 
You 're free now . 
So , where to now ? 
The Maldives , Zanzibar ? 
I might just surprise you . 
Would you like more tea ? 
Thanks . 
Try it , it 's delish . 
My brother-in-law is hiring at his store . 
I can put in a word for you . 
Thanks , I 'd prefer something farther . 
Here in Silver Mountain , people talk way too much . 
- They 'll stop , eventually . - I don 't know . 
I 've had enough . That 's why I moved to the woods . 
Open a pastry shop and sell pies . They 're really good . 
You have to eat all of it . And I have to lose weight for the beach . 
And Matthew ? 
Any word from him ? No . 
I don 't even know if he 's alive . 
Maybe it 'd be better if he wasn 't . 
Come on now . He 's your son . 
He took a shot at me . 
And all the things he said ... 
I don 't have a son anymore . 
They told us to keep an eye on you . You know , in case Matthew comes back . 
- Well , I 'll just say ... we won 't be trying too hard . 
- We know and respect each other . 
- Thanks . 
What is that for ? 
In case you decide to rat me out . 
Look , don 't be stupid . 
Give it to me . 
You know they 'd lock me up if they found a gun here . 
- Police freeze ! 
- Hands in the air ! Drop it ! Drop your weapon ! 
- Put it down ! 
- Drop your weapon ! 
Stop ! 
Leave it ! 
I said leave it ! Don 't touch it . 
Get the fuck out . 
- Password . 
- Fuck you . 
Password ! 
Four two six seven . 
- That guy . 
- Collar him . 
- What ? It 's self-defense . 
- Come . 
In a second . 
Dude , I told you I don 't know who brought the drugs . 
Maybe the girls you 're forcing into sex work ? 
I 'm not forcing anyone . They 're all in for it . 
Yeah ? 
Can you step out here for a moment ? 
Mother superior . 
Now I understand. why you have it in for him , you two are a match . 
I need to lean on him . 
That 's fine , I need to find a stroller for my baby , anyway . 
Or you could just step outside and see if maybe Suzin is coming back ? 
What 's this about ? 
I need to lean on the guy . But I 'll be gentle , I promise you . 
Okay . 
Oh , man . Here comes the bad cop . 
- I believe that 's illegal . 
- You like cameras , don 't you ? 
Your buddies say you 've got them placed all around your house and that you record all your guests . 
I need a recording which , unfortunately , is not on your computer . 
Then you 've got a problem . 
Maybe I do . But I 've also got an offer . 
Either I can break your other hand today ... or I can just let you go . 
How about New Zealand ? 
You 're right , it 's too far , I know . 
- What about The Canary Islands ? 
There 's black beaches , volcanoes ... Think about it . 
I don 't want to go anywhere . 
Helen , what 's wrong with you ? 
It 's a vacation , it 's just three weeks . 
- Does dad know ? 
Did you tell dad that it 's just vacations ? 
I don 't need to ask him , - it 's none of his business . 
- What if he wants to stop us , again ? 
Helen ... Dad 's in prison , we are safe now . 
He 'll come up with something . 
Why would you say that ? 
Dad will always find us . And we won 't get away from him . 
First day without the GPS . 
This calls for a drink . 
Cheers . 
What are you going to do ? 
I told you . Wolnicki gave me a job . 
I 'm just waiting for a signal , for when to start . 
Son , he 's the reason behind our problems . 
- Why would you do that ? 
- Because he 'll pay me . 
And you trust him ? 
You 're so pathetic . 
What are you gonna be doing for him ? 
I 'm gonna be killing bitches . 
You know you don 't have to do that . 
I want to . 
And it 's none of your fucking business ! 
And while doing it ... I 'll be thinking of you . 
Now ... Stay put . 
- Hi , sis . 
Yeah , hi . 
To what do I owe the honor ? 
To the fact that I miss you ? So do the kids . 
Jesus , it 's been ages , they must be taller than me by now , right ? 
Yeah , Johnny is for sure . 
Listen ... um ... I need a favor , uh ... 
Can we meet up soon ? 
- Meaning , you want to come here ? 
- Would that be alright with you ? 
Well ... sure . 
- Great , see you soon then . 
Three minutes . 
How can I help you ? 
I know that you gave Matthew a job to do . 
Call it off . 
I can do you a world of harm . I 've still got contacts in the police . 
I 'll make sure you never get out of here . 
Come on , please , don 't do that . 
You 'll leave Matthew a voice message ... saying that the job is canceled and he 's free . And that you won 't pay him . 
I will help you . 
I 'll get you a shorter sentence . 
And can you really do that for me ? 
Yes . 
Go on . 
I have no idea what Matthew is planning . And I haven 't given him any job to do . 
But if you know of his whereabouts , you need to report it to the police . 
He 's a wanted fugitive . 
Stop it , I beg you . 
Set him free , don 't drag him deeper into this shit . 
Please , I 'll pay you ! 
Leave my son alone . I know you understand , 
I know that you 've got kids , too . 
I know how you feel . I do . 
The pain of failing as a parent is ... the worst . 
But I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . 
I 'll be released very soon . 
I 'll visit you . I have to repay you for your hospitality somehow . 
Nice place . 
Have you been here before ? 
I wonder what 's good here . 
I haven 't eaten all day . - There you go . - Oh . 
Octopus in wine . 
What ? 
I 'd like for you to move out . 
I don 't understand . Monika ... I know your life was messed up . 
Peter , the kids , all that ... You think that ... you don 't deserve to be happy , but I love you . 
But I don 't love you . 
I don 't love you . 
I 'm not sleeping at home tonight . 
Please , pack your stuff and move out . 
Could you at least let me say goodbye to the kids ? 
They 're not there . They 're at my sister 's . 
- Who is it ? 
- What ? They guy you 're spending the night with . 
You don 't know him . 
Hello , there ? 
Is something wrong ? 
What kind of surprise is this ? 
What 's been my promise in the past year ? 
A puppy ? 
But you said we couldn 't have one ! 
It 's so cute ! And sweet ! 
- This is so great . 
- Look at those eyes . 
- And how big will it get ? 
- I don 't know , we 'll see . 
Look at its nose . 
Did you see its paws ? 
- How will we name it ? 
- Hmm ... Well , let 's see ... - How about ... 
- Thank you , Mum ! 
- How about Spots ? - Maybe . 
- End of the trip . - What ? 
- I 've got a meeting with my lawyer . 
- She couldn 't make it . 
She 's on the phone . 
This wasn 't the deal . You were supposed to come , what 's going on ? 
- What 's with the appeal ? 
- I 've checked all the options , there 's no chance for overturning the verdict . It won 't work . 
Then you will have to try harder , won 't you ? 
There 's nothing else I can do , you have to do your time . I 'm sorry . 
Are you happy ? 
You snorted coke in minute two , and took cash for a bribe in minute five . 
Hold on . How do I know you didn 't make a copy ? 
You don 't . 
Ms. Polkowska ! What a coincidence . 
I really believed you left Wolnicki behind and you 're chasing other criminals . 
But now I see that you haven 't . 
You 're digging up dirt on his lawyer . Why is that ? At least he won 't move to overturn the verdict . 
He 'll find some other lawyer to do it . 
Don 't you get it ? 
The man can 't get out even for one hour ! 
That 's for the court and prosecutor to decide , understand ? 
Screw a court system that just serves criminals ! 
I cannot let that freak get out and kill someone again . 
Where does this end ? 
When Wolnicki gets a life sentence . 
You 'll still hunt him anyway . Even after he 's dead . 
Okay , you can go snitch on me . 
Now beat it . 
Matthew . 
Matthew ? 
Where were you ? 
I swear I haven 't told anyone that you 're here . Tell me . 
Tell me where you were . 
- I just want to help you . I just ... 
- Tell me ! 
I love you , son . I 'd never betray you . 
And you 'll never kill me . 
Who did you bring here , huh ? 
Matthew ? 
I 've come to help you . 
Put that down , Son . 
Can we just talk it out ? 
Dad . 
Unbelievable . 
This drunk used to beat you and you ask him for help ? 
Is that how fucked up you are ? 
- He 's changed , listen to him . 
- Matthew ... You are my son . I know how you feel . 
I 've also had that in me . This rage , that 's the reason why I drank . 
But there 's nothing that can 't be fixed . 
Listen to him ! 
- He 'll help you , he will . 
- Thank you , Mum . I had one dream , and you just made it come true . 
I always wanted to fucking kill him . 
So what ? 
Are you going to kill me ? 
No . I 'll just fuck you up , like back in the day . 
Just leave him alone . It 's not like you 'll shoot him ! 
And a big hand for Wlodek ! 
A toast ! Mrowiec , Mrowiec . 
My friends . Dear friends ! I came to you only six months ago to lead a task force . 
And then I was asked to stay and replace your boss , who went on leave . 
Through all that time I was aware that there 's one thought going through all of your heads . 
What 's that old fucker from Opole doing here ? 
Sense of humor : 1000 ! 
That 's why , my dears ... Yeah , yeah . ... I 'm gonna grant your wish ! 
I 'm off to Opole ! 
Go ahead and get drunk on me tonight . 
- Cheers everyone ! - Cheers ! 
Wlodek ! Wlodek ! For he 's a jolly good fellow ... 
Guys , please ... For he 's a jolly good fellow ... 
Hi , honey . How did it go yesterday ? 
Yesterday ? 
At the job interview . 
Oh , that . I didn 't go . 
I didn 't think it was for me . 
Why ? Is there something wrong ? 
No , everything 's fine . I just caught a cold yesterday . 
Hello , Her Majesty ! 
I need to go , uh ... Take care , guys , bye . 
Jola ... 
- You scared her off . 
- Oh . The poor high Bambi . 
What ? 
Drugs are something I know , she 's high . You don 't know shit about anything , alright ? 
That 's right . 
You can 't even buy a stroller . 
- He thought the bassinet was a boat . 
- Please , can 't we have just one ? 
No , we can 't have one for both of us . Because you 'll wreck it and then I won 't have one . 
But you 're not worried I might wreck the baby . That doesn 't come with a warranty . Because they 'd lock you up for the baby , but not for the stroller . 
Oh , and all the days would be yours . 
You really want to share custody right after the baby 's born ? 
- It might not work . 
- Yeah , thanks so much for the advice . 
Then how did you do it ? 
Did you hit the bottle at the maternity ward or did you wait ? 
Aggie ! 
Can we talk for a second ? 
In private . Alright . 
You snitched , traitor . 
What is it ? 
I talked to the chief commissioner about you . 
Should I pack up ? 
You can put it that way . 
He asked who I 'd recommend as my replacement . 
- What ? The prick 's not coming back ? 
I don 't know . Who did you recommend ? 
No ... No . No . 
- No . - So it 's a yes , then ? 
No , you 're out of your mind . 
You know your colleagues praise you . - Yeah ? Which ones ? Mrowiec , too ? - Especially him . Oh , what did he say ? 
That it 's the last chance to make a human being out of you . 
- What 's wrong , Evelin ? 
What 's - - - Oh , fuck ... 
Oh , fuck . Don 't move , okay ? 
- Get a doctor ! - Boss ! Boss ! Please , can we ride blues and twos to the hospital ? 
Guys , my baby is on the way ! 
Make sure you wipe your prints . 
There 's the casing . 
And now ... Have you seen the bullet ? 
She 's dead . She 's gone . 
We need to clean this mess up . Okay ? Did she stash a gun somewhere ? 
In the cabinet . 
Maybe they 'll believe she offed herself . 
I need that bullet , Matthew ... 
Matthew ? 
Hi , this is Barb . I wanted to know if Monica was with you ? 
I can 't get a hold of her , and I wanted to ask her about Helen 's meds . 
No . Didn 't she tell you ? 
Yeah , I know , a romantic getaway . I know . 
Not with me , though . 
We broke up . 
- So what is she doing ? 
- No idea . 
You know , she gave me those papers ... and she said it was just in case I needed ... ? 
What papers ? 
Papers concerning custody over the children . 
Wolnicki ! A visit . 
- My lawyer ? - No . 
A surprise . 
Your wife 's here . 
You 'll release a load in the wet cell . 
- My wife , Monika ? 
- Yep . She 's clearly craving . 
I 'll chat her up if you don 't want to . 
Have fun . 
Did you miss me ? 
What do you want ? 
We wanted to go for a holiday , but ... Helen was afraid that you 'd mind if we did . 
What a sweet kid . 
Bring her to me someday , would you ? 
She won 't come , she 's afraid of you . 
Because you 've turned her against me . 
- You 're lying to my children . 
- Stop it . 
I don 't wanna talk . 
What do you want ? 
To be free from you . 
You 've succeeded at that . 
You 'll be out , eventually . 
You 'll come up with something , as always . 
We could move to the other side of the world , and ... you 'll find us anyway . 
You can 't stop me from doing that . 
I can . 
Hardcore . 
Step away ! 
Go get a doctor ! 
We 've been informed that this morning Peter Wolnicki , a controversial writer and a scholar suspected of murdering young women , has been brutally assaulted by his wife , who was visiting him at the penitentiary . 
Wolnicki has been ... Once again , thanks a lot . 
Check it out , we made ourselves a little human . 
An awesome one . 
Wolnicki 's wife mutilated him with a chair in prison . 
- So did she beat him to death ? 
- Unfortunately not . 
But he 's got serious brain injuries . The doctors are fighting for his life . 
Maybe they won 't try too hard . 
Excuse me . 
He fucking got away , again . 
It 's difficult to say what state Wolnicki will be in , or if he will survive the surgery at all . But it is not likely that he will return to the penitentiary any time soon . 
Good morning . 
- Good morning , dear Dr. Judith ! 
- Good morning to you , Henry . 
Say hi to our dear Peter ! 
I 'll come for a chat soon , tell him all about my furlough ! 
I 'll say hi for you , he 'll be happy to hear that . 
You 'll have a chat with Peter . Yeah , right . 
- Hello . 
Good morning . 
How are you doing today ? 
Henry says hi . 
We 'll do mouth exercises today . 
But first things first , just as you like it . 
Angel of God , guardian of mine , always be there at my side . Morning and evening , day and night , always guard me with thy might . 
Watch my body , watch my soul , and then lead me to heavenly doors . Amen .
