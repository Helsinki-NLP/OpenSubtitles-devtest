I 'm sorry , Miss . If you 're here for office hours , mine are Tuesday night , and I 'm afraid you 've missed Dr. Cornwall 's by ... 13 years . 
It 's me , dummy . 
Roz ! 
What are you doing in Boston ? 
Well , you know Alice started grad school in Providence . 
- Brown ? - RISD . 
She 'll be okay . 
Anyway , she broke up with her boyfriend , so I came out to see her tonight , and she canceled on me at the last minute ' cause she has a date . 
Wait a minute , your daughter blew you off for a guy ? 
Well as a friend , I 'm sorry to hear that , but as a firm believer in behavioral genetics , I 'm thrilled . 
How do I look ? Rich . 
Just what I was going for . 
- Roz . - Hey . 
- Hey , Roz . 
- Hey . Thank you so much for letting me tag along . 
Well , hold onto your hat , it 's gonna be a real barn burner tonight . 
- We 'll start with cocktails here . - Okay . 
And then the five of us will be heading to Boston 's most exclusive ... - ... late night ... - All right . ... art gallery opening for newly named MacArthur Genius Vincente Ennui for his work in charting America 's decline through the tectonic shifts in interior decor . 
Maybe I 'll catch an early flight home . 
No , no , no , no . Come on , it 'll be fun . 
Well , maybe not fun , but , come on , it 'll be . 
Wait , Freddy , are you going to this ? 
This doesn 't seem like you . 
Yeah , no , I just met one of the bartenders working the event . 
We 're so compatible . It 's crazy . 
Like , I 'm a libra , she has box seats at Fenway . 
And the art history department will be there . 
The most attractive department on campus . 
Their haircuts are so angular . 
It 's an artsy crowd , but ... I refuse to be sidelined as a stodgy stuffed shirt with some boorishly folded pocket square . Here . Now ... that says " free spirit , " doesn 't it ? 
Them I get , but you , Olivia ? 
Look , I know it sounds terrible ... Maybe I call it early . 
Might be nice just to have a free night instead . 
Ooh , a free night . 
I just had a dream about one of those . 
I dreamt that I got off my shift early , and then someone got me a Diet Coke , just because . 
That 's terrible . Don 't you take time for yourself ? Please . 
I see her at the bar all the time . 
I work there . 
Hold on , Eve . 
You are surrounded by capable men . 
They must help you out with the baby all the time . 
They help with John plenty . 
Here you go . Yeah . 
They really can be so thoughtful . 
It 'd be so easy for them to pass the ... buck , but they 're always happy to lend a helping ... 
Yeah , okay . Thanks , fellas . 
Look , I 'm-I 'm fine . I 'm gonna take John home . Would I like some more free time ? Sure . 
Would I , like to go to the dentist every couple years ? 
Who doesn 't ? 
It 's okay , sweetheart , it 's okay . 
That 's it , Eve . 
You and I are going out , and I am going to give you the girls ' night that you deserve . 
- Girls ' night ? - What about the art gallery ? 
Yeah , and I don 't have a sitter . 
That 's why these gentlemen are going to happily watch him for you . - ... 
I don 't ... - Is it even legal for us to look after a baby ? 
You 're watching the baby tonight . 
This woman needs a break . Look at her . 
She 's a wreck . - I don 't know about wreck . 
- She looks like hell . 
This is my most expensive top . 
You three men ... Really ? That is your most expen ... 
You 're helping tonight , and that 's that . 
Eve , come on , let 's get you dressed . 
Okay ... 
He needs to be in his crib by 8 : 00 , and call me if you need anything . 
girls ' night ? 
Haven 't had one of those in a while . 
It 's usually just me and those two grumpy Muppets over there . 
Would you like to join us ? 
Yes , I really would . No take-backs . 
Well , this is a disaster . 
All right , I 'm just gonna take this guy out , let him crawl around on the rug . No . No . Not on my expensive , hand-woven rug . 
This place is entirely too dangerous for a baby . 
This is much better for a baby . 
There 's no reason why we should all lose our evenings . We just need one person to stay at home and supervise . 
Well , I can 't miss a gallery opening just because of a baby . 
I did that with Freddy . I swore it 'd never happen again . 
And like I said , I 'm meeting this bartender . 
Yes , Lady Fenway . 
Dad . She has a name . 
She definitely has a name . 
Alan , why can 't you take him ? 
Dear God . 
You can 't hiss at a baby . 
Right , well , I 'm disqualified . 
Really , why can 't you take him ? 
Well , it 's more complicated than it seems . 
Also , and not to be discounted , I don 't want to . 
All right , all right . Th-There 's got to be some sort of a solution . 
Well , King Solomon would suggest ... No ! 
My gosh . This baby is so cute . Whose is he ? 
Well , we 're all pitching in to watch him . 
Well , what a bunch of sweethearts . 
Table nine saw you watching this little fella and sent over squash blossoms . 
You guys are heroes . 
This is fascinating . 
I 've seen women in this very bar caring for a baby to no applause , and yet , we turn up with a child , and suddenly everybody loves us . 
God , it 's a shameful double standard . 
Really , really cool . 
You know ... we could just go to the gallery , we could take John with us , and ... to ensure that you gentlemen have a lovely evening , 
No , no , no , no , Dad , Dad , Dad , I can 't let you do it . 
You 've done so much already . 
Please , let me . 
I 'll watch ... What you 're doing is so transparent . 
For shame . 
A round on the house . 
I shall look after the baby . 
You just hissed at the baby . 
Well , look , we 've only had him five minutes , I 've already got a free drink . 
By my calculations , if I spend a three-hour evening with John , I 'll have ... I 'll have died . 
Please , let me take him . For God 's sakes , I mean , he 's better than the perfect pocket square . 
- No , Dad , the Sox could go all the way this year . - Let me at least get a refill . All right , all right , all right . 
I have it . - We will timeshare the baby . - Of course . 
That 's-that 's genius . Wait , wait . 
Isn 't John supposed to be in his crib by 8 : 00 ? 
True , but if he 's in his crib , then he can 't be exposed to arts and culture . 
Yes , that is most important to expose them during the early years , or something like that . 
Let 's do this . For John ! 
It 's really good . 
I 'm usually stuck with stuffy academics . 
It 's so nice to be out with the girls . 
All right . Let 's get nasty . 
Honest thoughts about 17th-century poet Anne Bradstreet ? 
Go . Who ? Exactly . 
We 're so bad . 
So what kind of trouble do you want to get into next ? 
Probably the kind of trouble that wraps up by 10 : 30 . 
Come on . I remember what it was like raising Alice . 
Got to vent some of that single mom frustration . 
Yeah , we can 't end the night yet . We haven 't even named our group chat . 
Ooh , " Text and the City . " 
Nah , we 're better than that . 
I love being out with you guys , but I just feel bad that I left the guys with John . 
They had this big night out planned . They 're probably miserable . 
It 's not easy being a full-time professor and looking after this cherub at the same time . 
I do my best . 
I do my best . 
This is my son . 
- Excuse me . Sorry . 
- It does take a village . Sorry about that , just had to change this little guy . 
- You are so sweet . - Well ... 
I can 't believe you watch him almost every night . Yeah . 
Neither can I. 
Although , my evenings are gonna start freeing up around , April ninth . 
That 's opening day at Fenway . 
Is it ? 
I don 't want to put the guys out . Maybe we call it a night . 
Don 't worry about them . This is your chance to cut loose , you know ? 
Get a guy 's number , do a flaming shot , wake up on a boat with a sailor who only speaks Cantonese . 
That is way too specific to be made-up . 
How about I do one of those things , then we call it a night ? 
- Deal . 
- Coward . 
We 're gonna get you a guy 's number . 
I know this cool spot . 
It 's an immersive theater where the actors interact with the audience . 
Is there any possible chance those are fancy words for " male strip club " ? 
It 's a great spot , I promise . 
There 's an illegal speakeasy in the back . It 's wild . 
Okay , let 's go break some rules and get some numbers and get this mom rage out . 
Road Dogs , load up . 
I 'll keep playing with it . 
- This is great . - Yeah . This has turned out to be a lot easier than I would 've thought . 
Yeah , having a baby is easy . Where 's the baby ? 
I thought you had him . 
I came over ' cause it 's my turn with John . Wait ... All right , all right , let 's not panic . 
John . - Dad , he 's not a lost pet . 
You know what ? Calm down . I 'm a firefighter , I 'm good under pressure . Okay . Hi . 
Excuse me . Have you , have you seen a baby ? Please help me . I am freaking out . 
Relax , here we are . Don 't worry . 
Alan ... 
That 's not our baby . Relax . 
I offered to look after Professor Columbus 's child for a moment , that 's all . 
Thank you . 
And I must say , Alan , your grandson is adorable . 
Well , he takes after his Pop Pop . 
Pop Pop ? 
Back at the bar , you were hissing at the baby . Now you 're taking care of two of them , and there 's not even a free drink involved . What are you up to ? What sick game are you playing ? This has gone too far . 
John was supposed to be in his crib hours ago . 
We need to take him home . - Yes , Freddy 's right . 
- No , no , no , we can 't go yet . And why not ? 
I 'm saying , we can 't just give up . 
Did we give up in India ? Did we give up in Hong Kong ? 
Did we give up in Ireland ? 
Did we give up in Nigeria ? Canada ? 
Boston ? 
Yes , in all those places . 
But not straight away . 
Now , look , if we can 't have John , we can still enjoy the idea of John . 
Gentlemen , I present to you Schr√∂dinger 's Baby . 
What the hell happened ? 
My theater used to be right here . 
Well , now it 's a Kaptain Kebab 's . 
" Boston 's second-finest nautical Middle Eastern fusion . " 
Why would they advertise that ? 
This is the worst . 
Okay , which guys ' number here are you going to get ? What ? We 're still doing that ? - Yeah . - I don 't know , I think it 's a sign . Maybe we should call it . 
No , it 's a sign you gotta keep going . 
I remember what it was like to be a single mother . 
You 've got to take time for yourself . Otherwise , you wake up and your favorite theater ... Has a C + health rating . 
I 'd really rather not talk to anyone here . - Hey , you . 
Come here . - Yes ? - Give her your number - Can do . 
I don 't want this guy 's number . 
- Not a problem . - Take his number . 
- Terry , by the way . 
Hi . - Hi . 
No , I 'm not that desperate . - None taken . 
- That 's not what I meant , Terry . 
- I shouldn 't have assumed . - Well , if you don 't want it , 
- I 'll take his number . - I 'm open to that . - No , only Eve . - Sounds good . 
- Terry , you should go . - On my way . 
- Terry , you should stay right where you are . - Nowhere to be . 
Shoo , get out of here . Roger that . 
Happy Friday , everyone . 
Why won 't you let me help you ? 
You need this . 
It actually seems like you need this . 
What is that supposed to mean ? 
Your daughter 's in grad school , she bailed on you for a date . You 're feeling a little adrift and unneeded , so you 're dumping all that energy onto me as a way of feeling necessary to someone . 
I 'm just gonna leave my number right here . 
Call me if any of you would like a date , or an above-ground pool heater . 
I do my best . I do my best . 
You 're so good with that baby . 
I know . Can I get one little peek ? 
No . 
And my soothing baritone can even lull the baby to sleep . Do you hear that ? 
It 's the sound of success . 
I 'm sorry . 
- No , I 'm sorry . 
- No , I 'm sorry . What are you sorry for ? 
I don 't know , I just wanted to fit in . 
Look , you were right . I-I ... I was so upset Alice didn 't need me , so I just got up all in your life instead . 
It 's okay . 
Yes , I do wish I had more help in my life , but it 's not like I need to get it all out or anything . 
It does get overwhelming . 
How did you balance it all ? 
Screw balance . That 's a myth . You just hang on for dear life , and suddenly they 're grown and you 're desperate to get the chaos back . 
Yeah , nobody 's good at balance . 
I have a confession . I do not have many female friends outside of school . - What ? You ? 
- I find that very surprising . That 's why tonight was so much fun for me . 
Okay . You know what ? Those guys can watch John a little longer . 
Let 's go check out the art gallery . - Yes . - Road Dogs , load up . 
You used our name ! 
We still need to workshop it a little bit . 
Well , gentlemen , that was one hell of an evening . 
- To three men and their baby . - Yeah . 
Okay , what do you think ? We quit while we 're ahead ? 
- Yes , let 's get out of here . Come on . - Okay . 
What the hell ? 
You have my baby here past 11 : 00 ? No , no , no , no . It 's actually much worse than that . 
Alan , I hope you 've made peace with whatever British God you worship , because if that isn 't my baby , I 'm gonna kill you . 
My God , they traded your baby for wine ! 
Do you really think we would trade John for white zinfandel ? 
Or any wine ? 
I can explain . We just took John home . He 's safe and sound , asleep with David . 
You just took him home ? 
Then why is all his stuff still here ? 
So that they could pick up chicks . 
I should come clean , too . 
I lied about having box seats at Fenway . 
You what ? ! 
Hold on . So you took John home two hours past his bedtime ? And you took credit for raising him ? 
Are you kidding me ? ! 
I never ask for anything ! But what should I expect ? I 'm raising a child alone . 
I wait tables almost every single night . Most of what I make goes to the babysitter . 
Yes , I don 't pay rent . Thank you so much for that . 
But you 're , what , a multi-multimillionaire ? 
Well , most of it 's tied up in assets . 
I barely get any help these days , and I asked for one damn night off , and you all can 't even do that . 
And I 'm not quite sure you 're pulling off that pocket square . 
We are all gonna have a talk when we get home . 
You let it out . I knew you had it in you . 
Hey , look , um , decided I ... I 'm prepared to be the bigger person and look past your lie . Alan ? 
- Sorry. what ? You all right ? 
Wouldn 't say " no " to a drink . 
Allow me . Thank you . 
So ... you 've sort of been all over the place tonight . 
First , you were repelled by John , then you couldn 't let him go . Something you want to talk about ? 
Looking after John ... it stirred up a few things . 
Like what ? 
Well , you know I don 't have the closest relationship with my children . 
Um , my eldest daughter in particular has never forgiven me for ... what happened with her mother . Right , right . I know you haven 't spoken since . 
I 've tried , but it 's ... it 's-it 's been years . 
And then , about , well , four weeks ago , I-I found out from another relative that she 's pregnant . 
So , I called , and her husband told me that she still doesn 't want to speak . 
Now , part of me had thought when something like this happens , you know , all would be smoothed over , and bygones would finally be bygones , but , obviously not . 
Which hurts . 
I was , after all , her father . You 're still her father . 
Listen , I 'm sorry I got you wrapped up - into all this nonsense . - No , no , no . 
No . Actually , looking after John , I-I ... I felt better . Probably why I didn 't want it to end . 
You know , it 's the closest I 'll get to ... what I 'll be missing . 
For what it 's worth , um ... You know , a few years back , I ... I never really thought I 'd be in Freddy 's life again , but now , I can 't imagine my life without him . So ... I see that as your future , as well . 
You 're a good friend . 
Eve was way out of line about the pocket hankie . You know , I think it looks very dashing . Thank you . 
Thank you again for watching John . 
How are you so good with him ? I 've never seen him so quiet . 
I just rubbed a little whiskey on his gums . I laid out everything wrong with the Game of Thrones series . Passed right out . 
What do you dopes have to say for yourselves ? Roz , I ... I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are so disappointed in ourselves . 
I mean , we have been proven to be totally unreliable . I dare say we have lost the privilege of taking care of that baby forever . 
They tried so hard . They did not . They 're jerks . 
And as punishment , they 're gonna trade off watching John every week so that this woman can finally have break . 
But we 're so untrustworthy ! 
Well , that is why David will be watching you watch the baby for the next four months . 
There 's a play I really want to see in August . Five months . 
And Alan , obviously , you 're off the hook . 
We should just let the family clean up this mess . 
Right . 
Just a minute , Roz . I mean , um , Alan devised this whole scheme , and I think he should be punished , as well . As part of the family . 
I don 't care . Thank you , Roz . Ooh . 
Terry . Almost done . I 'll be there in ten . 
Really ? Terry ? 
He was cute .
